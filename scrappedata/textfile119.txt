The confusion as they fight to comprehend that which they cannot. Their lives cut off with such a pitiless act of brutality. And it is all for naught. Betrayal. The words of the wretched, twisted man who now stands before me echo mercilessly within my mind. The bastard sons of the queen. The schemes of the man who fought so desperately to be my father in order to use me. My mother and my lover. The queen… the queen who knows nothing of the man who gave her a son. Our son, who now fights for his life in the courtyard below. I look upon the man, and I cannot hope to hide the pain that courses through my veins. There are some secrets that should never be told. Some secrets that should never be known by those whom they concern. Ignorance is bliss.

I close my eyes, desperate to shut out this horror. I open them once more and I see the soldier. He meets my eye, and I look upon him with a question. He just shakes his head. He is gone, leaving me among the dead. I trace my hand along the blood that flows freely over the stones. Guilt. Pain. Death. My heart has slowed. The shock is gone.

ONE shot! So I just saw the movie Anonymous, if anything I will own it to watch The Earl of Southampton, I am thinking about starting a story but I am not sure yet. I am so glad that one person at least started a story for him, that makes me smile, so I hope you enjoy! Her hands trembled with absolute fear, her knees were starting to buckle but she kept her stance. What was she going to say to him? What was he going to respond with? How would everyone else feel, his family, her family, Oh my God the queen! She couldn't remember the last time she was ever this afraid. She had been pacing for the past couple of hours, the Doctor left and promised to keep this a secret, but she knew she couldn't hide it forever. \"You keep on pacing you are going to wear a hole in the stone itself.\" She heard, but she was too busy with her thoughts to reply, instead she asked a simple question \"How could this happen?\" \"Well there are many ways …\" her dearest friend Catherine was sitting with her, but she wasn't helping \"IT started when…\" \"Don't help Catherine!\" She said sitting down on the bed \"I know how it happened!\" She put her head in her trembling hands and started to shake her whole body \"How am I going to tell him?\" Catherine set her hand on her back and rubbed it \"Maybe he will understand, maybe he will be happy.\" Elizabeth held back a snide comment that tormented to emerge from her lips, \"Let me be alone for a while I need to gather my thoughts before I speak to him.\" Catherine sighed and stood up leaving the room to echo with cries of fear. Everything was going well when she and Henry started courting. She met Henry after the Queen herself introduced them at a Christmas party, and the moment that he kissed her hand was when the spark occurred, and he felt it as well. She loved the way that he looked, his hair long and as yellow as the sun, but his eyes were dark, she found himself drawn to his eyes more. They had many different meetings though she tried to hide his real feeling for him, she tried to play with him a little bit, and he seemed to like it, or he wouldn't have played. They didn't really show how much they liked each other, it was the night of passion that they had shared that would forever be in her memory, physically, emotionally, and mentally. She couldn't help but laugh out loud a small bit remembering his words \"You won't forget me.\" It may have sounded crude to the outside world but she understood what he meant. \"My God what am I going to do?\" She asked out loud to no one, her father would not approve, her mother would be so ashamed, and what was worse, she was afraid of what Henry would think of her. The more she thought the more her fingers trembled. Suddenly the door to her chambers opened but she didn't move, most likely it was Catherine wanting to say something else to make the situation worse. Instead of her voice however a deep almost musical voice echoed through the room \"I have never seen a woman in such distress that the room felt cold.\" Her head shot up and she looked the dark eyes, the full smiling lips, he leaned against the door almost too relaxed for her comfort. She tried to smile but it didn't work, she was just too upset. She looked back down on the floor \"I thought you were with the Earl of Oxford.\" She said quietly. \"You weren't supposed to come back until late tonight.\" His brow furrowed at the sudden sadness that fell on her, for the previous night she had nothing but smiles and laughter in her voice. That was what made him love her the way that he did. \"I was, unfortunately he said he had some more business to take care of, I thought you and I could spend some time together.\" He relieved his shoulder from the door and walked over to her, taking his fingers under her chin and lifting her head up \"What has milady so upset that she cannot look me in the eye?\" Elizabeth moved her head from his hand, \"I haven't been feeling well lately, Last night was the best that I have been feeling in a while, and well this morning I wasn't feeling well again.\" She managed to stand and looked at the table where her food still sat from breakfast this morning, \"I have been having a hard time taking care of her majesty because I haven't been feeling well.\" Her back was too him \"This morning I was physically ill and the queen sent be back to my room and she sent for the doctor…\" She didn't want to continue with the rest of her sentence. \"Maybe it is just a case of food poisoning.\" He tried to reason. Elizabeth shook her head no, \"But I felt fine last night, food poisoning doesn't do that.\" She said. He sat down on her bed \"What did the Doctor say?\" She turned back to look at him, her eyes were full of tears. She was too afraid to say, she started to shake and her knees trembled again, seeing this he stood back up and walked over to her, taking her face in his hand and kissing her on the lips, Her dark brown hair entwining in his fingers, \"Tell me, Elizabeth.\" She shook her head and suddenly the tears started to roll down her cheeks \"Elizabeth…Please, tell me what is going on, so that I know what to do.\" \"There is nothing you can do Henry.\" She said. Trying to get away from him, but he kept hold of her. He sighed with frustration looking into her earth colored eyes, green and brown mixed together, \"Elizabeth, is this sickness you have fatal…please at least tell me that?\" She closed her eyes and took a deep breath \"Only if I am not careful.\" He let go of her hair, the pieces were only vaguely falling into place, he stepped back from her turning away from her and looking at the bed and that was when she finally got the strength although it was quiet, the same time she said it was when the last piece fell into place, \"I am with child Henry.\" For a longest time it was quiet, Elizabeth took a seat in a chair next to the table, she could only hear his breathing, finally he spoke \"And it is mine?\" She would have been offended with the question if she wasn't terrified of him hating her, he was the first one that she had been with that way. \"Of course, Henry, I was with no one else but you.\" She said trying to sound calm. He turned and looked her for a moment his eyes were darker than what they usually were, he wasn't angry though, but she couldn't exactly read him either, she turned her eyes away from him, setting her hand over her mouth, her index finger covering her lips. He took a couple of steps, looking down at her \"I need some time to think.\" With that he excused himself from her chamber. As soon as the door was shut the tears started to fall from her eyes. She was uncontrollably shaking. She couldn't move from Henry walked past Catherine who was staring at him with worry, when he caught her gaze , he looked at her \"Did you know?\" Catherine nodded \"She was on my shoulder in tears since she found out, I am the only one that she has been able to talk to.\" He sighed and walked down the hallway, Catherine of course bolted down the hallway to Elizabeth's room, seeing her frozen, she moved quietly \"Did he say anything?\" She asked concerned over her true friend. Elizabeth was silent for a minute when she finally did speak she only said one thing. \"I have to tend to the queen.\" With that she stood and left her chambers. \"You are sure your feeling better than?\" Elizabeth nodded to the queen, bowing her head \"I am feeling much better thank you, your majesty.\" \"You seem distracted.\" \"There is a lot on my mind, I just need to think about work more, your majesty.\" The silence overcame the room, but the queen nodded \"I spoke with the Earl of Southampton this morning, he is quite a strapping young man.\" 'More than you know.' Elizabeth thought \"He seems to think well of you.\" The queen said 'He did.' She corrected mentally \"And his love for plays, and music, I would say he is very intelligent.\" \"I agree with you, your majesty. He is very intelligent.\" She said quietly following the queen down the hallway, \"I have heard that William Shakespeare has done another play, do you know anything about it?\" \"Now your majesty, I have only showed a small interest in his sonnets.\" \"What a shame, I wanted to know about it.\" Elizabeth had to admit one thing, this was helping her with the thought of Henry, for a minute. That night Elizabeth made sure that the Queen was asleep in bed before turning in herself, she looked at two of the young ladies in waiting \"Now remember I am a couple of doors down if she needs anything then tell me.\" \"Yes ma'am.\" As soon as she got to her room Elizabeth sat down to take another breath it a breath of hope. Henry hadn't spoken to her since she told him and she was in fear of what he was going to do. He had the power to have her killed if it came to that, She knew that, and she feared it. She got into a night gown and tried to go to sleep, but it didn't come easily. Just as she was starting to drift into a slumber, there was a knock on her door. She rolled over and looked at the door, sighing with no relief. \"She has only been in bed for a half an hour, there is no possible way that she could need anything now.\" She murmured, sitting up and covering herself \"Alright I am coming.\" She said walking over to the door and opening. She was overwhelmed by a familiar scent as it rushed into the room and strong arms locked themselves around her, lips landed on her mouth and took in her kisses, she didn't know what to think until he let go of her \"I promised you that you would remember me, I am not about to leave you now.\" He kissed her again, she was overcome with tears again and started to cry while he kissed her. He broke away to wipe the tears away \"I went for a walk after you told me, I didn't know what I was going to do, I didn't know how I was going to tell the queen, I didn't know how I was going to protect our name without getting ourselves hurt, now I know what I am going to do. We have no choice but to marry, but…\" Elizabeth saw right through what he was saying \"It's death if we do , Henry.\" \"I am not letting my child be labeled a bastard. We are getting married in secret, we have too.\" He touched her face again and kissed her once more \"I will do anything to keep you safe.\" She couldn't help but smile at him, the same smile that she gave when they met, \"You can prove that one way my dear.\" She tugged him over to the bed \"Stay with me.\" He smiled and his dark eyes sparked \"If Milady wants.\" Early in the morning Elizabeth felt a kiss on her temple \"I must leave early Milady, and you must wake, the Queen will be waking soon.\" Elizabeth only moved a little bit but nodded \"Alright.\" She said sleepily. He couldn't help but smile at her, she was an angel herself. Elizabeth was the sun herself when she got up she was full of smiles and laughter that she was a couple days ago \"Well you are looking much better today.\" The queen complimented. \"A good night sleep makes all the difference.\" \"I have a meeting with the Earl of Southampton and the earl of Essex today, I wish to have my blue dress with the high collar around the back.\" \"Yes Your majesty.\" She helped her get ready \"You are a very trusted friend of mine Elizabeth, I must thank you for that.\" \"There is no need to thank me your majesty, I am honored that you think of me as such.\" Elizabeth escorted her to the court and she took a seat in her throne \"Thank you ladies you are excused.\" She took a bow and left the court taking a seat at the bench next to the doors, Catherine walked over and sat next to her \"So?\" \"What?\" Elizabeth asked with a slight smile on her face \"He talked to you didn't he?\" She asked hopeful. She nodded \"Last night, he is willing to stay, we don't know how we are going to tell the queen but we are going to tell her none the less.\" Catherine couldn't help but hug her friend \"He is happy about being a father, though I think it is because he knows that means sons.\" \"Nonsense he loves you more than anything in the world everyone sees it.\" She laughed \"Well he definitely shows it when people are not looking as well, anyway, he is a good man, and I am glad he is at least taking the responsibility.\" \"Of course.\" After a couple hours of talking and reading the bible, the doors finally opened and Catherine and Elizabeth jumped to their feet to follow the queen down the hallway. \"Leave me both of you, please, I will speak to you both later.\" She said suddenly. Both Girls were in surprise but bowed anyway. Elizabeth walked back to her room to see Henry sitting in one of the chairs, his hands were folded over his mouth, he was as white as a ghost, when he looked at her, his face only paled more. \"Henry? What is it.\" \"I spoke with the Queen today…\" \"Yes I remember, what, what happened?\" panic went through her, she really didn't want to know. \"She is sending me on a voyage, I will be gone for nine months.\" This time Elizabeth's hands started to shake for sadness \"I leave tomorrow.\" \"What am I going to do about the baby?\" \"I don't know..\" She sat down across from him and looked at him \"I cant hide a baby for that ling, people are going to get curious.\" \"I know…\" He got out of the chair and took her hand and kissed it \"I wouldn't do this if it wasn't the queen.\" Elizabeth nodded \"I am worried.\" \"I am too.\" He leaned in and kissed her. He stayed with her again that night, he kept hold of her all night, but he didn't sleep, he just looked over her, watching her sleep, he didn't want to be away from her. He promised himself to marry her when he got back. For now, this was all that mattered. When Elizabeth woke up that morning there was nothing but a note next to her as she read it she started to cry one more time My Dearest Elizabeth, I am afraid to say goodbye to you, but remember how much I will love you, you will never forget me that is a promise. I loved you from the moment I saw you, and that shall never end. Henry. ","Summary":" Elizabeth Vernon has a confession to make, and it may or may not make the Earl of Southampton happy"},{"Movie":"Anonymous","Title":"From the Heart of Hidden Truth","Author":"Molahsurey","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10157926","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Edward, the Earl of Oxford, was more than happy to be reunited with Henry, the Earl of Southampton, his son. If Elizabeth had let him be executed he would have been devastated, especially since he had yet to tell Henry of their relation. It started out that Edward wasn't allowed to tell his son who he really was, but as Henry got older it turned into the fact that it was just too hard to admit; but now that a secret had been revealed to Edward it would be even harder, but he had to do it, now was the time. It wasn't the most ideal thing to find out, that your former lover, the love of your life, turns out to be your own mother and that you had a child together. But Edward loved Elizabeth nonetheless, it was a true love and nothing could ruin that, though it was information that was hard to bear. He had unknowingly committed incest and now he had to live with it, it was a bit crippling and more than a bit upsetting but there could be no changing the fact. And now, as he looked at his son, he began to feel that maybe he could commit it again willingly, if this young man would allow it. Their relationship had always been platonic; it shouldn't be too hard to push it even further. He had always felt a strange spark whenever he was in his son's presence. He wasn't sure if this disgusted him or not, of course it did, it disgusted him with Elizabeth, it was unsettling, but it was what he felt. If it happened so easily with his mother then why couldn't he feel the same way about his son? After the two men had pulled away from their embrace Edward grabbed Henry gently by the arm and pulled him carefully over to a nearby bench. Edward sat down with the younger man, the gorgeous Earl of Southampton, and looked him in the eye before taking hold of his hand and gripping it firmly. He took a deep breath, taking a moment to gather his wits, before speaking, \"You and I have always been close.\" He paused, searching Henry's eyes before continuing, \"But I feel it's time for me to explain why that is.\" Henry's features became confused and he shook his head, \"There is no need for explanation. You and I are close because you're an amazing man who I admire. We're great friends. Ever since I first met you I've looked up to you. I am so grateful for your friendship.\" The Earl of Oxford closed his eyes for a moment, taking in those sweet utterances. He opened them again with a sigh, \"No, that's not what I mean. What you say is true, but there's more than that.\" He shook Henry's hand a bit, gearing himself up, \"I should have told you a long time ago… You're my son.\" There was nothing but pure eye contact, both men staring intensely at the other, their hands never disconnecting. No sounds could be heard, everything went silent; they saw nothing but one another, some weird kind of tunnel vision. Edward took a shaky breath in, the moment a bit too profound, the feelings too raw. He swallowed in anticipation as to what Henry might say; he prayed he'd speak soon. Henry couldn't take his eyes off his best friend, the man he had always confided in. He should have guessed long ago that their connection was far too immense to be just of coincidental friendship. Edward was his mentor, his shield, his source of comfort and strength. Now that he knew the truth it all felt concrete, every experience they had shared together. It had more purpose. He too swallowed, gripping his father's hand tighter, trying to convey without words how much this confession meant to him. Finally he was able to get words out, \"I wish I had known sooner…\" He felt his eyes begin to tear up, \"I never would have followed Essex.\" He shook his head, attempting to shake off the shock, \"Why was this information kept from me?\" This is where the real hard part was and it frightened Edward to the core, what words were the correct ones to use in such a situation? He thought hard for a moment, his head pounding. \"I was ignorant to who I was as well,\" he chose to say, \"I didn't know who my family was.\" He swallowed again. \"I fell in love.\" A flash of the first time he saw Elizabeth shot through his mind. \"The woman I gave my heart to betrayed me. Everything was complicated.\" He let his eyes close again, this was it, \"I've recently been informed that the woman I've been in love with, the woman that I conceived with… was my own mother, the queen.\" He didn't dare open his eyes right after admitting that. That threw Henry for a spell, that couldn't possibly be true. He wasn't upset; he wasn't disgusted with Edward, it wasn't his fault, he understood that. It just felt odd. It was confusing to think about. Incest… It wasn't something people had to think about often. But it shouldn't matter, what was done was done, they were both there now, and what they needed more than anything was each other. Then he realized they were still holding hands and a strange feeling shot through him. He didn't want to explore his reaction any further but it was of no use to fight the inevitable, he would think about it eventually. If Edward, his father, had done such a thing, whether he meant to or not, would he be so opposed to doing it again? It had already been done once, why not once more? But then he thought if he could, could he possibly commit such an act? He figured that since he was a bastard incest child then there was no reason he couldn't, life had already damned him before he was even able to damn himself. He spoke softly, \"Don't hide from me; open your eyes. It's alright …father.\" It felt liberating to say that, to address him as whom he really was; his chest swelled at the sound of it. \"There's nothing to be ashamed of, if anyone should be ashamed, it's God.\" Edward's eyes flashed open, he was surprised at the words but he spoke softly, \"Don't be blasphemous.\" It was quite hypocritical for him to say so since he didn't care much for the idea of God anyway. He gave a sad smile, looking down at his son's hand in his, \"I'm so glad you're my son.\" There was an awkward silence; neither knew what else to say. But words weren't needed, the energy radiating from each of them was enough, it was calming in a way, soothing and comforting. Their eyes eventually found each other's again and they stared into one another's gaze, this time with understanding. In that moment one word escaped Edward's lips, \"Henry.\" Not Henry his student or comrade, but Henry his son, his flesh and blood. Something about hearing his name come from Edward's mouth like that triggered an urge in Henry, a sporadic impulse. He moved closer without really thinking. His eyes conveyed a message that Edward never would have thought they would, it was of love, but not the kind that one would expect. But Edward showed no protest in his own eyes so Henry took that as a sign to fulfill his unexpected desire, the desire to kiss the man in front of him. In one swift yet incredibly slow motion movement Henry's lips were upon Edward's. Edward's brow creased but he was not repulsed, he was entranced. In reaction he brought a hand up to Henry's cheek, holding him fast, making sure their lips remained in contact. His heart thrummed at an incredible pace, his heart and head overflowing with bliss. He could only hope that Henry felt the same; he did. Images began to flash through Edward's mind of past occurrences with Elizabeth until they began to turn into flashes of past moments with Henry, until eventually they faded away to the current moment, this knew experience with Henry. Nothing could have been better than it was right then. The kiss was soft, sweet, and gentle; it was one of the most heartfelt in existence. It was unspoken love, but it was the most powerful way of expressing it. He already knew Henry loved him, as a friend and as a father, but this solidified that knowledge, and he embraced this form of certainty with everything he had. He was never going to let it go. And all he could do was return it.

Olhei ao redor confirmando que a praia estava deserta e então me sentei na areia, fechei os olhos e fiquei ouvindo o barulho que as ondas faziam, sentindo a brisa que vinha do oceano batendo em meu rosto.Não sei o que havia acontecido, mas ficar sozinha estava sendo mesmo um grande presente. Devia ser meu subconsciente percebendo que eu precisava relaxar. A praia era muito bonita. Cercada com uma areia branquíssima que contrastava com o mar, que era muito azul. Dava pra ser cenário para um filme romântico, no por do sol então seria perfeito. Mas eu não quero pensar em romance agora, não com a minha vida amorosa desse jeito, tendo que sonhar com um personagem de livro pra não sonhar com um amor não correspondido. Já era fim de tarde e o sol não devia estar muito longe de se pôr. E eu não gostava nada da idéia de ficar sozinha naquela praia deserta durante a noite. Levei um susto enorme quando uma voz masculina sussurrou em meu ouvido: - Desculpe por isso, mas a espera já está doendo em mim. Fico indignado de você estar sonhando com um cara que nem existe. Queria que você sonhasse, uhn, comigo. Eu fiquei sem reação por alguns segundos, aquela voz realmente me encantou, e quando me virei pra ver quem era o telefone aqui de casa tocou e eu pelo menos ter agradecido por esse tempo sozinha. E quando eu fui levantar pra atender o telefone, minha mãe atendeu.

Those other guys are certainly not. He is cool right from the start. He is a teenage Braveheart. He's willing to try new things. He gives new stuff a whirl. He's a ladies' man also when it comes to the girls! He is quite a Don Juan. And he knows how to move on the football field. When Lainie Diamond broke up with her boyfriend Joel at the dance on Saturday night, her fate with Bobby was sealed. Lainie had a calling. She loved to leap and prance. When Bobby found her in the gym one day, He smiled as she practiced her dance. When she became Bobby's girlfriend, She felt it was like a song. She believed that Bobby was the boy for her. She just hadn't seen it all along. Bobby watched Lainie with a smile as she danced in the gym. He knew it had all came down to this. He also believed only one thing. She, of course, was now his.

He was bored out of his mind. He looked over to his left seeing Bobby dead asleep. Dinger sighed. He turned over on his side, and started to poke Bobby. \"Bobby-\" *poke* \"Bobby-\" *poke* \"Bob-\" *smack!* \"Ow what the hell was that for?\" Dinger asked rubbing his now throbbing head. \"Oh I wonder, hmmm maybe it was for all the pokes, now what do you want Dinger?\" Bobby asked irritated sitting up. \"Well I was bored\" Dinger started sitting up too. \"Is that it?\" Bobby asked with a yawn. \"No, and I was curious about something\" Dinger replied. \"Yeah, well what is it?\" Bobby asked looking straight at Dinger. \"Well, I really want to know why or how much you like me.\" Dinger said with a blush. Bobby smiled and spoke in a cool voice. \" Well the first time was a great time, and the second time was a blast, third time I fell in love and I really hope what we have lasts.\" Bobby started to sing his voice was in perfect harmony. He moved so he was kneeling in front of Dinger who was at this point as red as an tomato. Bobby continued to sing. \" You got the right stuff, baby ,love the way you turn me on ,you got the right stuff, baby you're the reason why I sing this song ,all that I needed was you. Oh , you're so right all that I wanted was you. You made all my dreams come true\" Bobby stopped singing and asked. \"Do you need to know more?\" \"Just a little more\" Dinger answered with a smile. Bobby smiled back and started where he left off. \" Your first kiss was a sweet kiss ,second kiss had a twist ,third and your fourth kiss ,I don't want to miss\" And with that said Bobby pressed his lips against Dinger's. As they pulled away Bobby pressed their foreheads together and whispered- \" In my life, you're so right, you made all... you know what you did…\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I do not own Dream A Little Dream, the song \"You Got It (The Right Stuff)\" belongs to"},{"Movie":"Dream a Little Dream","Title":"Dream a Little Dream: One Week Later","Author":"Nightcrawlerlover","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11660938","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hey there, my fellow writers and readers... :) Here's a new oneshot I cooked up one day while watching the 1989 film Dream a Little Dream, which is a really neat movie to watch (as well as be inspired to write by). Plus, I highly recommend it because it features awesome performances by Corey Feldman, Corey Haim and Meredith Salenger. Disclaimer: The geniuses at Lionsgate Pictures own Dream a Little Dream (along with the late, great Marc Rocco (June 19, 1962 – May 1, 2009), who was also a genius, as well as an awesome director) . The lyrics to Rockstar by Nickelback belong to their respective owners. I own the fanfics that I cook up from time to time. Dream a Little Dream: One Week Later My name is Bobby Keller. I'm eighteen years old, I love rock and roll, and I'm a typical teenager... or at least, I used to be. Now, I'm different in my perspective of the world, thanks to an experiment that Coleman Ettinger had done. He had also learned some things from looking at life through my eyes as well. But I still dress like Michael Jackson, as he's my favorite singer. That day, I was wearing a white shirt with a picture of a red car, a blue coat with a silver wings pin on the left breast pocket and black Levis. On my feet were white socks covered by black penny loafers. An aqua headband wound itself around my head, and a fedora of black sat upon my head as waves of my raven hair fell straight down my back. I looked pretty cool – at least from my perspective. Venturing outside, I headed towards the grassy area so I could sit quietly under a tree with my friends, Joel and Dumas. \"Hey, Death Dude?\" a voice asked. Dumas and Joel looked up from where they were sitting, wondering what was going to happen now. I stopped and looked, smirking, in the direction of the voice. Callie Matheson had other ideas, beckoning me to her table. So, I walked over to her. Callie gave me the once over. \"Love the get-up!\" she sneered. \"What do you want, Callie?\" I replied. \"Well, it's like this... um...\" Callie looked to the heavens, as though she had forgotten my name. I gave her a sickly sweet smile. \"Bobby.\" \"Oh yeah, of course. Bobby,\" she said mockingly. \"Name doesn't really suit someone of your... type.\" Much to Callie's confusion, I smirked at her. Seeing my smirk, the other girls looked at each other, confused. \"Why is he smiling?\" said one. \"It's like he thinks Callie is complimenting him or something,\" another remarked. I had had enough. But I was smart to have walked over in the first place. And as if Callie didn't know better, she could've sworn she saw my eyes were glowing green or something – just like a cat's eyes when the cat is struck with jealousy. However, what I said next is something even I will remember forever. \"Look, Callie,\" I said, \"I don't appreciate you hitting on me, and I don't think your friends would, either. So why don't you just do me a favor and stay out of my life?\" A puzzled expression replaced Callie's smile, but before she could think of a reply, witty or not, I gave my black hair a flick before heading over to where Joel and Dumas were sitting. Having heard the whole exchange, they were shocked that their eyes bugged out as I walked up to them, then sat down with them. Dumas was eighteen, and had been a bully, as well as the leader of a gang. He once punched me in the face one night while I was on a date with Lainie Diamond, giving me a fat lip in the process. The reason why was that he wanted revenge on me for beating him in a fight on the soccer field that day at school. But when I referred to him as my friend in an alleyway outside a club when Joel was about to kill him with a gun, he felt remorseful and started to rethink the bully image he had. Joel is eighteen, as well as a friend of mine. He had been a victim of a hot temper, but thanks to my talking to him and some intervention on the part of my friend Dinger, he got some help. He even dated Lainie once, but when she found out the truth about him – that he just wanted the same thing he wanted from all women – she dumped him, and at the dance on Saturday, which I still remember quite vividly, even now... \"You know what, Joel? Just hit me. It has nothing to do with Bobby. It was you , what you wanted. You don't care about me!\" Lainie hissed. \"Well, I do, and I want out!\" \"You know very well you're mine!\" Joel roared while grabbing her by the arms. A look of shock crossed my face; one mark of a true gentleman was never mistreating a lady, and I could never do that. \"Just beat off!\" she shrieked. Joel then pushed her to the ground. He heard my voice yell \"Hey!\" and felt me pushing him away a little before Dinger took over. \"You OK?\" I said to Lainie while holding her hand. She nodded before she and I looked up and over at where the others were. Dinger warned me to get Lainie out of there, and I knew he was serious. Helping Lainie to her feet, I then took off while still holding onto her hand so we wouldn't get separated. I got her out to my car, and we drove to this really cool club. Once there, we danced to Young At Heart by Frank Sinatra. When she was with me, she felt safe. Protected. She had finally realized that the guy for her had been me the whole time; she just didn't see it at first. Now, having opened her eyes to the truth, she saw Joel for what he had been like back then. Anyway, I then asked, \"What are you staring at?\" \"You, dude,\" replied Dumas. \"I got to tell you, Bobby, that must've been... quite the exchange between you two. She must've had it coming... or something along those lines, I think.\" I nodded. I had been pushed around by Callie Matheson for too long. It was time I stood up and took the upper hand. And that day was today. Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars And live in Hilltop houses driving fifteen cars The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap We'll all stay skinny ‛cause we just won't eat And we'll hang out in the coolest bars in the VIP with the movie stars Every good gold digger's Gonna wind up there Every Playboy bunny With her bleach blond hair And we'll hide out in the private rooms With the latest dictionary of today's who's who They'll get you anything with that evil smile Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar \"Bobby, dude, was she really hitting on you?\" asked Joel. \"It sounded like it to me,\" I replied smoothly. Dumas and Joel looked at each other before smiling. Then we started talking about other things. After all, we are friends, and friends do spend time with each other. Nice feedback is very much appreciated, of course – as it i nspire s me to cook up more stories . (Also, Alex Rocco (February 29, 1936 – July 18, 2015), who played Gus Keller in Dream a Little Dream, died four months ago from cancer. Both he and his adopted son Marc, who was said to be a great artist and storyteller, will be missed, although their legacies live on...

Well, here's a new Alternate Universe Dream a Little Dream fic I cooked up one day while watching the 2004 film Catwoman, which I like as a matter of fact - mostly because of Halle Berry's portrayal of Patience Phillips/Catwoman in it. I hope you like it! :) Disclaimer: Genius Marc Rocco owns the 1989 film Dream a Little Dream. The lyrics to Scandalous by Mis-Teeq belong to their respective owners. Also, a few lines I put in here are from the 1992 film Batman Returns, while a few others are from the 2004 film Catwoman (but different, as I changed them to fit this fic). I own the songfics, oneshots and ficlets I cook up from time to time. Cat Eyes In the Night \"Now, don't scream, and I won't kill you.\" His hot breath warmed her ear. Sally knew she couldn't scream, even if she wanted to. He'd knocked all the air out of her with that last punch. His one hand was firm against her mouth and she whined as his fingers bit down into her cheeks. His other hand was already fumbling around with the waistband to her shorts. She sobbed and hitched under his hand. His grip tightened, and it felt as if her jaw might just give up and break. \"Now, be quiet,\" he said, pushing her head back into the alley's brick wall. Sally saw stars for a moment. She chewed the inside of her mouth trying not to scream anymore. Her waist moved and jived with his hand. He was pulling the band, trying to rip it off, and only succeeding in frustrating himself. Harder and harder he pulled by the moment Sally could feel the band digging into her flesh. \"Just the thing I needed,\" he said and pushed her to the cold, slimy ground. Sally saw her chance and was immediately on her feet. She pumped her legs as hard as she ever had before yet it felt like she was in a slow dream. The alley seemed as long as eternity. A car passed at the end of eternity. Then Sally remembered she could scream. She pushed the trapped wail out of her lungs. It bounced off his hand and back down her throat. His hand clamped her jaw and she squealed underneath his grasp. He spun her around, his other hand wielding a silver blade. She could see the lights of freedom reflecting off the blade. Then there was a shadow as if movement. As if…no, just her hopeful imagination. He smiled with yellow teeth and the stench of numerous smoked weeds. \"I'm fast, huh?\" he said with a sick pride. \"Now I told you, as long as you listened and stayed quiet, I wouldn't kill you. I made a promise to you, and I never break a promise. I don't really want to hurt you, anyway. Who would want to hurt such a beautiful young lady such as...well, yourself?\" She heard his zipper come down and felt something soft poke her skin. \"I love you.\" He let go of her mouth then, and Sally might have screamed, but now both his hands and his knife was at her waistband. She could feel the cold metal against her belly. Then there was a prick and he cut through the waistband. Her waist expanded minutely and there was a small giggle of glee from her assailant. Then her shorts were around her ankles, and then her white panties were there as well. She felt herself being lowered to the cold ground and gasped. She told herself this wasn't her body, that no matter what, this wasn't her body. He smiled the happiest smile ever. Sally looked into his eyes and instantly knew what he was. He was an incarnation of the devil, and he was encased in an angel's shell in order to tempt her. And, boy, did he tempt her. Then, there it was again, a shadow from the rooftops, something moving. Then it all happened so fast nobody really knew what was going on. The shadow dropped from the roof and grabbed Sally's rapist by his neck. The shadow held tight and the rapist gasped. He beat against the shadow's arm, flailing and kicking his legs, but it was no use. The shadow held strong, unflinching. Finally, Sally's assailant went limp. The shadow dropped him to the ground and turned to go. Sally quickly got back up and pulled up her shorts. Her savior walked over to her and gallantly held out his hand. She placed her hand in his, and he pulled her up. Then for the first time, she saw his face. He had dark chocolate eyes, which he hid behind black sunglasses, and long hair that was the color of a raven's wings. Yet she could still see his eyes behind the sunglasses…sort of. The music coming from the nightclub a few feet away pounded so much in her ears that it almost sounded like her heartbeat. She was sure he could hear it too.

Then after lifting her hand to his lips and kissing it gallantly, he took off, leaping through the night sky. She smiled to herself. Bobby Keller couldn't help but smile to himself. Being Night Cat was a lot of fun. He then remembered how he had gotten to be the way he was, and smiled. One night, everything had changed. His former boss was twenty-four year-old Tenchi Okama from Japan. Tenchi had a bad side, and was often known for walking all over people whom he considered weak. When Bobby had accidentally discovered a secret about Tenchi and Tenchi confronted him about it, Bobby simply looked him in the eyes and said, \"Okay. Go ahead. Intimidate me. Bully me if it makes you feel big. I mean it's not like you can just kill me.\" That was all it took. It was then that Tenchi had pushed Bobby out of a window. Then he was found, and bitten by, a man they called Catman. The bite…transformed him. Bobby could leap up walls, move a lot quicker, and he was even able to land on his feet. Anyway, now he landed on top of a nightclub – a different one. He sensed his prey – Tenchi – coming, and snuck in through a window. For a while he simply watched as Tenchi sat, listening to the music. Then, when he saw Tenchi walking out a back door and into an alley, he made his move. Before Tenchi knew what was happening, he was pushed to the ground and turned over. His eyes widened in both recognition and horror when he saw who it was. \"Bobby Keller!\" he said. Bobby smirked. \"The other night,\" he purred, \"you killed somebody. He was a nice boy. Why did you kill him?\" Bobby then reached down and grabbed Tenchi's tongue. \"What's the matter?\" he said mockingly. \"Cat got your tongue?\" Then, when he got off of Tenchi, he got to his feet. Bobby seized the opportunity to deliver the first stunning blow with a whirligig kick. Tenchi was knocked out…for good. Bobby then leaped up a wall and onto the top of a building. Then he sat there Indian style. He smirked to himself. Yep, being Bobby Keller and Night Cat was a lot of fun. Then Miss Kitty, Catwoman's cat, was suddenly sitting beside him. \"I don't know about you, Miss Kitty,\" Bobby purred, \"but I feel so much yummier.\" Well, I hope you like it!

Finally, I was back to my normal self. Same boring house, same boring breakfast, and same boring body. However, things didn't go so well while I switched bodies with that old man according to Dinger. \"Dinger, what happened while I was gone?\" I asked him. I knew I could trust him I mean we've been best friends since 1st grade, he would never lie to me unless it was something I truly didn't want to hear. \"You really wanna know Bobby?\" He asked me seriously, not taking his eyes off of me. Of course I wanted know, what was an old man doing with my body? I have a right to know for Christ sake. \"Why, is it something I would have to keep my mouth shut about?\" I asked curiously. \"Well…Well,\" Dinger trailed off. \"Well…Well what Dings? C'mon I can handle it TELL ME!\" I yelled, shaking him vigorously. Why wouldn't he tell me? What's gotten into him lately? All I wanna know is what happened, that's all….Nothing else. \"If I tell you, will you promise not to be mad at me?\" he asked, looking scared. \"Ok, I promise I won't be mad at you.\" I replied calmly. \"Ok….well….uh……Bobby.\" Dinger said hoping I wouldn't get mad at him. \"I don't know how to say this but…..while you were gone….Lainie Diamond's body was taken over by the old man's wife.\" He told me, looking like I was gonna freak. Of course I knew about Lainie and the old dude's wife, but that's not what I wanted to hear. I mean Lainie thought I was weird and stupid. Yeah I was in love with her but that's in the past now. Besides, only a bitch would date someone like Joel then leave him for a guy like me. \"Ok, then what happened to me and Lainie?\" I asked. I really wanted to know what happened during those last three days. I felt like a dentist pulling teeth, like the time my molar wouldn't come out when I was 7. It took about an hour to get it out, of course I remember crying from the pain. \"Bobby…..\" Dinger looked at me carefully. \"During the past three days….Lainie left Joel for you, and….. you…..you went out with her and kissed her behind Joel's back.\" He finished. \"WHAT!\" I screamed in fury. I couldn't believe what I just heard. \"You promised you wouldn't be mad at me.\" said Dinger, thinking I was blaming him for all this crap. \"I'm not Dings, I mean c'mon….I kissed Lainie? I don't even have feelings for anymore.\" I said, not believing what had told. \"Well it's true, and Joel blamed this whole thing on you and he took it out on me.\" Dinger replied, trying to get me to calm down. \"No… no no no no No No No NO!\" I screamed, dropping to my knees in agony. \"I didn't wanna tell you dude, Joel beat the crap out of you when he saw you two together\" said Dinger, feeling like a stupid jerk for telling me the truth. \"I think….I think….I think I'm gonna be sick.\" I said, literally feeling sick to my stomach. 5 minutes later I was in the bathroom vomiting like crazy. That old man had no right to mess around with my body just to get with his wife though Lainie's body. This was insane, how could this have happened? If Lainie would've looked where she was going while riding on her bike that night, then this wouldn't have happened. Why was everyone blaming it on me? I didn't mean to cause a rage of chaos that would haunt me for the rest of my life. This was like that movie Freaky Friday , only the accident happened on a Thursday and I switched bodies with an old man instead of Lainie. \"That's it, let it all out my friend,\" said Dinger gently patting me on the back. \"Is everything alright up there?\" Mrs. Holfield yelled from downstairs. \"Yeah Mom everything's fine!,\" Dinger yelled back while I threw up for the tenth time. \"Bobby just had too many hotdogs!\" \"This is ridiculous I can't believe I actually kissed her!\" I said, still feeling sick to my stomach. \"You kissed, I almost got beaten up by Joel would you wanna switch sides?\" He said sarcastically. I threw up again, God this was like the flu that wouldn't end. \"I didn't think so dude,\" He replied to my excessive vomiting. Samantha who happened to be Dinger's older sister came into the bathroom over hearing the sound of my constant vomiting. Dinger was the middle child in his family, Samantha was the oldest and his other sister Rachel (who attended Catholic school) was the youngest. However, Samantha was a year older than Dinger, nineteen years old and in the same grade as him and I. She had dark chocolate brown hair and gorgeous chocolate brown eyes. Of course she was originally from a different school before, but she transferred to get away from a bunch of students who were harassing her in her Freshman year. Of course she repeated the year when she was fifteen, but she was happy being the oldest in the Senior year. \"What happened?\" she asked, checking to see if I was okay. \"Remember when I told about the accident with Bobby and Lainie?\" Dinger asked his sister, hoping she would remember. She was the only person who knew about the accident, apparently her and Dinger never told my parents the truth, otherwise they wouldn't believe them. \"Yeah why?\" she asked her brother, concerned about me. \"This is why,\" Dinger replied after I was finished. \"I thought Bobby was with Shelly?\" she asked curiously. \"He broke up with Shelly after he apologized to the old dude,\" Dinger told Samantha. \"Oh yeah you're right I forgot about that,\" she replied, looking at me as I almost pasted out. Eventually Dinger caught me, Samantha looked at her brother giving him a serious look. \"Make sure that thing isn't backed up, you don't Mom and Dad asking questions now do you?\" she asked, looking at him hoping she would trust him. \"Yeah I know, they never stop asking when a piece of evidence is left behind,\" He told Samantha. Dinger and Samantha were really good at hiding things from their parents, unless they had to tell the truth. \"By the way, Lainie's a bitch,\" she said, being honest. \"She didn't know that Joel was an ass from the day she met him, and Shelly is way too aggressive. She thinks she can control every guy she dates,\" she said to Dinger. \"Then will you go out with me?\" I asked Samantha. How stupid can I be? There's no way Samantha would wanna go out with me. I mean she hates all the guys in school. They were way too immature for her age anyway. \"Well, I do think you're very charming and especially romantic,\" she said with a sweet smile. How could Samantha change her mind just like that? \"So is that a yes?\" I asked, trying not to sound so sound desperate. \"Yes,\" she replied kissing me gently on the cheek. Her lips were soft like rose petals brushing against my skin. I hugged her tightly thanking her, she ran her fingers through my hair to help me calm down. I knew I could trust Samantha, after all she's known me since we were little kids. Plus she was born with a balance of beauty and brains. She may be a gorgeous brunette, but she has the mind of genius. Something completely rare that other girls in school didn't have. \"It's getting late, you boys should get some sleep,\" she said, \"and I promise I won't tell anyone,\" she smiled, keeping her word. \"Yeah, I'm bushed; c'mon Bobby, time to hit the hay,\" said Dinger pulling my arm. \"Yeah whatever Dinger,\" I replied as he pulled me into his room. A few minutes later I drifted off to sleep, dreaming about Samantha and the kiss she had given me a few minutes ago. I could tell dating her would make feel like the luckiest guy in all of my teen years, no pun intended.

We never sit around the tree singing cobia\" Dinger replied. Bobby laughed. \"Dinger you don't sit around the tree and where the hell did you get the whole cobia thing from?\" Bobby asked as he started to walk. \"I really have no idea dude\" Dinger said following his friend down the side walk. Minutes later they reached Bobby's house. Walking up the porch Bobby turned \"Okay Dinger since you followed me home I guess you can stay over\" Bobby said running his fingers through his hair. \"Yes, thanks man I owe you\" Dinger said walking into the house with Bobby right behind him. It was rounding midnight and the boys were downstairs watching some Christmas movie. Things were silent between until Dinger spoke. \"Man, I'm bored\" Dinger whined. \"Well what do you want me to do about it?\" Bobby replied what a yawn. \"I don't know, umm show me some of your dance moves\" Dinger said with a smile. \"No way man, I'm too tired for that\" Bobby answered. Dinger turned away so Bobby couldn't see the disappointment in his face. Then he eyed a pillow laying on the floor next to him. He smirked. \"Hey Bobby.\" \"What Dinger?\" Bobby didn't get a voice replied but what he did get was a pillow in his face. \"Oh you are so dead man\" Bobby said tackling Dinger. Bobby had Dinger pinned under him, he started to tickle his sides. \"Say uncle\" Bobby said \"Never\" Dinger replied with a laugh. Dinger stopped laughing as his eyes focused on something hanging from the ceiling. Bobby stopped what he was doing and asked \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothing, just that\" Dinger said pointing up.

Dinger quickly pulled away, his face was all red from embarrassment. \"Sorry Bobby I didn't mean to-\" Dinger was cut off by Bobby's lips on his. When they pulled away their foreheads were still touching. \"Don't be sorry Dinger, I've wanted to do that for a while and by the way your cute when your embarrassed \" Bobby said with a smile. Dinger blushed \"Thanks Bobby.\" \"Anytime\" Bobby replied pulling Dinger into an embrace. \"Hey Bobby\" \"Yeah Dinger\" \"Merry Christmas\" \"Merry Christmas Dinger\" Bobby replied giving Dinger a kiss on the forehead. \"Best Christmas ever\" Dinger thought to himself.

He's twice as good looking as I am and he's never had a girlfriend. Yea that's it, I just feel sorry for him. I had been ignoring Dinger all this week to pay more attention to Lainie, and to push aside OTHER thoughts. I was walking down the school halls with her until Dinger came crashing through looking upset. \"What's up with you ignoring me all this week Bobby?

Just a scene, or something like it that, I would have liked to have seen in the film. Ordinary Days Lalita finally found her way to the beach, it'd been quite confusing but since she had insisted that she would find her way there instead of waiting until the next afternoon when Kholi would be free to take she'd had to find it. She found a seat and flopped onto it and looked out at the water. This place was breathtaking, the sand, the water and the people. She sat back and did one of the things that she found most interesting, she watched the people, making stories about them in her head. \"Hi.\" Lalita opened her eyes; she'd closed them briefly so that she could feel the sun on her face. Georgie Darcy was smiling down at her. \"Hi.\" Lalita sat up and smiled at the younger girl. \"I hope you don't mind,\" Georgie said, \"but I called Kholi's place and I was told that I could find you here.\" \"No, I don't mind.\" \"I thought you might like a guide to show you LA.\" \"I certainly wouldn't mind,\" Lalita replied smiling at her. \"Great,\" Georgie replied enthusiastically, she'd thought Lalita would think she was intruding. Georgie had heard so much about Lalita from her brother and she wanted to get to know her better. She'd never heard Will talk like that about a girl before, so she knew that Lalita must special. She intended to find out, anyway. \"I thought we might have lunch first,\" Georgie said, \"and then I'd take you to my favourite places in the city.\" Lalita agreed, spending time with Georgie would help her get to know Darcy better. She had such conflicting views about him; on one hand how he'd been in India – so rude and overbearing and how he'd behaved on the plane and the afternoon before when he'd introduced them to his mother and Georgie. Lalita couldn't deny that she was really interested in getting to know Will Darcy much better. XXX Darcy was sitting in the board listening to one of the managers, Browers, make a presentation. He was the head of the European hotels and he was talking about ways to improve of the new services that the Darcy hotels were offering to their clients in France. Darcy couldn't concentrate he kept daydreaming about Lalita. He remembered how surprised and happy he'd been when he'd found her and her family at the airport. His plan of getting to sit next to her during the flight, had worked. He hadn't thought Lalita would allow it but she'd slept peacefully next to him for hours, he knew it was quite creepy but he couldn't resist watching her sleep. They'd talked but he knew that he was still a long way from getting her to think better of him. This was his chance, she was in his city; he decided that he'd call her after work and invite her for dinner or something, he'd show her that he wasn't the insensitive and arrogant person she'd met in India. Finally Brower's presentation came to an end and they broke off for lunch. After lunch he had more meetings and this time his mother was attending. What joy! Darcy's phone vibrated. Taking Lalita to lunch and some sightseeing. See you in the evening. G Darcy read the message twice. Georgie hadn't mentioned that she was going to meet Lalita, to him, this morning. He smiled to himself; he knew where Georgie would be taking Lalita for lunch. He decided to join them. \"Harriet, please tell my mother and that board that I won't be able to make the meeting after lunch,\" he said to his secretary. \"Something has come up.\" Harriet nodded and picked up the phone to relay the message. Something very serious must have come up, Mr. Darcy wasn't one to miss meetings, she thought to herself. XXX Darcy walked into the restaurant, greeted the maitre'd and was led to the table; the girls were just finishing up their meal. Georgie smiled widely at her brother while Lalita's smile was more uncertain. \"I heard that my sister wanted to show you around the town,\" Darcy said smiling at Lalita, \"and I decided that you didn't deserve such a fate, so I've come to rescue you.\" \"I'll have you know that your sister has been very good company,\" Lalita replied, \"better than you.\" \"Really?\" Darcy asked, \"Then I'll have to redeem myself.\" \"Too late,\" Georgie told him, \"Lalita has told me all about your misadventures in India.\" \"Has she really?\" \"Yes,\" Georgie replied, \"how you refused to dance with her. How could you?\" \"But you know I never dance.\" Darcy protested. \"How you said that Indian girls are traditional.\" \"Come on,\" Darcy said, \"are you going to repeat everything I said?\" Georgie and Lalita laughed at his discomfort. \"Enough about me,\" Darcy said, \"what are the plans for this afternoon?\" \"I thought you were in meetings all day,\" Georgie told him. \"Well, not anymore.\" \"Well I've been to the beach,\" Lalita told them. \"So we'll go the Paul Getty museum first,\" Georgie said, \"Will told me you're interested in art. And then we'll go to the Observatory, Madame Tussauds, and the other museums. There's so much to do and see here.\" \"Georgie,\" Darcy said, \"now you sound like a guide book.\" \"I suppose you have a better plan?\" \"First, we'll take her home,\" Darcy said, \"no tour of LA is complete without a visit to the Darcy home and we'll take it from there.\" Brother and sister smiled at each other, Georgie knew then that Will really liked Lalita. He never invited girls home lest they got the wrong idea. \"Let's go then,\" Georgie said, pulling Lalita to her feet, \"I can't wait to show you around the grounds, they're amazing if I say so myself. Will designed them, you know.\" Darcy smiled at Lalita and she smiled back, the three of them walked out of the restaurant. Tomorrow, Darcy thought to himself, tomorrow, he'd get her to spend time with him alone. XXX ","Summary":" Bride and Prejudice doesn't belong to me.

Five!\" Lakhi was not helping matters, standing behind her mother as she exaggerated her tone and actions in her usual copycat manner. \"What must your husband think, hm?\" Mrs Bakshi pressed. \"Your one year anniversary gone and you've yet to bear him a child.\" \"Mama...\" Mrs Bakshi was not the only woman concerned about the lack of grandchildren. Catherine Darcy pinned her son with a pointed look as they sat down to a hurried dinner before Will flew out. \"You've been married for over a year,\" she began imperiously. \"I'm not talking about this with you,\" replied Will firmly, checking his phone before placing it back in his jacket pocket. \"There's nothing else for her to be doing,\" reasoned the matriarch with what she saw as perfect logic, \"so why isn't she giving birth to your child? Your heir to this great empire?\" \"Mother!\" Darcy protested, lowering his voice slightly when the waiter arrived with their dishes. \"Is there something wrong?\" Catherine continued, genuinely concerned as she placed a hand on her son's arm. \"I can give you the name of a specialist.\" Will extracted his arm from hers as he fell back against his chair. \"We're fine,\" he said, his voice firm as he removed the napkin from his lap. \"And now if you will excuse me, I have a flight to catch.\" Catherine Darcy watched with a dropped jaw as her son actually rose and left her alone at the table. Meanwhile, Lalita breathed a sigh of relief when the constant questions and criticisms abated as Jaya arrived. The heavily pregnant woman shared a weary smile with her sister as she rested a hand on her distended belly, Bijili struggling to bring in the large bags. Balraj was right behind his wife. \"I trust we are not late?\" the man asked with a winning smile. \"Of course not!\" cried Mrs Bakshi, rushing over to her son-in-law. She embraced him firmly, eased back and then pulled him in for another hug. \"It has been too long since we saw you last!\" \"And Jaya!\" she cried next, hugging her pregnant daughter. Managing to escape, Balraj exchanged a wry grin with his sister-in-law. \"Darcy here yet?\" Lalita smiled as she embraced her husband's best friend. \"He's on his way.\" Jaya reached for her next and Lalita hugged her sister firmly. Frequent phone calls across continents didn't make up for face-to-face contacts. \"I am so willing to give birth much sooner rather than later,\" Jaya grumbled good-naturedly as they linked arms and made for the dining room. The dinner conversation was in full swing, the upcoming celebrations the biggest talking point, when the phone suddenly rang. Lakhi dashed off before Maya could stop her as the conversation came to a halt. The teenager waltzed back into the room soon after with a gleeful look on her face. \"It's for you Lalita. It's your husband .\" Lalita ignored her sister's behaviour and stood instantly, excusing herself as she left the room and answered the phone. \"Will?\" \"Hey,\" came the swift reply. \"You weren't answering your phone.\" Lalilta brushed her hair from her forehead as she propped herself up against the wall. \"Sorry. Things are a bit hectic here.\" \"So I'm assuming that you haven't told them yet?\" Darcy ventured. Lalita was silent for a moment. \"Ah no. I was waiting for you,\" she added hastily. She smiled when she heard the chuckle in reply. \"Chickened out did you?\" Will said affectionately. Lalita worded her response carefully. \"It was more of a matter of, ah, principle.\" \"Well, if it helps, I didn't tell my Mother today either.\" The conversation continued before Lalita noted the time and grew concerned. \"Where are you?\" \"Waiting to board the plane,\" explained Will. \"Maintenance is delaying our flight, but I'll be there as soon as I can.\" The call finished soon after as both signed off with a \"Love you and see you soon\". Mrs Bakshi's thrill at the birth of her second grandchild six and a half months later was dampened upon discovering that her daughter had given birth to a girl. \"What use are girls to their fathers?\" she muttered to herself as she pottered around the house. \"Fathers want boys.\" Her disappointment was nothing to Mrs Darcy's. \"A girl?\" Catherine queried, her interest barely piqued. \"And her name?\" \"Safiyah,\" explained the elated Will over the phone, the adrenaline fast leaving his system as exhaustion set in. \"Sophia?\" repeated his mother. \"Nice enough. Bit run of the mill, but...\" \"Not Sophia, Mother,\" interrupted the new father. \"Safiyah.\" Catherine Darcy was silent. How very... Indian . Yet another influence of her headstrong daughter-in-law. The conversation finished with the obligatory congratulations and Will hung up the phone call to find himself face to face with the face of his excited sister, what he could see of her that is. (Georgina Darcy had been less than impressed two years ago to find out that she had missed out on her brother's impromptu wedding to Lalita in Amritsar at the same time as Balraj. Fearful of missing the birth of her niece or nephew, she had parked herself at their place for the last three weeks.) \"You right there Georgie?\" laughed Will as he struggled to find her face. \"Did you buy out the gift shop?\" The teenager grinned widely as she pushed some helium balloons off to the side, beyond caring as they bounced right back. \"There can never be enough for my niece!\" Both Darcys made their way down the hall and stepped into the hospital room where Lalita was propped up against the pillows. Georgie dumped the balloons on a table without ceremony and headed for the bassinette where little Safiyah Darcy was sleeping soundly, just fed. Will took a seat on the edge of his wife's bed as he kept a watchful eye on his sister. Content she wasn't going to do anything crazy, he turned to Lalita. He was planning on kissing her, but when he saw her expression, he eased back. \"Is there something wrong?\" he asked in concern. Lalita held up her mobile phone with a groan. \"Brace yourself. My family's coming.\" Finito.

Neither does its inspiration Pride and Prejudice and may I take this moment to say how utterly amazing Jane Austin is for writing it? \"Jaya!\" My mother rushed into the sitting room where I was sitting restlessly, waiting for some kind of news from Lalita or Darcy about Lakhi. I launched myself off the sofa when she came in, thinking Lalita must have found her. \"Is she alright mama?\" I asked desperately, \"Is she coming home?\" \"What are you talking about?\" She asked brusquely as she began fussing over me, flattening my hair and brushing invisible specks of dust from my long peach coloured shirt. I pulled away from her persistent hands to frown at her. \"What are you doing mama?\" My mother dropped her hands with an exaggerated sigh. \"Don't ask stupid questions Jaya!\" she snapped and I blinked at her in bewilderment that was quickly giving way to irritation. She began to try and neaten me up again and I batted her hands away. She released another long-suffering huff, \"Couldn't you have worn something more flattering for seeing Balraj again?\" I froze; my heart stopped for half a beat before picking up again at twice it's normal speed. Hope soared through me for just a moment, I still loved him with everything I had, but them my rational mind shot it down. Balraj didn't love me; if he did he would have kept in touch like he said he would. Whatever he wanted, it certainly wasn't to marry me. \"I don't want to see him Mama.\" I said flatly, trying to ignore the aching in my heart that betrayed my true desire: to see him one last time, consequences be damned. \"Don't be ridiculous Jaya!\" She scolded. \"I know you look terrible but that's no reason not to see him!\" I held myself back from replying for fear that my voice would crack, though I wasn't sure whether it would be from anger at my mother or from despair that Balraj was back. She seemed to take my as assent and bustled towards the door muttering, \"Number one is sorted at last!\" gleefully. \"Mama, wait!\" I cried but she was already gone. I spun round, desperately searching for a way out but the only door was the one my mother had just disappeared through; the one Balraj would be coming through any second. My gaze fell on the window and for a moment I seriously considered it as an option. On the one hand I was acting like a child but on the other, I wanted to be anywhere else but here. I never had to make the decision. \"Jaya.\" his voice was just as rough and beautiful as I remembered it being and the now familiar constricting of my chest was back. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice flat and refusing to turn to face him. It was hard enough right now, I knew if I looked at him I would lose any of the minuscule progress I had made in getting over him. In truth, I was still as much in love with him as I was before, and that scared me: he could break me so easily. \"I'm here for you, Jaya, I'm here to tell you I love you!\" My heart inflated in my chest but I carefully kept it under control, it wasn't that easy, he had some explaining to do. \"If you love me so much, then why did you leave?\" I demanded, still not looking at him. \"I loved you then Jaya and I love you now, but someone that I would trust with my life convinced me I was too blinded by my love for you to see this wasn't what you wanted. They convinced me you were just being pushed into it and you didn't really love me. I couldn't bear to put either of us through a loveless marriage. I shouldn't have listened to them, I know that now and I didn't want to then, but they played on my insecurities. They used my fear that I could never be enough for you to control me and I can never tell you how sorry I am for that. Just know that both of us were trying to do what we thought was best.\" I felt my heart drop. After all that had happened between us it was really that easy to convince him that I didn't really love him? \"Jaya, please, I haven't stopped thinking about you since the moment I left you! I came back despite what other people think and what Will said, because I love you!\" Will. Of course. That must be why Lalita said no to him, I'm not blind, I know she loves him. Brave little Lalita, stubborn little Lalita. I smiled for a moment before I remembered why I was here. I half turned my head towards him so I could just see his figure out of the corner of my eye. \"So instead of thinking 'Jaya has told me before that her mother is very pushy' and remembering all the times that I apologised for her and just simply the way I looked at you and realising that nobody can fake feelings like that, you decided to leave? You just couldn't trust me, could you?\" I asked icily. I knew my mother could probably hear me but honestly I didn't care. It felt like I had been stabbed in the back. Speaking of my back I could feel his eyes on it, but I didn't turn. \"Jaya…\" I saw him make walk towards me and I tensed, he stopped immediately. \"I know what I did was stupid and wrong but it's too late for me now. I can only tell you how completely ashamed I am for what I did, for doubting you, and hope and pray that you'll accept when I ask you to marry me.\" I have to admit, he had me there. The side of me that was good, sweet and kind had already forgiven him, after all, if Lalita had told me he was faking how he felt wouldn't I have trusted her at least a little? The huge part of me that still loved him was jumping up and down for joy that he still loved me and telling me to let go of any resentment I might hold because, despite everything, he came back. But then there was that small part of me that still felt like he had tossed me aside and sneered at my love for him that, after his last comment, would be silent no longer. I finally whirled around, aware of the tears that were shining in my eyes and almost yelled, \"You think you can just come back and pick up where we left off?\" I was startled to find my nose almost touching him and I stumbled backwards a step but he grabbed my hand and pulled me back to him. He stoked my cheek gently and looked at me with an irritatingly perfect mixture of love, hope and sadness in his eyes. \"Of course I don't think that, but I love you, and you love me and in time, I hope I can earn your forgiveness.\" His voice was sincere and I could see no deception in his perfect brown eyes. I could almost taste the electricity that was in the small gap between us and I desperately wanted to close it but that deadly annoying part of me needed one last jab. \"What makes you so sure I'm still in love with you?\" I demanded. Balraj pulled me into him completely and grasped my chin in his hand, \"This.\" He brought his lips down on mine and from the moment they touched them, I was a lost cause. His lips were soft and warm and moved perfectly in synch with mine. His right hand dropped from my chin to join his left, which was already wound tightly around my waist and my hands slid into his hair. It was the best feeling I had ever had. After a long moment, he pulled away and rest his forehead against mine, \"I heard your mother earlier, and for what it's worth you've never looked more beautiful to me.\" My joy rendered me speechless so I pressed my lips against his again, hoping he could feel all the love for him that was currently coursing through my veins. This time he broke away fairly soon and pulled away from me. I was confused for a moment until he sank down to one knee in front of me and pulled out a gold ring with a light purple stone set into it. It didn't escape me that the stone was the exact shade of purple that I once told him was my favourite colour. That day seemed almost a life time ago now and the fact that he remembered it after all this time only made me love him that much more. \"Marry me Jaya, please?\" I could only nod weakly as tears began to run down my cheeks, this time though they were tears of happiness. Balraj took my left hand and gently slid the ring onto my third finger. I vaguely wondered how he knew what ring size he was but then he pressed his lips to every one of my fingers and I found I didn't care anymore. Balraj stood up again and enveloped me in a hug. In that moment, with his arms wrapped around me and my head on his shoulder, knowing that he loved me, knowing we would soon be married and that we would spend forever together, I'd never been so happy. I just read this through and I'm just casually smiling to myself :') It makes me so darn happy :') No offence to Will and Lalita but I will always be in love with Baya far more than Walita.

And he's really keen on buying thatnHotel Resort in Goa, right next to the one we stayed in.\" \"Really? I'll asknBalraj if we can join you guys in India. If he's too busy, I'llngo. So you're okay with Will now buying hotels in India?\" Jayanlaughed. \"Well, I think now,nhe has a better understanding of India and the culture. I'm sonproud of him Jaya, because he's been reading so much about ourncountry. He actually asked me first for my opinion before he took thenideas to his mom and the board of directors? We're so lucky tonmarry the men we married, Jaya.\" \"I couldn't agreenmore.\" \"Oh, Will is herenJaya. I have to go. I'll see you next week, alright. Bye.\" \"Bye, Lalita.\" After hanging up thenphone, Lalita rushed excitedly to meet Will at the door. \"Do you know thatnthis is my favorite part of the day? Coming home and you are waitingnfor me.\" Will said hugging his wife and kissing her lightly on thenlips. \"And I love, morenthan anything greeting you at the door. So how was the meeting?\" \"The meeting wentnwell, it was just too long. I'm starving. I'm sorry, I know thatnit's a bit late.\" \"It's okay. Just gonand sit down and I'll get the food ready.\" \"Thanks, babe, fornwaiting for me. So we are all set for our meeting with the hotelnowner in Goa and also we are meeting with the city mayor and thencontractors in Armistrar. Have you talked to Dad about what we talkednabout?\" \"Nope, I wasn'tnsure if you wanted me to and if it was my place to do so. Plus, Injust thought that it would be better if you asked him yourself andnyou, two men, talked.\" \"Yeah, that'snexactly my thought too. Hey babe, I was thinking, you know hownGeorgina spends a lot of her time with us, and she's really closento you, do you mind, if she wants to, if she moved in with us?\" \"Oh God Will, younknow I love having her around. Plus, we have such a big house and sonmany rooms.\" \"I was also thinking,nI know that Lakhi is graduating from high school and she's going tona university soon, what do you think of her coming here and going tonschool here?\" \"Oh, I'm sure she'dnlove that. But universities here cost more money.\" \"Don't worry aboutnthat babe. I also think it would do Georgina to have a friend she cannhang out with. She and Georgina seem to get along too. They can go tonschool together too.\" \"Let me talk to Mamanand Papa. Lakhi is the baby in the family, you know how Mama is. Butnthank you for thinking of her.\" \"Speaking of babiesnand rooms, I was wondering, if you want to, I mean we don't havento do now but when you're ready, I'd like for us to startnthinking about maybe, starting a family maybe in a year or two.\" \"Really, Will? I'dnlike that. I can wait to see little Wills running around the house.\" \"And I can't waitnto see little Lalitas running around the house and I know for surenthey have me wrapped around their fingers like their Mom. How many donyou want?\" \"Well, the idealnnumber would be two but I think I want to have more than that.\" \"Yeah, me too, I'dnlike to have more than two. I was thinking, we can start after thenhotel in Armistrar is done. I don't want us to travel too much whennyou're pregnant. I, especially want to be here when you need me.\" \"Will, you are toonmuch. Did I ever tell you how lucky I am to be your wife?\" \"You have but I don'tnmind hearing it again.\" \"I love you. Whyndon't you on upstairs and rest. I'll clean up here and I'llnjoin you after I'm done.\" \"Okay. The food, asnalways, was delicious. I'll wait for you in the bedroom. I lovenyou.\" Will kissed Lalitanbefore making his way to the bedroom.[Chapter 2] Part 2 A week later… Will and Lalita arengetting ready to go to the airport to go London. Will loves to watchnhis wife get dressed. She's beautiful in whatever she wears and shenalways seems to leave his breathless. Lalita noticed that Will isnjust watching her and not making any effort to pack. \"Will, if you don'tnstart packing, we are going to be late, babe.\" \"Are you aware hownbeautiful you are?\" Will walked over to his wife and wrapped hisnarms around her. He then kissed her neck and took in her scent. \"And do you know howngood-looking you are, Will Darcy?\" \"What you think of menis the only thing that matters to me. As long as you think I'm goodnlooking and hot, that's all I care about.\" \"You're the onlynman I could ever want, Will. You know, if we don't stop making outnnow, we are definitely not going to get to the airport on time.\"nWill started to undo her top and was working his way to undo the restnas his mouth kiss her collarbone. Lalita was lost in what Will wasndoing to her that packing at this moment was all but forgotten. After their lovemaking,nboth were exhausted but still in a playful mood as Will started tontickle Lalita. Shrieks could be heard in the house and Will couldn'tnhelp but laugh at his wife. \"Will, come on babe,nyou have to finish packing. We only have 20 minutes.\" Lalita got upnfrom the bed and started to pick up the clothes from the floor. Will,nwho was still in bed watched his wife, and again was lost in thought. \"Will, don't looknat me like that. I know what you are thinking and that will have tonwait until we get to London. Babe, come on the sooner we get to thenairport, the sooner I get to eat. I'm hungry.\" Lalita said whilenpouting. \"All right, you knownI can't refuse you when you look at me like that. I'm almost donenpacking anyways. I'm sure we are going to be doing some shopping innLondon. Hey babe, I almost forgot to ask you, isn't your parents'n30th anniversary coming up?\" \"Yeah, it is. With sonmuch going on, I can't believe you remembered?\" \"Actually, I'venbeen thinking about it for awhile, you know what we could give themnfor their anniversary.\" \"You have? What donyou have in mind?\" \"Actually, Balraj andnI were talking about it. We are thinking that you and your sistersncan plan and arrange a party, but he and I will take care of thenexpenses. It could either be a big party or if you ladies wantnsomething more intimate, that would be fine too. And as for our gift,ntell me if it's a good idea, I'd like to have your parents housenin India renovated. We can add some rooms too for the futurengrandchildren. What do you think?\" Lalita, with tears innher eyes, ran to Will and hugged him really tight. \"Does this mean younlike it?\" \"Will, I love it. Younknow what I love most about you, is how much you love my family.\" \"I do love yournfamily Lalita because I know how much you love them.\" \"Oh Will, Mama willnbe so happy.\" \"I think we can startnrenovation soon that way the house can be ready for the party. Let'sntalk to your father first and see what he says.\" \"I'm sure Papa willnlove it. Thank you, Will.\" \"You don't have tonthank me, babe. Your parents are now my parents too. Come on, wenbetter get going.\" Will took her bag and they made their way to thencar, where the driver was waiting for them. 12 hours later… Will and Lalita arrivednat the London International Airport and waited another hour to clearncustoms. Once they clear customs, both Balraj and Jaya were waitingnfor them outside. Balraj walked over to Will and Lalita and took thenbags from them. Jaya and Lalita hugged each other excitedly. \"Darcy, Lalita it'snso nice to see you guys again. So how was the flight?\" \"The flight was comfynBal not a lot of turbulence.\" \"Jaya told me thatnyou guys are going to India after?\" \"Yeah, I thought it'dnbe a good idea to see Mom & Dad and the two girls. Plus, I neednto see the site where we plan to build the new hotel Will you guys benable to go with us?\" \"Well, Jaya will gonfirst and then I'll join you guys later. We have some cases that wenare finishing up so I can't leave yet.\" \"Ok. We'll be innIndia for two weeks, so hopefully, these cases you're working onnwill close before then. Where's Kiran?\" \"Oh, Kiran she'snmeeting us for dinner later.\" \"Is she still datingnthat guy, David?\" \"Yeah, she is. Inthink ever since Darcy and I got married, she's been anxious tonsettle down herself. Can you imagine, my sister a wife? He's a nicenlad. My parents like him.\" \"Good for Kiran. It'snabout time she starts dating seriously.\" \"So what do you havenin store for us, Bal?\" \"Well, I'm surenthee two will go shopping and gossip. I know you're in a meetingnthe whole day tomorrow and the day after, then you guys are leavingnthe next day after that. Let's go home first and talk. Thenntonight, we are having dinner with my parents and Kiran.\"[Chapter 3] Part 3 The next threendays went by fast. Jaya and Lalita spent most of their time catchingnup and shopping. While, Will went to his business meetings and Balrajnworked on the cases his law firm is handling. Balraj felt bad thatnthey were not able to spend some time in London but he promised tonjoin them later in India and make up for it. They are now atnthe airport, waiting for their flight to India. After an hour, theynfinally boarded the plane. Theynarrived at the airport in the afternoon. Six months ago, as ansurprised birthday gift for their, Lalita and Jaya bought theirnparents an SUV. They knew that their parents always wanted to own anvehicle and also, it would come in handy when they pick them up atnthe airport. After clearing customs, they spotted their Dad, Lakhinand Maya, already waiting for them outside. As soon as they werenseen, Lakhi and Maya ran to Will nearly knocking him down to thenground. \"Whoah,neasy there girls.\" \"Oh Will,nwe've missed you so much.\" Lakhi said. \"Only, Will? \" \"Of course wenmissed you two, don't be silly.\" \"Come on, Papanis waiting in the car.\" Lakhi and Maya took the bags from Will. \"Mom's beenncooking all morning. She's been yelling at me and Maya and sayingnthat we are not helping her.\" \"That'snbecause you girls weren't helping, I bet. Hello Will. Jaya, Lalita.nHow was your flight?\" Mr. Bakshi greeted them. \"Hello Dad.nThe flight was good. We took a nap on the plane. These two ladiesnhave been talking non-stop.\" \"Where isnBalraj?\" \"Oh, Papa hencouldn't come with us on this flight but he promised he willnfollow. He'll be here next week\" \"Comenon, we better get going. You Mama has been anxiously waiting for yournarrival. She's been talking our ears off for the past week. Justnbear with her when she starts talking about grandkids.\" \"We're usednto it, Papa.\" \"So Will,nLalita tells me that you're building a new hotel here in Amritsar.\" \"Yes, Sir.nActually, Sir I was wondering if you don't mind if I could invitenyou to dinner tomorrow night?\" \"Will,nremember I told you to call me Dad and not Sir. So will it just benthe two of us?\" \"Yes, and wencan have drinks after.\" \"Itnsounds serious. But sure, why not, it'd be good for the ladies toncatch up.\" \"I just wantednto talk to you and go over some things.\" \"Allnright. Oh, here we are. Your mother is already waiting for us.\" Mrs.nBakshi couldn't hide her excitement as soon as she saw her sonnin-law and her two married daughters. Although she talked to themnevery week, she missed having them around the house. She's so proudnof what they have become and the men that they married. It's funny,nshe thought, a little over a year ago, she was worried that her twoneldest daughters would never find anybody to marry. It was knownnaround town how picky they were and it didn't help that their dadnalways sided with them. Her husband loved their four daughters and henwanted them to make their own decisions when it came to marriage.nLalita, the most outspoken one, found herself a wonderful Americannguy, who has become like a son to her as well as Balraj. She nevernpictured any of her daughters marrying a foreigner but Will isneverything she could ever want in a son in law. Its funny how Balrajnand Will, best friends ended up with Jaya and Lalita, who are alsonbest friends. \"Oh, Will,nit's so nice to see you again. You look like you are losing weightnWill. Is my daughter not feeding you enough?\" Mrs. Bakshi hugsnWill. \"Hi Mom, hownare you? Lalita feeds me well. I've just been so busy at work.\" \"HinMama.\" Lalita and Jaya both said hugging their mother. \"Work,nwork, work. When will I see little Wills running around?\" \"Mama. Willnand I are enjoying are time together. We've already talked aboutnwhen we will start planning for kids, right honey?\" \"Yes, honey.nSo Mom, don't you worry, kids are in our plans. I told Lalita thatnI would like to have three or maybe four kids.\" \"Really, Will?nI'm so happy to hear that. Come and let's go in the dining room.nI have lunch waiting. We have the rooms all ready for you and we justnput in new air conditioners.\" \"Thanks Mama.\"nLalita said. After lunch,nWill suggested to Lalita that she and her sisters talk about thenparty for their parents while he goes to the farm with her Dad, so hencould spend some time with him. Will enjoys talking to Lalita'snfather and hearing his stories about Lalita and the girls growing up.nThere's so much of him in Lalita and their closeness reflects innhow different he interacts with Lalita than his other daughters. It'snbecause Lalita was the one that helped their father in the farm. Henadmires how he's able to raise four girls, and give them educationnand instill respect, love and values. When Will lost his father, henalso lost a friend and someone he could talk to. Although his fathernwas a businessman, he cared and deeply loved him and Georgie. Henmisses his father and he's so happy that Lalita's father hasntreated him like his own son. Since he asked Lalita's parents fornher hand, they have made him feel like part of the family. Andnthere's nothing he wouldn't do for her family. Meanwhile, backnin the house, Lalita, Lakhi, Maya, and Jaya are talking in the guestnroom. They waited until their Mama had fallen asleep to take a nap.nThey wanted to make sure they have everything down, before they tellntheir parents about a party they are planning for them. \"Maya, Lakhinwe need to talk but first, Jaya and I got you both girls somethingnfrom London.\" Lalita handednmatching purses for Lakhi and Maya. \"Oh my GodnJaya, Lalita, how did you know?\" Lakhi gave both Lalita and Jaya anhug. \"Well, we havenheard you enough times about wanting a new purse, Lakhi so we gotnMaya one too. Do you like it Maya?\" \"Of course Indo, but isn't this expensive. It's Burberry, right? You know youndidn't have to get me anything.\" \"Maya, don'tnworry about it. We only get to see you girls, twice a year andnbesides, I know that Papa and Mama have been depending on you morensince Jaya and I got married. You deserve an expensive gift, Maya.nAnd also you look out for Lakhi. Lakhi, you better be behaving.\" \"I am, Lalita.nI promised you that no boys until after I'm done with college.\" \"Speaking ofncollege, you're graduating soon right? Do you know what you'rengoing to major in Lakhi?\" \"I haven'tnmade up my mind yet. I'm thinking maybe, Architecture ornEngineering or Fashion Design.\" \"You betternfigure it fast Lakhi.\" \"I willnLalita. So, I know we're not in this room to talk about college.\" \"Well, younboth know that Mama and Papa's 30th Anniversary is coming upnright?\" \"Yeah, it'snin three months.\" \"Well, Lalitanand I and our wonderful and sweet hubbies, want to throw them anparty. But we need you and Maya, to make all the arrangements here.nWhat we will do, while we are here is tell you how we want the housendecorated. We'll ask Mama and Papa who they want to invite. We willnhire caterers and also party planner, to make things easier for younboth. We both know that you're busy with school.\" \"Oh this isnexciting. Mama and Papa will be so happy.\" \"After we talknto Mama and Papa, we can start with the invitations. The ones here innIndia, you guys take care of sending them out. Jaya and I will be inncharge of the ones in the US and the UK. Let's talk to them atndinner tonight.\" \"How about wenstart coming up with designs for the invitations?\" Lakhi suggested. \"Then whatevernwe come up with, we can vote and see which one we like the best.\"nMaya said. \"All right.nLet's start now.\" It was almostntime for dinner by the time Will and Mr. Bakshi got back to thenhouse. Mrs. Barshi'snvoice could be heard from the gate. \"Lalita, wherenis Will? Why did you let your Papa take him to the farm? Now he'sngoing to smell like the farm. That good looking husband of yours, Indon't see how he enjoys going there with your Papa?\" \"Mama, Willnloves spending time with Papa. He loves helping him out at the farm.nYou know, Papa is like a father to him.\" \"I know Lalitanbut he should be resting. You guys had a long flight.\" \"Oh,nMama Will is so used to travelling, I don't think he gets jetlaggednanymore.\" \"Oh, here theynare. You two men, I don't know how you could spend the wholenafternoon at the farm. You both better shower and change, dinner willnbe ready soon.\" \"Will, go getnin the shower, I'll have your clothes ready for you.\" Will walked tonLalita and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \"You don'tnhave to do that, honey. Just stay here with Mom and help her.\" \"No, it'snokay Will, Jaya is here. Go and have your shower.\" \"Thanks Mom.nCome on, babe.\" Will and Lalitanleft the kitchen holding hands. After an hour,nthe table is set and all are seated at the dining table. \"Mama, Papa wenknow that your 30th wedding anniversary is coming up and we wanted tongive you a party, to celebrate 30 wonderful and happy years.\" \"Really? Butnisn't that going to cost a lot of money, Lalita?\" Mrs. Bakshinasked. \"Your mothernis right, it will cost a lot of money. We can just have a privatendinner, just us family.\" BothnJaya and Lalita look at Will and nodded for him to say something. Mom, Dad, onnbehalf of Balraj and your four daughters, we wanted to give you thisnparty as our gift. Don't worry about the cost.\" \"Oh, Will, mynson, this is too much. But maybe, if Mrs. Bakshi won't mind, we cannlimit our list to just close friends and relatives. Is that okay withnyou, Mrs. Bakshi?\" \"Of course,nMr. Bakshi.\" \"Mama, Papa,nhow about you give us a list and then we will start working on theninvitations. We only have three months. And those coming from the UKnand the US, can ask for vacations ahead of time.\" \"How about youngive us a day or two to come up with the list? Would it be all right,nif we also celebrate Lakhi's graduation?\" \"Really,nMama? But my graduation is not a big deal, Mama. We can just have anquiet dinner for that. Your 30th anniversary is a momentous occasion.nYou and Papa deserve to have the spotlight for once.\" \"Thank younLakhi.\" \"Mama, papa,nhave you seen what Jaya and Lalita got for me and Maya?\" \"No, what didnyour sisters get you?\" They gave usnBurberry purses. Our friends are going to be so jealous.\"\" \"Don't youngirls think those purses are too expensive for them?\" \"Mama, it'snonly one time.\" \"It betternjust be this once. Lakhi, Maya I don't want you bringing thesenpurses to school, you hear.\" Mrs. Bakshi ordered. \"We won'tnMama, we promised.\" \"Mama, aboutnthe party, if you and Papa want to renew your vows, I think thatnwould be nice. We can get the same pandit, who married you and Papan30 years ago, to make it even more special. But we can change it up anlittle by each writing your own vow. What do you think, Mama, Papa?\"nLalita asked. \"Really? Younfather and I will talk about it and we will let you know.\" Will looked atnLalita and smiled. He took her hand and leaned in to whisper \"Thatnwas a great idea, babe.\" Lalita smiled back and mouthed a softn\"Thank you.\" After dinner,nJaya and Lalita offered to help clean up. But Mrs. Bakrshi told themnto go to their rooms and rest. She said that she, and their twonyounger sisters and Vasily would take care of cleaning up. Jaya,nLalita and Will said their good nights. Before going tonbed, Jaya called Balraj and told him the good news about the party.nBalraj updated her on the case he's working on and told her that henwished he were there in India with her. Jaya said she misses him too.nThey talked for another half hour before finally hanging up. Will and Lalitanare in their room talking. Will told her about the afternoon he spentnwith her father at the farm. And how he's looking forward to havingndinner and drinks with him tomorrow. He said he's still a bitnnervous about asking him to be the project manager for the hotel innAmritsar. Lalita assured him that it will be fine and to just asknhim. They have to go to the city tomorrow morning and inspect thensite. Will pulled his wife closer and kissed her good night.

Neither they nor the plot are in any way a reflection of or in connection to any of the real people the film is based on. \"You're un-bloody-believable, ye know that?\" Mark Ashton turned to Mike Jackson, flashing him a sly smirk and a wink. \"And don't you forget it.\" Mike rolled his eyes at his best friend's default smugness, still riding the adrenaline high of everything that had happened today. June 29th, 1985. It was certainly a day neither would ever forget. The last fourteen hours had been charged with jubilation and the night's festivities had been no different. It was infectious. Neither man could control their matching grins as they stood together outside Gay's The Word. Taking off his beanie, the Acrington-native ran a hand through his hair, unable to keep the amused beam off his face, even as he tried to argue: \"Seriously, Mark. Ye can't just…Bromley is–\" \"Bromley, or Joe, as he made bloody sure I knew, is a big boy, Mike. He'll be fine. I'll be gentle. Start with something simple like the dos and don'ts of Drag, or somethin'. Don't mother him,\" the Irishman interrupted him with a dismissive wave, lighting a cigarette and inhaling deeply. Mike swallowed, a lump forming in his throat as he watched his friend, before shaking his head, trying to not give in to feelings that were always lying not-so-dormant under his skin. \"And besides,\" Mark quipped, turning on the spot to face his him, \"he seemed to do fine under your tutelage. You kept up his education,\" he finished, passing the cigarette to Mike with a quirk of his eyebrow. Mike shrugged, taking a drag. \"He…he had questions,\" he shrugged, \"I…did my best.\" Mark leaned in to him, their shoulders touching softly. \"You did great, Mike. Bromley was lucky to have you. And Steph and Jeff and the rest of the group…\" he trailed off, staring ahead, out into the street in front of Gay's The Word. A weight descended on them as the silence stretched on. It hung between them, tethering them together, tying them up in knots until they were so entwined that it was hard to spot where Mark finished and Mike began. Attached at the hip, figuratively and close-to-literally. Just like old times… It made Mike's stomach clench uncomfortably, Mark's angered words still echoing in his ears: Do you think that just for once, you could stop following me around like a fucking spaniel and let me have a life of my own?! He couldn't allow himself to fall back into bad habits. Mark may have apologised for being a prick about it, but it didn't mean that he didn't have a point. Mike had been entangling his life too much with the Irishman's, their time apart only proved that. The bespectacled man had been at a loss when his best friend left, feeling adrift and aimless for a long time. It was an ache that just grew larger and larger in his chest with every passing day. It went beyond missing him. It was a feeling of not only loneliness, but of confusion. Just who was he without Mark and the cause and a plan to follow? He didn't think he'd ever find out. Would ever have to… Until one day, Joe came to him with a question, an awkward attempt at seeking advice, really. And the rest…was history. And it happened without Mark. Without his warmth and his smile and his own brand of crazy. It was something that was just Mike's that he chose to share with Joe and Jeff and anyone else who needed it. He was no expert, but he was a good listener and had enough experience to help out his younger friends with their love lives and other troubles. He became a confidant, the person they all turned to in times of crisis, of worry, of jubilation. And it felt good. But not as good as Mark standing beside him, shoulder brushing his, his dark eyes twinkling as he stared up at the night sky. Mike foolishly thought he could have both. The person he had found within himself, the same quiet and composed man but now with a little more confidence, a little more direction, and have Mark back, at his side, with his tenacity and ingenuity and rapier wit. But it wasn't to be. As soon as he had heard that Bromley's \"education\" had been somehow continued in his absence, he had swooped in and appointed himself his new teacher. \"\"I expect an apple on my desk every morning because after all, Brom—Joe,\" he had winked, gesturing with his can, \"nobody has more experience than I do.\" Well, he did have Mike there, he supposed. So things were to go back to the way they were before. The same old Mark and the same old Mike. Six months ago, he would have given anything for that to happen. Now, he wasn't so sure… \"Steph and Jeff,\" Mark huffed out a laugh suddenly, interrupting Mike's spiralling thoughts, a puff of air rising from his lips, his shoulders hunching as he shoved his hands into his pockets, \"sounds like some weird double act.\" \"Move over Morecambe and Wise,\" Mike joked, forcing his tone to sound as normal as possible before taking another drag of the cigarette and holding it out. Mark reached out, his less-than-sober hand bumping against his friend's, their fingers brushing as he took the smoke and brought it to his lips. Mike couldn't help but stare as a familiar warmth pooled in his stomach at his touch. \"You helped him, Mike,\" he murmured so lowly that the bespectacled man had to lean further into him to hear what he was saying, \"you were…you were there for him, for everyone when I—\" he broke off, shaking his head, swaying a little, \"you're important, Mike. More than…more than you know,\" he paused, his Adam's apple bobbing in his throat. Mike found his own tightening with emotion, it swelling in his chest at the Irishman's words. Mark was rarely ever this…sincere. Not about him. \"You're it, you know,\" his best friend continued, his tone turning wistful as his gaze returned to the night's sky, \"you're the…heart of the group. Without you…\" he trailed off, biting his lower lip, clearly struggling with his words. Mike didn't think he'd ever seen him grapple with his words before. His heart hammered in his chest, hardly believing what he was hearing, what Mark was struggling to say. It was like his friend had read his mind and wanted to sooth his worries. Mark was definitely drunk. Mike wasn't far behind him. Turning, the shorter man stared up into his face, his chocolate eyes finally catching his, the cigarette held between them, a little dot of light in the otherwise dark street as he whispered, \"this group needs you, Mike…I need you.\" ","Summary":" Educating Bromley By Cortexikid Chapter 1: Prologue - An Apple For Teacher Disclaimer: This is a fi"},{"Movie":"Pride, 2014","Title":"Flour Power","Author":"AvengersBarnes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13038966","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I wrote this about 3 years ago now. It's on Ao3 but I wanted to share it on here as well. It's basically Marmike fluff. I really miss these characters and this film. Hope you enjoy! Mike was sat at his desk in the apartment he shared with Mark. He was sorting a variety of coins and bank notes into piles so he could count it all. It was long and tiring work but Mike didn't mind. It just meant that the fundraising was a success. The longer it took him to sort and count, the longer their friends in Dulais could afford to strike. He sighed to himself. What I wouldn't give for a cup of tea… He thought. He threw the last few pennies into their container and went downstairs to put the kettle on. Mark was busy sketching up a design for their banner for this year's march. Mike looked lovingly at his mad boyfriend. There was an array of different coloured crayons and scraps of paper scattered all over the carpet. 'What do you think?' Mark held up the design and grinned at his partner. Mike chuckled to himself. Mark was like a child asking for his parent's approval. The design was based on their group name. 'Lesbians & Gays' was at the top in a dark red ink and beneath it was 'Support the Miners'. That was written in black; bigger than the red writing. It was typical of Mark; highlighting others problems before their own. Mark had drawn boxes around the outside of the design, outlined in red, black and yellow; the miners colours. 'It's not quite finished yet though. I need to fill in the boxes.' Mark's eyes were lit up in excitement. 'It's perfect' Mike leaned down to kiss his lover. 'My very talented boyfriend.' Mike started to pull away so he could quickly put the kettle on but Mark refused to let him go. Mike felt Mark's tongue brush against his lower lip as the kiss deepened. Mike sighed into the kiss and parted his lips. He felt his cheeks flush warm as his tongue danced with Mark's in a perfect synchronisation. He felt Mark's hands go up the back of his shirt and he shuddered at the unexpected contact. 'Mark' he whispered hoarsely and reluctantly pulled back to catch his breath. He looked down at his lover in awe. Mark's hair was now a complete mess and Mike loved it. 'You're so handsome' 'And you're so sexy' Mark said with a wink. 'Let's take a break from the work eh?' Mike inhaled deeply as Mark kissed his neck seductively. It was hard to resist his boyfriend's advances but he knew they had too much to do before they could relax. 'Later. I promise' He kissed Mark deeply once more before finally making it to the kitchen. As the kettle was boiling he closed his eyes and attempted to regulate his breathing. God I'm in too deep with this one. He thought to himself with a sigh. The crazy Irishman would honestly be the death of him. 'Do you want tea love?' He called into the living room. 'Er I think we're out of milk? I finished the last of it this morning with breakfast' Mark called back sheepishly. Mike felt his heart drop slightly. Damn it! He cursed internally. 'Why didn't you say something about it then?' He snapped. He knew he was being unreasonable but he had really been looking forward to that tea. Mark looked up at him with his deep brown eyes. 'I'm sorry love' Mark pouted up at him. Mike sighed and embraced his lover; kissing him on the forehead. He couldn't resist Mark's puppy eyes and his boyfriend knew it. 'Just run out and get some yeah?' Mike replied softly as he ran his fingers through his lover's dark locks. 'Of course love. I'll be back as soon as I can.' Mark reached up and kissed him quickly on the lips before running out the house, coat in hand. Mike traced his lips with his fingers and smiled to himself before returning upstairs to finish counting the money from the LGSM collections. Mark had a million thoughts running through his head as he made his way to the shop. This wasn't unusual for him; he often had at least ten ideas in his head about LGSM. He felt guilty for not letting Mike know about the milk. Mark knew how grouchy Mike could get if he was denied a good cup of tea especially after a long day's work. He slipped inside the shop and began looking for the milk aisle. He passed the bread, the eggs, the fresh veg and fruit. God Damn it where's the bloody milk? He thought in exasperation. He looked around at the shelves; flour, baking powder, tubes of different coloured icing. He picked up a pack of the icing. The colours were organised in the order of a rainbow. Gay Pride icing. He chuckled to himself. 'Hefina would love these' He murmured to no one in particular. The idea struck him like a bolt of lightning. LGSM were going to hold a cake sale! He ran back to the front of the shop to get a trolley. Once he was back at the bakery section he proceeded to throw items into the cart; flour, eggs, baking powder, sugar, icing, food colouring, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, mint extract, lemon juice, chocolate chips, cooking chocolate. He raced through the shop trying to find the remaining ingredients; butter and finally the damn milk. He handed over wad of cash, a weeks' worth of tips gone in one go, and sprinted back home to Mike. He fumbled with the keys in the lock in his excitement. Finally the lock gave way and he practically fell into the house. 'Mike!' he shouted upstairs to the lover. He dumped the shopping bags on the kitchen table and scrambled up the stairs; narrowly avoiding trampling on his banner design. 'Mike! I've got a brilliant idea!' He burst into their bedroom to find his boyfriend asleep at the desk. He stopped for a moment and smiled softly at his dozing lover. He crept quietly up to him and started to rub his shoulders. He grimaced as he felt how tight Mike's muscles were. He began to massage Mike's shoulders, circling his fingers around the knots trying to relieve the tension. Slowly he felt his boyfriend begin to stir as he applied slightly more pressure. 'Hmm… Mark?' He heard a voice murmur groggily. 'That you?' Mark smiled. He loved how adorable Mike was when he was just waking up. 'Mhmm.' He leaned down and kissed Mike's neck. 'I love you.' 'Love you too. You crazy Irishman…' Mark chuckled at the nickname and kissed the back of Mike's head. He still couldn't believe that he had found someone who loved him and that he loved back in return. He had never thought for one second that he would be the type to settle down. Yet here he was and with an Englishman of all people! He draped his arms round his boyfriend's neck and rested his head on Mike's. He paused for a moment to enjoy the moment. 'Now… wakey wakey sleepy head. I've got a brilliant idea for LGSM and I need your help!' Mark suddenly remembered his plan and his excitement was renewed. Mike turned round to look at his lover. His eyes were still heavy with sleep, his beany hat was half covering one eye and his glasses were crooked. Mark almost wanted to grab a camera so he could take a picture of how damned adorable his boyfriend was. Where's Bromley when you need him? 'Just give me ten minutes and I'll be downstairs. Yeah?' Mike mumbled sleepily. Mark leant down to place a chaste kiss on Mike's irresistible lips then gently straightened his glasses and hat. 'Of course love.' The pair smiled tenderly at each other for a few moments before Mark ran back downstairs. He pulled a cookery book from the shelf in the lounge and had a quick flip through. At least I managed to remember the right ingredients. He grinned to himself. He turned the oven on to preheat like the recipe suggested and began to gather the ingredients. Mike rubbed his eyes and looked in the mirror. How long was I asleep? He thought to himself. His eyes looked puffy and he had the imprint of his notebook on the side of his face. He splashed some water on his face to wake himself up and repositioned his glasses. He wondered whether Mark had actually gotten the milk in the end or whether he had just gotten distracted by this new idea of his. Mike shook his head in despair at his boyfriend. That boy's mind was too amazing for its own good. Mark couldn't focus on anything for more than ten minutes before his mind ran off on some brilliant and inspiring tangent. Mike did his best to keep up with the whirlwind of Mark Ashton but he could never predict what they would be doing next. One minute they were venting their frustration at Thatcher and the next they were in South Wales. Whilst he was pondering over the rollercoaster of his life since Mark had entered it, he heard a loud crash from downstairs. 'Oh for Fuck's sake!' A shout swiftly followed. Mike ran downstairs; taking the steps two at a time before leaping to the ground. 'Mark!' He shouted into the kitchen. 'Are you alright?' He span round the corner and was confronted by what seemed to be a flour bomb with a very floury Mark sat in the middle. 'One of the eggs fell on the floor when I was trying to crack it into the bowl and I slipped on it and dropped the sieve with the flour!' Mark spluttered out. After seeing that his boyfriend was unharmed Mike couldn't help but burst into hysterical laughter. 'I think you got a bit down you love.' Mike managed to get out in between fits of giggles. 'Oh fuck off!' Mark snapped and pouted up at him. 'It's in your hair and everything!' Mike chortled. 'Oh that is it! You'll regret messing with the hair Mister I'm-so-perfect!' Mark grabbed the mixing bowl and threw the contents all over Mike. Mike coughed and spluttered as he was engulfed in a floury cloud. 'You'll pay for that Ashton!' Mike charged at his boyfriend; grabbing the eggs off the counter. He managed to pin the Irishman down on the floor before cracking an egg right on top of his head. He could feel Mark squirming underneath him and he laughed. He began to rub the egg into his boyfriend's precious dark locks. 'Get off you bastard!' Mark snapped and finally managed to push Mike away. Mike laughed as he watched Mark desperately try and get the egg out of his hair. He scooped up some flour from the floor and chucked it over Mark to finish the effect. The flour of course stuck instantly to the egg and Mark was fuming. He grabbed a bottle of blue food colouring from and cracked the lid open. 'Mark…' Mike said cautiously 'Don't do that.' The tables had suddenly turned and Mike felt very worried. He knew how long the dye could take to wash out. 'Not laughing any more are we Accrington?' Mark let out an deep evil laugh and Mike leapt to his feet in an attempt to escape his mad boyfriend. He ran round to the other side of the kitchen table. 'Seriously Mark. That stuff takes weeks to wash off!' He pleaded and hoped that even if Mark threw the bottle that it wouldn't reached him over the table. 'I warned you not to mess with my hair.' Mark gave him a sinister smile and winked at his lover. The began a dangerous dance around the table; taunting each other with colouring and egg bombs. 'You covered me in cake batter! I'll be brushing sugar out my hair for days!' Mike cried. The adrenaline was pumping through his veins as he span around the table; his eyes never leaving Mark's dark ones. 'You laughed at me!' Mark retorted. Suddenly Mark vaulted over the table and landed on top of him. Mike felt the blue colouring drip down off his hair as Mark emptied the navy blue contents over his head. 'You're a bastard. You know that right?' Mike laughed in spite of himself. He couldn't remember the last time he had laughed so much. 'Yeah. But I'm your bastard.' Mark replied softly and kissed him tenderly on the lips. 'You got something in your hair by the way.' Mark said with a wink. 'Fuck off' Mike responded with grin and pulled his lover down into a deep kiss. And that's a wrap. Hope you enjoyed it! Reviews are always lovely.

'Can we turn this off, please, I've got the books to do?' 'Sorry.' Jonathan turns down the sound on the TV. 'There, don't really need the music, I just want to see the moves...' Gethin sighs, suddenly ashamed of his shortness of temper, his jealousy of a man who isn't that good looking anyway but who seems to have all Jonathan's eyes on him. He turns the volume back up. 'I'll be in the back room with the accounts,' he says. 'Enjoy.' 'Gethin...' Jonathan bounds up from the sofa, drapes his arms over Gethin's shoulders, effectively keeping him in the sitting room. 'It's not, you know, him. Not Travolta, I'm not lusting after a bloke on telly...' 'Didn't think you were, actually.' Jonathan is a substantial presence, holding on, breath sweet and smoky on Gethin's neck. 'Go back to your film, it's only got another, what, an hour to go...' 'It's the dancing, Gethin, the moves; I just want to learn how he does it, how he manages to look so sinuous... I'd love to be able to do it like that, I love it...' 'You love dancing, all the Disco stuff, yeah, I know.' And Gethin hugs his boyfriend tightly, wondering how can he not see, not know...? 'You are sinuous, you, the way you move. Watch you for hours, I could. Beautiful.' 'Now, you're just saying that...' 'Because it's true.' Gethin abandons all thoughts of the books, finds the whisky, the glasses, sits down on the sofa and pats the seat next to him. 'Come on, then. Watch it with me, tell me, what you think he's got that you haven't? What is it about him doing that thing with his hands linked together that's different from you?' 'He's quicker.' 'You're smoother.' 'And... and there, see that thing he does?' 'Down on his knees and up again? Looks painful. Besides, you'll never have room to do that down at Ruroo's...' Jonathan laughed. 'And there was me thought you loved it when I got on my knees...' 'Yes, but no need to pop your kneecaps out for me. And if you bobbed up like that, might do me an injury...' 'And there, look, look! Those hips!' 'Nothing to them, nothing to get hold of, not that anyone'd want to, God, no...' Jonathan turns towards him, whisky still wet on his lips. 'No?' 'No.' Somehow, Gethin manages to make it sound like an invitation, because Jonathan smiles his heart-stopping smile. 'Mind, I'd like to hold you while you moved like that.' 'Really?' 'Maybe. If you liked. After the film, of course.' 'Of course. Well, it's mostly talking now, I think. Only a couple of dances left.' Jonathan leans in, smiles. 'How about, you, me, the whisky, upstairs now? See if I can get my hips going for you. Just for you?' Gethin smiles back and kisses the corner of Jonathan's mouth, just how he likes. 'Sounds like a plan,' he says.

Neither they nor the plot are in any way a reflection of or in connection to any of the real people the film is based on. \"How long have you known?\" \"Mike—\" \"How long?\" his best friend cut across him, a steel edge to his tone that Mark had never heard before as he dragged a hand down his weary face. Mark bit his lip, dark eyes glistening in the dim light of the lamp posts. The street outside Gay's The Word was starting to quieten down after the boisterous energy that the successful Pride march (featuring a significant amount of Welsh miners as well as their LGSM group) had caused. \"A while…\" Mark forced himself to murmur, shoving his hands in his pockets, trying and failing to catch his eye. Mike let out a sudden laugh, yet it held none of his usual mirth, instead it was steeped with an intense hollowness as he struggled with shaking hands to light his cigarette. As that awful sound rang in his ears, Mark felt compelled to make him understand, to explain, the words tumbling from his lips. \"You know me better than anyone, Mike. You know I'm no good. Not for anyone. Especially you…you deserve better. I couldn't—\" \"So this is you puttin' me outta my misery then, eh? Takin' me out back and puttin' me down like Old Yeller? Like the spaniel I am?\" Mike spat bitterly, bleary eyed and swaying dangerously, lit cigarette cradled in his fingers. \"Old Yeller was a mastador,\" the Irishman responded before he could stop himself. There was a beat of silence where Mike finally raised his head to catch his eye. The air was knocked from Mark's lungs at the look on his face. It was one of pain, anger, but worst of all…resignation. As if he never expected this to go any other way. Knowing that he was the one that put it on that face, the same face that was usually so open, caring and gracious, even when Mark was being his most difficult…a sharp pain panged in his chest. \"You better get back in there. Everyone will be wonderin' where ye are…\" Mike muttered, his voice tinged with dejection as he pushed against the wall, propelling himself forward, stumbling past him and down the street. \"Where are you goin'? Mike? Mike!\" Mark yelled after him, his pulse racing his veins, his heart hammering against his rib cage. A sinking sensation swooped in his stomach as he watched his best friend retreat into the darkness, flicking the cigarette away from him, it landing in the middle of the road, the embers struggling to remain aglow until finally they were extinguished, the last of the smoke rising into the night air… A chorus of cheering and laughter from inside the shop erupted, startling Mark as he stared at it. As if on autopilot, his legs carried him several feet towards it, his stomach twisting uncomfortably. Taking his hands out of his pockets, he bent down to pick it up, rolling it between his fingers, the ash falling onto his palm as a weight descended on him, seeping into his bones. It was then, right there as he stood alone in the middle of the road, his best friend long gone from his sight, that it occurred to him. That was the first time in a long while that Mike hadn't shared his cigarette with him… A/N: I wrote this in between writing my behemoth of a Marmike fic.

But I never posted it on this site. There are a few shorter drabbles for P ride on my Ao3 account and I have a lot a smaller posts for Pride under my Pride writing tag on tumblr. I just rediscovered this piece and wanted to share it. I loved this fandom so much and it really helped me become the writer I am today so even though the fandom died a little. This film and these characters are very special to me. So I hope you enjoy this! The sunlight was just beginning to stream through the gap in the curtains as Gethin first awoke. He blinked couple of times to clear the sleep from his eyes and his gaze fell softly upon the figure of his lover. Gethin smiled to himself and closed his eyes once more; enjoying the warmth of their embrace. Another year gone. He thought to himself. Another year survived. He knew he would love Jonathan for as long as they both lived but he had never expected to have so much time with his love. He smiled again; thankful for the extra time they had been blessed with. Gethin kissed Jonathan's chest gently; wanting to prolong the blissful moment. His body, however, had other ideas. A low growl came from his stomach as a reminder that he needed food to live and not just love. His body began to wake up and thus needed to be dealt with; first stop the bathroom, then the kitchen. Gethin untangled himself from Jonathan's long limbs and hulled himself out of bed. He kissed his lovers soft blond curls. Jonathan mumbled something under his breath and rolled over; pulling the covers over his head. Gethin chuckled. Jonathan had never been one for mornings. He probably never would be. Jonathan was a night owl by nature. He pulled his dressing gown on before heading out the room. It wasn't until the kettle had finished boiling that Jonathan finally emerged from the bedroom. His hair was messy and his eyes still droopy from sleep. He looked absolutely adorable Gethin decided. He grinned at Jonathan before kissing him gently on his irresistible lips. 'Good Morning, Birthday boy' Gethin sung happily. He loved Jonathan's birthday. It was another reminder that they had both survived another year. 'I will never understand where you get your energy from in the mornings, love' Jonathan replied grumpily but nevertheless returned his lovers kiss. The two men gazed lovingly at each other for a moment before Gethin's stomach rumbled once more. They laughed and Gethin reached up to kiss Jonathan again. 'You could say it's a talent' he winked and went to make the tea. Gethin could feel Jonathan's gaze on his back as he poured the boiling water into two mugs. He smiled fondly at his mug. It had been a gift from Jonathan on their first Christmas together. Jonathan had painted it himself; a picture of the two of them kissing underneath the mistletoe. He put some bread in the toaster and left the tea to brew. Jonathan stood up and joined him by the counter and pulled him into a close embrace, resting his chin on Gethin's head before kissing his hair gently. 'I love you' Jonathan whispered gently into Gethin's messy brown locks. Gethin couldn't help but smile into his lover's chest. 'I love you too' He responded softly. The two remained like that for a few moments before the toaster popped. Gethin turned back to the tea to remove the tea bags whilst Jonathan took the butter and marmalade from the fridge and started to lay the table. They worked like clock-work together; Jonathan getting the plates and cutlery from the cupboards and drawers, whilst Gethin got the milk and sugar for the tea. Finally they both sat down at the table, Jonathan's foot rubbing lightly against Gethin's leg. 'So... Another year eh? Didn't think I'd make it this year' Jonathan said in between bites of toast. His tone was light, attempting to make a joke but Gethin could see the sorrow behind his eyes. They had lost a good many friends that year; Jonathan took it hard but they survived, together. 'Yeah, another year. I'll toast to that' Gethin said, raising his mug of tea. Jonathan laughed and clinked his mug with Gethin's. 'To surviving' 'To surviving' Jonathan repeats. They both smile sadly for a moment, remembering those who have passed. 'Any how… It's your birthday. We should do something to celebrate. It's a happy day.' Gethin breaks the silence first; determined to make the day special. Jonathan meets his gaze and winks. 'Celebrate eh? Well I could think of a few things...' Jonathan says in a deep suggestive voice. Gethin rolls his eyes and kicks him softly under the table. 'They'll be time for that later. Behave. I meant we should go out. Do something. See the world!' They both chuckle and Jonathan leans in to kiss the Welshman. Their lips meet in the middle and Gethin smiles. 'You're an idiot. You know that right?' 'Naturally, but I'm your idiot' Jonathan ruffles his hair and finishes the last mouthful of his tea. 'But you know what I would like to do?' 'Hmm… And what's that?' Gethin replies; sceptical that Jonathan's intentions are wholly innocent. 'I would like my birthday presents! You've kept me waiting long enough you sexy Welshman!' And Gethin laughs at his lover's sudden excitement. 'I'm dating a child…' Gethin rolls his eyes again but gets up. 'Wait here. I'll be right back' He leans down and kisses Jonathan's hair before darting out to the bedroom. 'Hurry back my love!' Jonathan shouts back from the kitchen and Gethin chuckles. He opens the doors to the wardrobe and pulls an old suitcase out from the back. The two men had an agreement not to look in each other's suitcases. Jonathan had raided their flat in the first year at Christmas looking for props for his pantomime. Subsequently he had discovered Gethin's presents for him thus them agreeing on a known 'hiding-place' to avoid a repeat. Gethin smiled at the memory. It had been a week before Christmas and Gethin had wrapped his present for Jonathan the day before, it was a dark black sparkly dress that he'd seen Jonathan eyeing up in a shop for some time. Jonathan's last dress had been badly ripped after an eventful night out ended in Jonathan getting beaten up; he'd sulked for days when Gethin had told him. Jonathan had come home from the theatre that evening and started flying round the flat like a mad man on a lifetime supply of coffee; pulling drawers out, throwing the pillows and covers off the bed, diving under the bed, and climbing half way up the wardrobe to pull some old boxes off the top. Gethin just stood in the lounge watching his mad lover run around the flat like an excited puppy on a scent. It was one of the cutest things he had ever seen. Suddenly the crashing had stopped. The whirlwind of Jonathan Blake faded into silence. Gethin had been worried that he was hurt and had rushed straight into the bedroom. He had found Jonathan on the bed, sitting cross-legged, staring at a bundle of black sequinned fabric. Gethin had stopped in his tracks, he had been devastated. The surprise was ruined. What he wasn't expecting was Jonathan to swiftly embrace him, picking him up and spinning him round before kissing him firmly on the lips. Jonathan didn't mind that the surprise had been ruined. He had been so taken aback that Gethin had actually noticed how much he loved the dress, and then made to effort to return later to buy it. That had been the first night they said 'I love you'. Gethin shaked his head and returned to the present day. He lifted the wrapped gift from the suitcase and went back to the kitchen; grinning like an idiot. 'What you smiling at love?' Jonathan asked, smiling himself. Happiness really is infectious. Gethin thought to himself. 'Our first Christmas… Remember?' And Jonathan did remember. His eyes lit up at the memory. 'You got me the dress' Jonathan said softly, his voice filled with the fondness. 'And you told me you loved me.' Gethin smiled lovingly at his boyfriend. 'Love, dear. Present tense. Past, present and future.' Jonathan stroked Gethin's cheek tenderly. Gethin felt his stomach flip and his face flushed a bright red. How on earth did I get to be so lucky? 'Past, present and future sounds perfect to me' Gethin beamed at his partner. He knew he would never tire of Jonathan's spontaneous outbursts of love. He was wildly unpredictable and Gethin loved every moment. 'So… Do you want your present? Or shall I take it back to the shop?' Gethin teased gently. 'Don't you bloody well dare!' Jonathan made a lunge for the present then ran back to the room with it. He jumped on the bed and sat crossed-legged. Just like that Christmas. Gethin thought happily as he watched Jonathan tear off the wrapping paper with a childlike excitement. Gethin leaned against the doorframe of their bedroom as he watched his boyfriend anxiously; hoping he'd like the gift. He'd worked hard to make it as perfect as possible. A leather-bound book fell into Jonathan's lap, gold calligraphy on the front cover: \" The Life and Friends of Jonathan Blake\". Jonathan looked up at Gethin in confusion. 'Happy Birthday, Love' Gethin whispered lovingly. 'What's this?' Gethin chuckled nervously and smiled at his lover. 'Why don't you have a look inside?' He rubbed his hands together subconsciously in anticipation. What if he doesn't like it? He started to panic inside. Jonathan turned to the first page of the book, smoothing down the page carefully. There was a picture of Jonathan in full-drag beaming at the camera, standing outside the bookshop. Beneath the picture was a small paragraph. Gethin couldn't see the words but he knew them off by heart; after all he had written them. 'Jonathan Blake: The man of my dreams, my lover, my saviour, my life. There just aren't the words to describe how much you mean to me Jonathan. I will always be grateful to have you in my life and to have spent these last few years with you. I love you. I wanted you to know just how much I love you, and how many people's lives you have made better just by being who you are. This book is a series of photographs of our friends, old and new. Those who have been able to have written captions for the photographs of them and about what your friendship means to them. I hope you'll finally be able to see how special you are to everyone around us. I love you – Gethin Roberts' Gethin recited, he tried desperately to keep his eyes fixed on Jonathan but his nerves won the battle. He closed his eyes as he finished the speech. 'Gethin…' Jonathan's voice broke through his nervous haze. Gethin opened his eyes once more to look at his lover. There were tears the older man's eyes. 'Yes?' He asked shyly; desperately wanting confirmation of Jonathan's approval. Is he crying because he hates it? Or because he loves it? 'This… This book' Jonathan began flicking slowly through the pages, stopping occasionally to stroke the faces in the pictures. 'Yeah?' Gethin repeated. 'I love it!' Jonathan put down the book carefully on the pillow before leaping off the bed and embracing his boyfriend. Gethin let out a sigh of relief He likes it! 'This is the most beautiful, perfect, thoughtful, personal, amazing gift anyone has ever given me!' Jonathan leaned down to kiss Gethin deeply. Gethin eagerly responded, parting his mouth and letting his tongue dance with his lover's. He moaned softly at the feeling and he ran his fingers through the soft blond curls, tugging gently. When the two men parted they were both flushed and panting slightly. 'I love you Jonathan Blake.' Gethin whispered against his boyfriend's chest. 'I love you more Gethin Roberts'. They both laughed. Jonathan refused to leave the house for the rest of the day. The two lovers lay in bed together, looking through the book and sharing memories of their friends. Gethin would run his hands through Jonathan's hair when the emotions got too much and they'd embrace until he felt able to continue. Gethin didn't mind that they ended up staying in bed. He couldn't remember a time when he'd felt happier or more at home. He wasn't home in Wales; his home wasn't the small flat above Gays the Word. His home was in Jonathan's arms, exchanging kisses and words of love. His home was Jonathan Blake. I'll probably post the second chapter tomorrow :) Hope you liked it.

There are a few shor"},{"Movie":"Bride and Prejudice","Title":"Bride and Prejudice the parade continues","Author":"ramacel","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11693653","Passage":"[Chapter 1] …Bride and Prejudice, following the wedding ceremony towards the D.N. Hotel Being from the same background as Lalitha, I wrote this to explain some things that should have been plaguing Will's thoughts has he and Lalitha draw closer to consummating their marriage on the wedding night. At this particular moment in his life, William Darcy, felt such contentment and happiness as he sat in the carriage, on the beautifully adorned elephant, next to his new wife, Lalitha Bakshi; no; Lalitha Darcy, as the parade traversed towards their final destination and the conclusion of the 3 day engagement and double wedding ceremony. The journey was even more pleasurable because he was finally able to enfold his new wife within his embrace, while managing to dampen the intensity of his obvious passion for her, and exhibited the correct degree of affection, in his embrace, that would not violate the Indian custom of not displaying too much affection in public even at one's own wedding ceremony. The delight of finally holding Lalitha in his arms was clearly displayed on his face, and his intimate stroking of his fingers along her beautifully decorated arms, was quite apparent to the parade watchers, as well is the tightening of his arm that encircled her waist as she sat in front of him upon the elephant carriage. His thoughts were pleasantly engaged with knowing that in the next hour he would finally be alone with Lalitha and have the opportunity to properly display his affection for her. During his reverie, he felt the pressure of Lalitha's back on his chest as she leaned back, and as she turned her face into his chest, she placed a quick kiss on his chin as he bent his head to draw her closer into his embrace. That was a bold gesture for his new wife; to display an intimate action during the very public parade when they, and Jaya and Bulraj, were the center of attention. He then heard her slightly inaudible \"Thank You Will\" as she turned her face forward towards our well-wishers as the parade continued towards the D.N. Hotel. Then it dawned on him, that she understood, the challenges he had to undertake, the things he had to learn, and the actions he had to partake in for their traditional Indian engagement and wedding ceremony. She loved him all the more for bearing it so enthusiastically and with a genuine display of pleasure. He was even more eager now to be alone with Lalitha, so that he could properly kiss her tantalizing lips, with the knowledge that he was and would be the only man to kiss her and touch her in the most intimate manner. That mental image brought with it another nagging thought. Lalitha had never been with another man nor had any experience, nor maybe even advice, about how she would manage the wedding night. She was most definitely a virgin, and with his limited experience with virgins, there would be some degree of pain during sexual intercourse. Why hadn't he thought about this before when he could have discussed this concern with Balraj? Balraj would know how to manage Jaya's first sexual experience and he could have gained some insights without making their discussion too embarrassing. Here again was another demonstration of his ignorance of his wife's culture and his thoughtlessness about how her first sexual experience would affect her, even though he knew that Lalitha loved him, as he did her, to distraction. Making sure Lalitha was as ease and comfortable with him, during their wedding night was now plaguing Will's thoughts. What was the usual Indian custom in preparing women for their nuptials and consummation of the marriage wows during the wedding night? Did Laltha's mother speak to her about the wedding night He remembered Lalitha's mother comments months ago, during a dinner party at the Bakshi residence, to Balraj about Balraj not having any complaints on the wedding. What did she mean by that comment? Was it simply about confirming proof that Jaya was a virgin? Will knew that the Indian custom required virginity of all highly sought after marriageable women, and the wedding night would require some instruction by the mothers of these women. Had Lalitha's mother had the wedding night conversation with Lalitha? But Will then remembered that Lalitha was not very close to her mother, rather, she spent more time in companionship with the father. Surely the wedding night talk was not a conversation that Lalitha's father would have with her, because it would not occur to him, that his intelligent Lalitha would not have done her \"wedding night homework.\" Will's thoughts finally settled on one course for action for his wedding night with Lalitha, he would be forth right, and he would ask her directly if she was comfortable with the knowledge that \"making love\" for the first time could be painful. If she was comfortable, what could he do to put her at ease, and was there anything in particular that she needed to help her relax so she could enjoy her first sexual experience, in spite of the initial pain that she would experience.[Chapter 2] Getting off the elephant Will's mental debate came to abrupt halt has the wedding parade halted near the entrance of the D.N. Hotel. Jaya and Balraj's wedding carriage, which preceded Lalitha and his carriage, had already stopped at the entrance of the hotel. Will was not quite sure what actions were required and should be taken for dismounting the wedding carriage considering that both couples were at quite a height astride the elephant. He watched with great attention as the hotel porters placed a ladder next to Jaya and Balraj's carriage and saw Balraj dismount the carriage by climbing down the ladder. After climbing down from the carriage, Balraj very carefully turned towards the carriage and beckoned Jaya to move forward towards the ladder and gently reached up to assist her with her decent down the ladder. Before Jaya reached the bottom rung of the ladder, Balraj reached forward and gathered her towards him by placing one hand around her back and the under her knees. He then turned towards the hotel entrance and carried her through the doors. Will felt a sense of relief after watching Jaya and Balraj dismount the wedding carriage. He was quite sure he could perform the same actions and would not embarrass himself nor Lalitha in the process without any hindrance from his wedding attire. After the disaster with the wedding attire Will had worn, when he first met Lalitha at Balraj's friend's wedding, he had taken great pains to learn how to wear a Khurta, and specifically, how to tie the draw string pants so that it did not loosen and fall to his ankles. During the 3 day engagement period before the wedding, Will had sought out and spent many hours with Mr. Bakshi. Will wanted to put Mr. Bakshi's mind at ease about his marriage to Lalitha, and he wanted Mr. Bakshi to get to know and understand him. On many of these visits, Mr. Bakshi had taken specific interest in teaching Will about Indian customs and traditions, and, he specifically described the wedding ritual and what was required of the groom. Mr. Bakshi had heard about Will's clothing malfunction during their initial introduction at Balraj's friend's wedding, and, during Will's visits, Mr. Bakshi spent time teaching Will how to tie and secure the draw stings pants from the groom's wedding attire. Will and Lalitha's carriage came to a stop at the entrance of the hotel, and, following the same actions performed by Balraj, Will climbed onto the ladder, that was placed next to the elephant by the hotel porter, and descended from the wedding carriage with as much grace as Balraj had displayed. Will then turned towards the wedding carriage and reached forward to assist Lalitha has she climbed down the ladder. Before Lalitha could reached the bottom rung on the ladder, Will gathered her to him, placing one hand around her back and the other hand under her knees and lifted her in his arms as he held her tightly against his chest. He felt, rather than saw, Lalitha lift her arms and wrap her arms around his neck as she leaned closer toward him. Lalitha's face was so close to his, and, if he bent his head slightly, he could brush his lips against hers. It took every ounce of his restrain not to bend his head, and instead, he focused his attention on the hotel entrance as he gracefully turned and entered the double door of the hotel with Lalitha in his arms.[Chapter 3] Hotel Room As Will entered the hotel lobby carrying Lalitha in his arms, he saw that Jaya was now standing next to Balraj and the couple was being greeted by the hotel staff with the traditional Indian flower garland and 'tikka' applied on the guest's forehead. Will followed suit and slowly released Lalitha from his arms by removing his arm from under Lalitha's knees and gently set her upon her feet. Will slowly released his arm from Lalitha's back and reluctantly drew it away from Lalitha's body. While doing so, Will trailed his fingers on the exposed skin of Lalitha's midriff, which was left exposed by the traditional wedding garment worn by Lalitha. She wore a well-fitted choli (blouse), falling just below her breasts, a rich embroidered lehenga (skirt) sitting upon her hips leaving a fair amount of Lalitha's midriff uncovered, and a flowing dupatta (veil) covering her head. A slight gasp escaped from Lalitha's lips as she turned towards Will and raised her eyes towards his face. Will's gaze rested on Lalitha's eyes as he watched her pupils dilated, her tongue slowly crept out of her mouth and across her lips as she moistened her lips. Will's eyes were transfixed on Lalitha's lips. He no longer saw or heard anyone around them as he felt himself leaning towards Lalitha to place his lips upon her moistened mouth. Will was startled out of his actions by the feel of Lalitha's hand upon his chest as she gently pushed him away from her. He saw the slight shake of her head indicating to him that his thoughts and almost actions were not appropriate in the hotel lobby. (During their brief engagement period, Lalitha had given Will a litany of dos and don'ts, of appropriate behavior, between couples in the public venues.) Will understood her actions and took a step away from Lalitha and clasped his hands behind his back. Then Will and Lalitha moved in unison towards the hotel lobby where the staff were waiting to officially welcomed them with the traditional Indian flower garland and 'tikka' applied on their foreheads. When the welcoming ceremony was completed, both newly wedded couples, Jaya and Balraj and Lalitha and Will, were ushered into the waiting elevator to be taken to their respective hotel chambers. While the D.N. Hotel was one of the best hotels in Amritsar, the hotel only had one bridal suite. During the hurried preparations for their double wedding, Balraj and Will had discussed who should occupy the bridal suite for their wedding night. Since Will was thrust into the Indian culture with very little time to learn the customs, traditions, behaviors, and ceremonies, Balraj felt Will should be rewarded for his efforts, and he presented the bridal suite to Will for his and Lalitha's wedding night. Moreover, if Will managed through the wedding ceremony, specifically riding in the elephant carriage, the luxury of the bridal suite would erase any discomfort Will might have experienced during the ride. When the hotel elevator arrived at its first destination, and the doors opened, Balraj and Jaya stepped out of the elevator, turned to face Will and Lalitha, wished them a happy evening, and told them that they would meet in the morning. Two of the hotel staff members followed Jaya and Balraj out of the elevator and the elevator doors closed again. Two hotel staff members remained with Lalitha and Will as the elevator ascended to the top most floor of the hotel, the bridal suite. The elevator finally reached its destination, the doors slid open, and there in front of Lalitha and Will was a set of double doors left slightly ajar. Will and Lalitha stepped out of the elevator and the two remaining hotel staff members followed them out of the elevator. As Lalitha and Will walked towards the doors of the bridal suite, the two hotel staff members increased their pace and reached past Will to open the doors wider to beacon Lalitha and Will inside. Instinctually, without giving any thought to his possibly violating Indian customs, Will placed is arms around Lalitha and lifted her off the floor, and held her close to his chest, as he carried her over the threshold into the bridal suite, the two hotel staff members beamed with delight. Upon entering the bridal suite with Lalitha in his arms, Will gently released her so that she could stand. Because he was still holding Lalitha close to his chest, Will felt the pressure of Lalitha's body movements on his body as she gained her footing and stood next to him. The pressure of her soft skin on his body, the intoxicating aroma of henna, the sweetness of her jasmine perfume, the tinkling sounds of her anklets and bangles, and her inaudible \"thank you\" were nearly his undoing. He was lost in the scent that was only Lalitha and he desperately wanted to carry her into the bedroom and ignite her passion and make exquisitely gentle love to her.[Chapter 4] Special traditional kesar badam (saffron and almond) milk for the wedding Night The clapping by the hotel staff members jarred Will out of his daydream and he slowly removed his arm from Lalitha's body. One of the hotel staff members spoke to Lalitha in Hindi and Lalitha responded by clasping Will's hand and urging him to follow her. Will ascertained from the staff member's gestures and actions that he was providing a tour of the bridal suite and its amenities. Well, Will thought to himself that is one way to get to the bedroom. For Will, the tour was actually quite illuminating because there were many amenities in the bridal suite that were extremely luxurious and very unique to Indian culture. The living room contained a sunken area with a steps leading down to a plush carpeted floor and was filled with huge pillows of various colors and sizes. Next was the dining room where the dining table was elegantly arranged for two with various Indian delicacies, snacks, sweets, champagne, and wines. Then there was the bathroom which was massive and contained a hot-tub with super-jets, and a glass enclosed shower with showerheads mounted on all four walls at various heights. The bathroom also had a steam-room and sauna. Finally Will entered the bedroom, which was decorated with heavily fragrant, fresh flowers. Will had read that it is believed that the sweet, natural fragrance of the flowers created a romantic mood for the newlyweds. Will smiled to himself as he thought about how romance was definitely something, that he and Lalitha had plenty of, and how it had grown exponentially in such a short time. The staff member was now leading the way back to the bridal suite lobby, and, he and the second staff member, turned around and gave the traditional Indian farewell bow, with hands claps together in front, to Lalitha and him. As the bridal suite door was closed behind the departing staff members, Will turned deliberately around and walked slowly towards Lalitha. He stared intently at her face as he continued his short journey towards her. Lalitha was also staring at him intently and then his eyes lowered to her lips he noticed the slight trembling of her lips. Was she afraid of the inevitable intimacy that he wanted so desperately to share with her? Will's passion and desire was apparent as he drew closer to Lalitha, and his breathing increased and intensified. But the trembling of Lalitha's lips had changed Will's desire to protectiveness. Lalitha's trembling lips had resurrected a protective response within him and he felt an urgent need to comfort Lalitha. As Will reached Lalitha, he very gently drew her into his arms and wrapped his arms around her, to enfold her in his arms. He murmured softly into her jasmine fragrant hair, \"Lalitha I love so much and I cannot express the depths of my happiness that you consented to be my wife. But, please know that we have our entire lives to learn about each other and we do not have to do anything tonight that makes you uncomfortable or nervous.\" Will continued softly, \"I realize that we are from different backgrounds and there are things that you have not experienced, and your knowledge about what to do or want to do tonight is not important to me. There is nothing that we have to do or prove to anyone.\" \"Talk to me baby. Tell what you are thinking. Please don't ever feel shy or embarrassed about telling me what you are feeling.\" Lalitha raised her head and looked into Will's eyes. Will saw the tears brimming in her eyes and felt his heart constrict. What had he done now or said to bring tears to Lalitha's eyes? \"Lalitha what is wrong? What did I do to make you cry? With the tears slowly over-flowing from her eyes, Lalitha raised her head further and placed her lips on Will's chin. Then Will heard Lalitha murmur, \"You have done nothing wrong; instead, you have said everything right.\" \"It is true that I'm inexperienced with these matter nor what you want or expect tonight. I want us to really talk about what you want and need from me and to be patient if my actions and responses don't fulfill your expectations. \"What I want is for us to really talk about how we begin to share this intimacy between us. About the resulting consequences of our intimacy.\" Will stared at Lalitha in amazement. This was exactly the conversation he had planned to have with Lalitha when they were finally alone together. At least that had been his intention, but, those plans had vanished from his thoughts once he had experienced the pleasure of trailing his fingers on Lalitha's exposed midriff in the hotel lobby. Will gently wiped the tears from Lalitha's eyes with the tips of his fingers and bent forward to place his forehead against her forehead. Then he whispered, \"Let's talk baby. There is a wonderful meal in the dining that is beaconing, and, I am starving.\" Lalitha nodded her head in acquiescence as her tears dissipated and slight smile began to form on her mouth. As Will raised his head, he could see that Lalitha's facial expression were more relaxed, and he gently put his arm around her shoulders and drew her towards the dining room. Will released Lalitha from his embrace as they reached the dining table, and he pulled out a chair at the dining table and he invited her to take a seat. Lalitha appeared as if she was gliding towards the chair still adorned in her wedding attire. As she moved forward, her skirt floated around her and he heard the tinkling of her anklets (payal) with each movement. Will sat in the seat directly across the table from Lalitha. The dining table was laden with all types of Indian delicacies. Among the various food dishes, there was several types of vine as well as champagne. But, Will's attention was drawn to a silver flask in the center of the table, that was covered with jasmine flowers, with a small card lying next to it with the words \"for Lalitha\" written on the card. While Lalitha's attention was happily focused on the vast array of sweets from mango burfi topped with pistachio, to pedas, to warm syrupy goodness of gulab jamun, to large batches crispy jalebi, to Rasmalai the creamy sweet delight, to kaju katli a sweet but not overwhelmingly treat, to Kheer the sweet rice noodles soaked with cardamom, milk, and sugar bring much needed calm. Lalitha's attention settled on tasting the Kheer, meanwhile, Will's curiosity was piqued by the contents of the sliver flask which he picked up to determine its contents before he would consider giving it to Lalitha. Will unscrewed the top of the flask and brought the flask near his nose to sniff its contents. The liquid had a pleasant rosewater aroma. Will had seen many women drink various aromatic sweet creamy non-alcoholic brews and beverages during the 3 day engagement ceremony. It was likely a similar non-alcoholic concoction meant for the bride. Will extended the silver flask, across the dining table and offered it to Lalitha, \"Lalitha do you know what this is? It has a very pleasant aroma, and according to this card, it is meant for you.\" Lalitha took the flask from Will and sniffed the contents. Lalitha then responded, \"Oh my, that is kesar badam a traditional saffron and almond milk drink which helps relax the bride for the wedding night and is often considered an aphrodisiac. Will smiled hesitantly and said, \"Don't worry about the aphrodisiac part; but I'm glad it is meant for you to relax. Lalitha gave Will a shy smile and poured the creamy fragrant liquid into one of the many glasses arranged on the dining table. She slowly sipped the milky liquid as Will watched her with slight concern on his face. \"Mmmmm, this is really good Lalitha acclaimed. It tastes like warm almond ice cream.\" Lalitha drank the entire glass of kesar badam and reached for the sliver flask to pour more of its contents into her empty glass. Will saw the subtle change in Lalitha's expressions and posture after drinking the creamy liquid. He noted that her shoulders and hand were visibly relaxed and she was smiling more and giggling about the wonderful taste of the kesar badam. Will wondered what was really in that beverage? It appeared to Will that the beverage contained more that sweet almond milk and he would bet that the beverage contained some type of common poppy seed opiate. The poppy seed was very common in India, and, its use in foods and beverages was very popular. Will wondered if it was common practice for the kesar badam beverage to be laced with opiate to help the bride relax and attain a euphoric state for the wedding night. Well it sure was putting Lalitha into a euphoric state and she was laughing bit too much. Clearly the potency of the beverage had a stronger effect on Lalitha than expected. Lalitha started to rise from her chair and commented that she was quite sleepy and would lay on the couch in the living room. Her movements were not steady, which alarmed Will, because there was a strong likelihood of Lalitha falling on the way to the living room or falling down into the sunken living room. Will quickly rose from his chair and went to assist her and said to her, \"Lalitha, why don't you lie on the bed in the bedroom rather than the living. If you want to sleep, you don't have to move.\" Will put his arm around Lalitha's shoulders and guided her towards the bedroom. Lalitha seemed to get groggier with each step and leaning more heavily on Will. Before they could reach the bedroom entrance, Lalitha had closed her eyes and began to slip downward towards the floor. Will immediately caught her in his arms, and putting one arm under her knees, he carried her to the bedroom and gently laid her on top of the luxurious quilt upon the bed. Will watched Lalitha as she turned onto her side and curled her knees closer to her body as her breathing deepened. Will had anticipated that his wedding night would be unusual, and he had hoped that he and Lalitha could have spent time talking. However, more than anything else that had happened today, Will was just happy to have the right to be in the life of this unusually beautiful, intelligent, kind, provocative, and sometimes stubborn woman, who was now his wife. There was plenty of time in their lives to experience marital intimacies. Will wanted more than anything to get to know Lalitha, especially the private Lalitha, who not everyone got the privilege of knowing. Will bent down and gently kissed his wife's forehead and then covered her with the quilt that was covering the bed. Will returned to the dining room, and looking at all the delicious food spread on the table felt, he began to feel quite hungry. He also had not eaten anything since the wedding ceremony, which had taken place quite early in the morning, and it was now 5 pm in the evening. Will picked up the Indian food items, that he could recognize, and began eating with a sense of profound joy, contentment, and peace. ","Summary":" …Bride and Prejudice, following the wedding ceremony towards the D.N. Hotel Being from the same bac"},{"Movie":"Pride, 2014","Title":"Souls Among the Stars","Author":"AvengersBarnes","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12395363","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The night of the Pits and Perverts benefit concert was magical. Mark owned the stage during his speeches and for one glorious evening the gays and the straights, and as Mark said the undecided, were united. For one night it didn't matter whether you liked guys or girls. It didn't matter for the first time in most of LGSM's lives. The atmosphere was electric and everyone was drowning in the music and the alcohol. The straights danced with the gays and their friends from Dulais were having a ball. It had been the first time out in London for most of the Welsh folk and they were certainly making the most of it. Mike watched Mark in awe as he spoke to the giant crowd. He was unable to take his eyes off the Irishman. Mark's eyes were alive and sparkling with an infectious energy which grew from his uncontainable excitement. The light was dancing off his earring and lit up the natural brown highlights in his hair. In that moment Mike had never felt so in love with the bundle of energy that was Mark Ashton. Mark was capable of achieving anything he set his brilliant mind to. Even if Mike tried to gently dissuade him from the more spectacular plans, Mark always got it done. Once the band started to play Mark had jumped down from the stage to join Mike on the dance floor. They let the music guide their bodies as they moved in time to the beat of the drum machine. Mike's breath caught in his throat as he felt Mark's body move against his. Heat radiated between the two men and Mike could have sworn he felt Mark's lips brush against his neck. His head was spinning, although that might have been from the alcohol. He let his eyes flutter shut and he was lost in the moment; one fantastic moment of joy and the feeling of belonging. One song blurred into another and Mike lost track of how long he was dancing in the warm embrace of his best friend. His heart ached as he thought of the word 'friend'. He desperately wished that he could use another word to describe Mark; boyfriend perhaps. He let out a sigh and Mark pulled back to look at him with a questioning look in his eyes. Mike gave him a reassuring smile that he knew didn't quite reached his eyes. Mike had forgotten how long he'd been pining over his best friend. He'd just come to accept the feelings now. They wouldn't be fading anytime soon. Mark offered to go get them some drinks from the bar which Mike enthusiastically accepted. His throat felt dry from the smoky room and he needed some space from the Irishman to clear his head. Mike took a moment to scan the room. Jeff was happily chatting with Steph at the bar, although Mike noticed how frequently the blond looked over in Joe's direction. Joe had come out of his shell; he was glowing with excitement as he circled the dance floor with a big grin on his face and taking pictures on his camera. Mike looked over to the merchandise stall by the doorway. Even though the party was in full swing there were still a few people queueing for t-shirts and badges. Mike could see a stack of empty boxes behind the makeshift counter; an indication as to the success of the night so far. Mike couldn't help but smile fondly. Mark would be so proud when he realised. Soon enough Mark returned with their drinks; two pints of ice cold beer. Mike thanked him and offered to give him the money but Mark refused. They moved to the side of the room so they could drink the pints away from the crowd. Mike let out a long breath as he felt the icy liquid flow through his body to his stomach. The taste was bitter but refreshing. It made a change from the sweaty air around them. They chatted a while about the event as they enjoyed their drinks. Mike noticed that Mark's voice was getting increasingly slurred as the night went on. Eventually, Mike felt Mark's head resting on his shoulder. He smiled and he felt his heartbeat quicken. For a moment he could pretend that they were more than just best friends. He turned and kissed Mark's soft brown hair. He heard Mark mumble something but it was lost in the music. Knowing that Mark would have to make an ending speech as the event drew to a close, Mike dutifully fetched a glass of water for them both and dragged the slightly inebriated Irishman to the bar to sit down for a while. He was chattering away about some new plan to raise money. Mike thought he heard the words 'drag competition' and 'Dulais'. He chuckled at the thought of some of miners in drag. Dai would probably give it a go even if it was just to show solidarity. He wasn't so sure about the others. Hefina and the girls on the committee would certainly get a giggle out of it. Mike hoped Mark would forget about that particular idea by morning though. It would do more damage than good he thought. They were already unsure whether they'd be allowed to raise any more money for the miners after tonight due to their being gay and all. As they sat down at the bar next to Jeff and Steph, who was still avoiding Zoe and Stella, Mark grabbed Mike's shoulders and pulled him into a kiss. Mike faintly heard the other two whooping behind him but he was soon lost in the feeling of Mark's lips against his. His heart was racing a million miles an hour as he felt Mark's tongue brush against his lower lip. He gladly parted his lips and let Mark deepen the kiss. Their tongues stroked against each other and Mike could taste the alcohol on Mark's breath. Too soon Mike had to pull back for air. He was panting slightly and his head was spinning again although this time he was certain that it wasn't the alcohol. Mark fell forward slightly into Mike's lap and rested his head on Mike's shoulder once more. Mike could feel his cheeks heat burning as he sat for a moment in a happy daze. When he finally came back to the loud and sweaty electric ballroom, Jeff and Steph had buggered off. He glanced around quickly but he saw no sign of them. He decided they must have gotten lost within the crowd on the dance floor. Further down the bar, a brunet looked like he was chatting up their official photography. Joe had flushed a deep red and was clearly flattered by the attention. Mike felt a little sorry for Jeff but the blond should have made a move sooner. Mike turned his attention back to the drunk Irishman next to him. He had linked his fingers with Mike's and was singing softly along with the music. Mike's could feel his heart still pounding in his chest from the unexpected kiss. He couldn't remember a time where he'd been happier. Soon enough the evening wound down and a slightly less inebriated Mark Ashton took to the stage for a final time. Mike watched proudly as Mark thanked everyone for coming and both he and Dai spoke of the friendship between LGSM and the people of Dulais. They shook hands and slowly the crowd started to dissipate and the music slowly faded away. Hefina and Gail insisted that the party continued though. So the members of LGSM, minus a certain photographer, faithfully led their friends through all their favourite party spots around London. The shrieks of the women could be heard from a block away and the bouncers of the clubs really didn't know what to think of the excited Welsh ladies. Mike stayed close to Mark for the rest of the evening. They were often seen holding hands between clubs or dancing close together. Occasionally they would just stay outside together and share a cigarette. Those were Mike's favourite moments. He felt a calmness come upon him as the smoke filled his lungs and he enjoyed watching the end of the cigarette glow a bright orange as Mark inhaled deeply. They both were more mesmerised than usual by the patterns that the smoke made in the cold air. The mood was shattered going into one the clubs. They were almost through the door when Mike heard a man calling Mark's name. Mark obviously recognised the man; called Tim apparently. Mike was shooed inside as the Irishman stayed behind to talk to the stranger. Mike felt his heart sink as he went inside the club alone. He wondered who the man was. He felt a strange pain in his chest as he pondered on Tim's relationship with Mark. From the way he said Mark's name Mike assumed they had once been lovers. A surge of jealousy swept over him and he had to resist punching the wall. He saw Jeff looking at him in pity. Mike was pretty sure Jeff was feeling the same thing. He'd been sulking ever since Joe had disappeared. Steph, less than helpfully, pointed out that Joe had last been seen snogging some attractive young man. Jeff had muttered something about that being illegal because Joe was underage. Still at least their Welsh friends were having a good time. They delighted in questioning the bar staff in every club. At least they were becoming more aware of the gay community; fighting back the horrendous stereotypes that the media tried to sell. Mike sat at the bar with a whiskey. It wasn't his preferred drink but he suddenly craved something a bit stronger. He winced slightly as the liquid burned his throat. He looked disgusted at the glass wondering how people liked the stuff. He glanced back at the door every so often to check to see if Mark had made an entrance yet. On the third look he was rewarded by the sight of the Irishman walking towards him. Mark looked perplexed. That was the only way to describe it. He was suddenly deep in thought and Mike gave him a questioning look. Upon meeting Mike's eyes all concern fell from Mark's face and he gave his friend a dazzling smile. Mike couldn't help but smile back. Mark's happiness was truly infectious to the Englishman. The rest of the evening went smoothly but Mike couldn't help but noticed that Mark's energy had fallen since the encounter with Tim. He held Mike's hand a little tighter than before and quite frequently planted a kiss on Mike's cheek. Mike blushed a little every time. Mark never kissed him on the lips again though and Mike couldn't help but wonder why. Mike sighed to himself softly as the memory faded into the cold Welsh air. His breath clouded in front of him in a swirling mist. Of course he knew now why Mark didn't kiss him on the lips after that moment. Tim had been on what he called 'a farewell tour'. Mark wasn't stupid. He knew what that meant and he knew what that could mean for himself. Tim had been ill. The dreaded illness had claimed another victim from the gay community. Mike closed his eyes tightly and counted to ten. He let out a deep breath and attempted to calm his rage. Life wasn't fair and neither was death. He hugged his coat round him and looked out forlornly at the rolling hills of the Welsh countryside. He remembered walking along these trails the first time they had visited Dulais. Cliff had shown them around the old castle ruins as he recited poetry. That seemed like a lifetime ago now. Mark had been the only person that was convinced a union between the gays and the miners would work. He had, of course, been right. Mike brushed his hands through the grass. He felt at home amongst the hills in the rural landscape. He was closer to nature this way. He'd always been fond of gardening and it helped him to relax. When Mark had been in hospital he'd started a small gardening plot in the back of the flat they had shared. Mike chatted quite animatedly about the progress of the plants and in the last few days in had been able to bring in photographs of the small shoots that were beginning to poke through the earth. Mike had hoped he would be able to bring in a bunch of the flowers grown from his garden when they were ready but unfortunately that was never to be. Mark had passed away soon after the shoots had appeared. They hadn't let Mike see him the day Mark died. Instead he'd sat in the waiting room with Gethin. The others had visited throughout the week but Gethin had been there almost as frequently as Mike had. He didn't cry when he heard the news. He sat in the cold, hard plastic chair in the waiting room and stared at the wall. Mike didn't know how long he sat there for but he was snapped out of his daze by Joe who handed him a carefully wrapped sandwich and a flask of tea. He took the items and walked out of the hospital in a foggy haze. He'd worked in his garden all night. Steph had found him the next morning passed out and covered in dark soil from head to toe. She'd taken him inside and pushed him towards the shower. Finally he'd been able to cry. As the hot water flowed over his body and he watched the dirt wash down the drain, his legs gave way and he fell onto the cold tiles. The soapy water was mixed with the salty tears that were streaming down his cheeks. He heard Steph's concerned voice shouting through the door. He was barely able to let out a choked noise to let her know he was ok. He felt a sharp stinging sensation in his knees and as he looked down he saw a trace of blood swirling in the water. His knees had been damaged when he fell. His chest felt tight and he struggled to breathe properly as the grief overwhelmed him. He was both mentally and physically exhausted from the last few weeks. Steph had almost been about to break down the bathroom door when Mike had finally emerged. His knees had already started to bruise but the bleeding had stopped. He had noticed Steph looking at his knees but she said nothing. She helped him get ready for bed before crashing on the sofa. He had been grateful that she stayed. He dreamt that night of Mark. The Irishman was helping him in his garden and questioning Mike about what the different flowers meant. The flowers grew fast in his dream and soon bloomed into daffodils. Mike was momentarily confused because he had been sure that he had planted poppies but somewhere in the back of his mind he was aware that he was dreaming. When the daffodils were fully grown Mark helped to pick them and the two men sat laughing as they weaved the flowers into a grown. Mark looked like an angel in his golden daffodil crown. It had been a pleasant dream and one that Mike still thought fondly of. He'd written it down in a notebook the next morning along with a rough drawing of Mark in his crown of daffodils. He smiled a little as he watched the sun begin to set behind the Welsh hills. Daffodils were the national flower of Wales so it made sense that he had dreamt of them. Mark had finally found a family in the small Welsh village of Dulais. As the sunlight faded and the red and blue sky transformed into a deep purple, Mike heard his name being called. Margaret was walking up the trail behind him; wrapped up in a thick coat with a matching set of gloves, scarf and hat. In her arms she carried an extra pair of gloves and a scarf. Mike gladly took the woolly items and the pair walked back towards the village together in silence; preparing themselves for the challenges that tomorrow would bring.[Chapter 2] Mike stood in front of the mirror in the bathroom of Dai and Margaret's house. He'd not slept well the night before and it showed. If he was totally honest with himself he hadn't slept well in months. He hoped that once his friend was laid peacefully to rest that he himself would be granted some much needed sleep. His face was pale, a dusty grey colour, and he had dark circles around his eyes. His normally bright irises had faded to dull and were constantly red around the edges. Mike splashed some icy water on his face in an attempt to wash away the tears from last night's bad dreams. The tear stains on Mike's cheek disappeared down the drain with the water but he still looked dreadful. Mike didn't know how long he was staring into the small bathroom mirror but it must have been longer than he thought as he was snapped back to earth by a gentle knock on the door. He heard Margaret call his name through the wooden door. She sounded concerned and he felt a pang of guilt for worrying her. He called back that he was fine and would be down in a minute. The Englishman checked his watched and cursed as he realised he was late. His morning self-pity would have to wait until the next day. He quickly brushed his hair and straightened his tie and glasses. Mike thought he looked ridiculous without his signature beanie hat and stuffed into the too big suit. He was not meant for formal wear. He sighed to himself and went to meet his friends downstairs. As Mike reached the bottom of the stairs, he was handed a flask of tea and a biscuit from Dai's ever-caring wife. He didn't feel hungry at all but he dutifully nibbled at the sugary treat before they all hurried out the house to join the rest of their friends at the town hall. Everyone looked sombre in the black formal outfits as they trudged up the Welsh hill towards the castle. Steph had even made an effort to cover her brightly covered hair. She wore a smart black hat over the orange locks which looked unusually tamed today. Jonathan and Gethin were the only two members of LGSM that looked comfortable in their suits. Mike guessed that this was not the first funeral that the two men had been to recently, probably not even the second. That meant they had spent a little more money on their attire, probably aided by the fact they'd had more years to save up for a nicer suit. The former gay libber's were holding hands tightly as they made their way up the muddy path; carefully avoiding the puddles. Zoe and Stella walked near the front of the travelling party. Their long onyx dresses floated in the wind; they were a picture of grace and beauty. Mike thought that they looked like angels of death as they led the party onwards towards the castle. Jeff was closely following the young baker and the two blonds were helping each other navigate the dirt path. Mike noticed on several occasions Jeff's hand lingered a little too long of Joe's arm after he'd hopped over a puddle. Mike couldn't help the wave of jealousy that flooded over him as he watched the two younger men interact. They'd grown closer since Mark's death as they had been there to comfort each other. It wasn't fair; Mike had never had the chance to have that with Mark. He tried to shake that thought from his head. He knew that the jealousy was making his thoughts irrational and the two boys probably hadn't even realised they were displaying so many gestures of affection. Mike looked over at the Welshmen who had decided to join them. Many of the men and women had not liked Mark when LGSM had first arrived. He didn't even recognise some of the faces in the crowd. They had watched Mark with distaste as he had tried to light-heartedly introduce LGSM. They had voted against accepting any more money from the group in favour of going back to work in the mines purely because they didn't want to be supported by gays. Yet they were here today, walking up the hill to pay their respects to the great man that was Mark Ashton. His death had united them. However, Mike couldn't help but feel a little pessimistic about the true reason behind their presence today. He suspected that the majority of the miners, especially those who had barely spoken to Mark, were attending so they appeared to seem thankful for all the hard work Mark had done for their community. It was probably a way of dampening their guilt for their actions. He doubted that anyone of them actually cared for the Irishman. Mike tried to push away his bitterness. This service was supposed to be for those who had loved Mark Ashton; not a tool for dispersing guilt. He glared accusingly at the nearest unknown face in the crowd. The older man shrunk back slightly and turned to talk to a nearby friend. Mike felt a hand on his shoulder and he spun round to find Jonathan looking down at him. Jonathan told him to ignore the fakers and remember the solidarity that Mark had stood for. It wasn't much but it was a slight comfort to Mike. Mark would probably have made some crazy joke about the people who had hated him in life; something about finally converting them. Mike chuckled quietly to himself. He tried to ignore the questioning looks from Steph and Gail who were closest to him. Jonathan just smiled and fell back once more to be with Gethin. Mike glanced briefly at the small Welshman. Gethin looked almost as exhausted as he did. He was gripping Jonathan's hand tightly and, even though Jonathan was clearly in good health, Gethin's eyes were full of worry and his face looked gaunt. The long days had affected Gethin badly. Jonathan had snuck in to see Mark whenever Gethin was asleep. He knew that his lover would panic too much if he had known that he was visiting Mark. Mike hated to see how Mark's illness had hurt the older couple. It had almost torn them apart at the seams but they had made it through the rough times and had both come out the other side alive; which is more than could be said about Mark. A sharp pain shot through Mike's chest. He gripped onto Steph's arm to prevent him from falling as his legs gave way and the flask of tea dropped from his hand. He wasn't ready to say goodbye. He faintly heard his voice saying that repeatedly as the world began to spin. Mark wasn't dead. He couldn't be. Mark was the most alive and vibrant person he knew. A crowd of black began to circle him as he was lowered slowly onto the path. He thought he heard Jonathan's voice saying his name, or was it Jeff's voice? It didn't matter to Mike. It wasn't Mark's voice that was calling him. Suddenly Mike felt his breathing become short as he struggled to gasp for oxygen. He grasped at his tie and tried to yank it off but he only managed to tighten the knot. The voices around him faded to a quiet hum as his vision blurred. Finally his throat was free from the constricting fabric and he sucked in a huge gulp of air. Mike heard a sob and it took him a moment to realise he was crying. He looked down at his mud-covered hands; they were shaking. Margaret had managed to retrieve the tea flask and poured out a small cup. He smiled and took the tea carefully; trying not to spill the scolding liquid. From her bag Margaret produced a packet of chocolate biscuits and she insisted that he ate one; something about the sugar would do him good. Mike mumbled an apology to the group as he ate the biscuit. His friends waited patiently for him to feel ok again. Soon enough his legs began to regain their strength and with the help of Ray and Reggie he was able to continue up the path to the castle. He heard some of the older Welshmen complaining about his episode but Cliff quickly shot them down; telling them to return to the village if they didn't want to be there. To his surprise nobody left. It wasn't a real funeral. Mark's family had held a small one back in Ireland for him. Mark's parents had blissfully ignored their son's sexuality and all the work he had done whilst he lived in London. So Mike had decided to organise a sort of funeral in Dulais for all Mark's friends to say goodbye. They were going to light candles around the Welsh castle and everyone who wanted to say something about Mark would have a chance. Slowly the group made their way around the castle, placing tea-lights on the cold grey stone. Every time Mike lit a candle he said a small prayer for Mark. He wasn't a religious man but for some reason, on that day, he wanted to believe in heaven. There was total silence until the last candle was lit and the castle glowed brightly against the Welsh countryside. Some of the older miner's only lit one candle each and then waited as they watched the others work. Cliff was the one to break the eerie silence. 'And death shall have no dominion. Dead man naked they shall be one With the man in the wind and the west moon; When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone, They shall have stars at elbow and foot; Though they go mad they shall be sane, Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; Though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion. And death shall have no dominion. Under the windings of the sea They lying long shall not die windily; Twisting on racks when sinews give way, Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; Faith in their hands shall snap in two, And the unicorn evils run them through; Split all ends up they shan't crack; And death shall have no dominion. And death shall have no dominion. No more may gulls cry at their ears Or waves break loud on the seashores; Where blew a flower may a flower no more Lift its head to the blows of the rain; Though they be mad and dead as nails, Heads of the characters hammer through daisies; Break in the sun till the sun breaks down, And death shall have no dominion.'* Cliff's old course voice wavered only once as he recited the words of Dylan Thomas. Mike found himself sitting down on the thick green grass as he had done the night before. He let his fingers weave through the blades and he felt the dirt behind his nails as Cliff's soothing tone filled the air. There was not a dry eye in the castle when the poem reached its end. Cliff quietly said goodbye to Mark and sat down with the others on the stone wall. One by one the members of LGSM said their goodbyes to the Irishman. Jeff left a rainbow scarf by the castle that he had knitted along with a daffodil. Joe left a box of choux pastry and a photograph of LGSM after their first visit to Dulais then went to join Jeff. The two blonds huddled together on the grass and Mike noticed their hands were entwined. Steph laid down an old Bananarama vinyl and a small box of earrings. Jonathan and Gethin said a few words about the importance of awareness about Mark's illness and they praised him for his work for gay rights. Jonathan had drawn a picture of Mark smiling and Gethin had written a small paragraph in Welsh below. Dai later told Mike that the Welsh had said how much Mark would be missed by all. Dai and the committee hung up the Dulais Valley flag in an archway of the castle; carefully minding the flames. It waved gently in the wind and Mike felt a tear roll down his cheek as he gazed at the two hands shaking firmly. When it was his turn to speak Mike talked about the progress of his garden back in London. He spoke about the meaning of the different flowers he had planted. The daffodil was a symbol of chivalry; something Mark had shown an abundance of. The yellow tulip was a sign of hopeless love. Mike's cheeks turned pink as he admitted that. He'd never told Mark the truth about that flower. He said that the yellow tulip meant loyalty. He placed photographs of each flower in the growing pile of tributes and gifts. He had brought two real flowers with him from the garden; a forget-me-not and a white lily. Mark would be remembered. Eventually the sun began to fade behind the mountain. Angharad, the woman who had originally started the anthem in the town hall so long ago, began to sing once more. Her voice rang out over the mountains. This time LGSM joined in with the choir of Welsh voices and they sang until tears streamed down their faces. The soft harmony filled the air and the small candles burnt brightly around the castle on the hill. It was truly a gorgeous sight and a fitting goodbye for a beautiful soul. Mark's soul was now among the stars that were beginning shine above them in the dark sky. Cold and emotionally exhausted the mourners made their way back down to the village. That night Mike slept peacefully in the small bed in Wales. His dreams were happy memories of the man he would always love deep down in his heart. * Poem is 'And Death Shall Have No Dominion' - Dylan Thomas ","Summary":" The night of the Pits and Perverts benefit concert was magical.

It belongs to the brilliant Stephen Beresford and the people of LGSM and the Dulais Valley. Alan Pritchard's day started like any other, slightly hung over! His wife, Gail, cooked him a full breakfast and sent him off to work. At 12:10 pm Gail got the call miners' wives dread, Alan had been in an accident – the roof he was putting up props to support had come down on him. He was buried alive. Gail went to the colliery straight away. Well, almost straight away, she rang her friend Steph in London to tell her first, they'd chatted for a bit. Gail usually felt better after talking to Steph but this time she felt something else: guilt. Gail waited at the pithead for news. Sian and Margaret were with her. A couple of hours later the men started to come to the surface, all with grim faces. The rescue and recovery team had gone down an hour earlier. \"They're digging through but it is going to be a long job. Got to take it slow or risk further falls.\" said Martin when he joined them after he had showered and changed. Gail started to cry. \"He's dead isn't he?\" she said between sobs. \"We don't know that yet.\" Cliff had joined them. Margaret gives Gail a hug. \"What was that?\" said Margaret, she thought she'd heard Gail whisper something but wasn't sure. \"I said I wish Steph was here. Silly I know but I do wish it.\" Margaret smiled at her. \"Listen, love, there's no such thing as silly in this situation. Anyone got her number? Or any of the others? They should be told.\" \"I've already told her, rang her when I got the news!\" Gail is now sobbing uncontrollably. \"Ah\" said Cliff who instinctively understood. \"Well then,\" said Margaret, \"We'll get her here.\" \"Is that really what you want Gail?\" Asked Cliff. \"Of course she does, look at her.\" said Margaret. Sian said nothing but understood what was happening. She and Cliff had separately had suspicions about what was going on in Gail's mind regarding Steph. \"You two know don't you? I can see it in your faces!\" Gail virtually screamed. \"Know what?\" said Margaret, a little taken aback. Martin looked at Sian: \"What the...\" suddenly the penny dropped. He's not quite as sharp as his wife but he isn't stupid. Margaret's hand went over her mouth as she too realised what was going on. Then she grabbed Gail into a huge hug. \"Oh you poor girl, you poor poor girl.\" Dai walked up. \"Someone had better tell LGSM. They'll want to know.\" \"Seems like they've been told, Dai. First thing Gail did was ring Steph...\" replied Martin. \"Oh, I see.\" \"Do you?\" \"Well they were always friendly, I thought.\" \"Looks like...\" \"Yeah I do know. But I'll ring them anyway, make it official.\" said Dai, he turned to his wife \"Look after her will you? I think she should stay with us tonight.\" \"Of course.\" said Margaret. Maureen Barry had been isolated since the strike. No longer on the Welfare Committee, she was also quite bitter but when her boys came home early she was concerned. She'd lost her husband to the pit after all. \"It's Alan Pritchard.\" said Lee. \"Roof collapsed, buried.\" Johnny could barely get the words out. Maureen hugged them. Meanwhile Dai is on the phone talking to Gethin. \"You may already know, Gail phoned Steph...\" \"Yeah she's been on. She's wondering if she should go down.\" \"Well, yeah that is for her and Gail to decide.\" \"Ah.\" \"Yeah. Well I thought I'd better tell you, make it official so to speak...\" \"I don't suppose there is any news on Alan yet...\" \"No, but it doesn't look good. Still the rescue team got here quite quickly.\" They finish the phone call and Dai grabbd coats for him and Margaret. He then goes back to the pithead. When he got there he pulled Margaret to one side. \"Listen, I've spoken to Gethin in London. Steph is wondering if she should come down, could you talk to Gail? I want her to think before she decides.\" \"Yes.\" Margaret went back and pulled Gail to one side. \"Dai's spoken to Gethin. Steph is thinking of coming.\" Gail opened her mouth to speak but Margaret carried on. \"I want you to think before making a decision. I know it would be a comfort to have her here but most of the village either know or suspect.\" Gail couldn't believe her ears. \"Know what?\" \"That you're in love with her.\" Gail opened her mouth and shut it. Margaret continued: \"It is true I can see it on your face. Does Alan know?\" \"Things haven't been good for some years but I don't think he knows.\" \"OK, once this is over you need to tell him. He needs to know that.\" Gail paused before replying: \"What if he comes out of there disabled? How am I going to tell him then? Tell me that!\" \"If you don't it'll eat away at both of you. You'll end up worse than Maureen, do you want that?\" \"No I don't. Oh I don't know, I'll think about it. Thanks.\" They left to re-join the group. A few hours passed with no news. Hefina arrived in the van. \"Listen. I've got soup for everyone. Now who needs a coat fetching. Ah yes Gail I see you managed to grab yours before leaving. Now anyone rung London?\" Hefina was her usual practical self. \"Yes, I've spoken to Gethin.\" said Dai not wanting to reveal much in front of the whole crowd. \"Now then, that's the rest of them sorted, let's look after you.\" she said turning to Gail, her voice softening. \"Come here into the warm.\" she said pointing to the van, \"I've had the heating on.\" Gail meekly followed her into the van. \"Now love, have you told Steph.\" Hefina says now they were in the van. \"Don't tell me you know too!\" \"I've known since our trip to London. Who else knows?\" \"Dai, Margaret, Sian, Martin, Cliff and, well, it seems half the village!\" \"Oh, love. Have you told her, about today I mean.\" \"Yes, first thing I did after I got the news.\" \"Now if she comes down she can't stay with you, can she? Not with half the village knowing or suspecting...\" \"S'pose not!\" Gail was crying again. \"I'll talk to Sian, get something sorted out. She's clever, that one.\" A knock on the van. Hefina opened the door. Dai's face told them all they needed to know. The Slaughter House* had struck again. The rescue team had found Alan's lifeless body crushed under the rubble. There would be an inquiry of course but it seemed like a simple accident. * This was actually the nick-name of a colliery further south in the Dulais Valley called Cefn Coed which is now a museum.[Chapter 2] In London someone knocked on Steph's door, Joe answered. \"Phone call for Steph. Some Welsh woman!\" \"OK I'll get it.\" Joe picked up the receiver on the communal pay phone. \"Steph is in the bath. I'll take a message\" \"Joe! Hi have you heard about Alan?\" Joe was not surprised to hear Sian's voice. \"Awful news.\" \"Yeah well, there'll be a funeral.\" \"He's dead?\" \"Yes. Thing is, Gail wants Steph to come down as soon as she can. But the situation is a bit delicate.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Do I need to spell it out?\" \"Well they are friendly but I am with Martin...\" \"There's a bit more to it than that.\" Suddenly Joe understood. He was still a bit naive, but not stupid. \"Oh!\" \"So I was wondering if you'd come with her?\" \"If you think it'll help then yes of course, and anyway it'd be good to see you all.\" \"Yes, it'd be good to see you too, sad though!\" \"Yeah, sorry, give my condolences to Gail.\" \"No need to be sorry love.\" \"I'll talk to Steph when she's out of the bath...\" \"OK love\" \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" They put the phones down. Joe went back to the room he shared with Steph. He sat down and thought. It was a good job he was moving into that other room in the building. Gail and Steph would need privacy. Or maybe Steph would move to Wales... Steph got out of the bath and went to her room with her robe on. She dressed in front of Joe. \"Sian phoned. Alan's dead. Gail wants you to go down but it is a bit awkward.\" \"Awkward?...\" \"Yeah what with you two being in love and half the village suspecting...\" \"Oh.\" Steph sank slowly into a chair. \"So Sian thinks it'd be a good idea if I came too.\" \"That cover was for your parents. I don't think it'll work in Wales.\" Steph laughed despite the seriousness of the situation. \"I think it is that there is more than one LGSM person. Not just you.\" \"Oh yeah, could work.\" Steph was suddenly serious and solemn. \"We'll be staying with Sian.\" \"Yeah, leave tomorrow morning?\" \"That's the plan.\" Meanwhile in Onllwyn Margaret was consoling Gail. Dai walked in. \"That was Sian, on the phone like, Staph is coming down tomorrow with Joe. Sian thought it'd be better if Joe came too...\" Gail nodded, understanding. Margaret smiled at Dai. \"The Coroner has released the body as the cause of death is obvious so you'll need to register the death. And take a certificate to the mines office to claim widow's pension. You'll get it for life. Why don't you do that tomorrow morning, it'll give you the chance to meet Steph and Joe from the train. We can talk about the funeral later.\" \"Will I need to take anything with me to the council and the mines office?\" \"Alan's birth certificate and your marriage certificate.\" \"I don't think I can face the house.\" \"Tell me where they are and I'll get them.\" Gail gave him the house keys and told him where to find everything. \"Thanks Dai. You know that look you two just exchanged? I never understood it until I met Steph..\" Gail slept fitfully that night. She felt a mix of emotions that was overwhelming. She'd married at sixteen. Alan had proposed and she'd accepted. Life for an unmarried woman was difficult in the valleys and she'd grabbed the first chance she could without finding out who she was. She knew she ought to give herself a bit of time now. But Steph... Next Morning Sian and Gail waited in the van at Neath railway station, at 10am a train from London pulled in. Steph and Joe got off the train and onto the platform. Steph was obviously nervous so Joe held her hand. They got into the van, Joe in the front, Steph joined Gail in the back. Steph and Gail hugged. \"You OK?\" Steph asked. \"I am now.\" replied Gail. \"Now, we need to go to the council, to deal with some paperwork and then the mines office.\" said Sian. By the time they were back in Onllwyn Steph and Gail had had a chat not minding Sian and Joe in the front of the van. They had decided a few things, firstly that Gail would stay in Onllwyn until after the funeral. Then she would tell everyone that she was going to take a holiday, to help her get over Alan's death. What she'd actually do was to stay with Steph to see if they had a chance of working. They got out of the van and Dai greeted them, the pit was closed until the safety team had cleared away the debris and made the seam safe.. \"All done then?\" he asked. \"Just the funeral to organise now.\" said Sian \"Where is the undertakers?\" asked Joe. \"Neath but we can organise that over the phone.\" Sian replied. \"Right now one of you two needs to ring Gethin, tell him you got here safely.\" \"That reminds me, the inquiry will open tomorrow.\" said Dai. They all went to Sian's house. \"Steph, I'll ring Gethin!\" said Joe. \"Gail, why don't you go and help Steph unpack.\" said Sian. While Joe was ringing Gethin downstairs Gail and Steph were upstairs. \"OK now, how are you really?\" Steph asked when they were alone. \"This is going to sound terrible, but all I feel is relief... I suppose I am sad that he's gone. But right now I wish it was me getting on the train to London this morning to start up life with you.\" \"I hope you're not expecting anything as grand as Jonathon and Gethin's place. I've got one room with shared kitchen, bathroom, and toilet. Not even my own phone.\" said Steph. \"As long as we're together. But I'll have some money, maybe we could look for somewhere.\" said Gail. \"I take it you haven't looked at London prices...\" \"Well I did notice the beer was pricey...\" Steph smiles. \"We'll be lucky to find a rabbit hutch for what you'd get for a house here.\" \"Oh. But all your friends are there.\" \"So? Your friends are here.\" \"Not all of them.\" Gail smiled. \"True. And some of mine are.\" \"Then there's work, I'll need to find something. Nothing round here for women. I don't know: I just think London will be easier for us.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, you lot coming in is one thing, me turning lesbian is quite another.\" \"I just don't want you to burn your bridges here.\" \"I might not even be able to sell the house if the pit closes.\" \"OK then. I give in.\" There was a knock on the front door. Sian opened it to find Gwen on the doorstep. \"One of my lesbians is here! Where is she?\" Gwen almost couldn't get the words out in her excitement. \"You see the problem?\" Gail said to Steph, \"Round here we'll be either total goddesses or demons. I want to be human.\" Gwen's hearing is better than her age would normally indicate \"Is that Gail's voice? I always knew she shouldn't have married that idiot!\" \"Oh God another one knows!\" Gail whispered to Steph. \"Maybe it is time to brazen it out?\" Steph whispered back. Steph took Gail's hand and lead her downstairs. Gail pulled Steph back and kissed her. \"Yeah you're right!\" Gail said in her normal voice as she released Steph's lips. ","Summary":" A/N Usual disclaimer applies, Pride doesn't belong to me. It belongs to the brilliant Stephen Beres"},{"Movie":"Bride and Prejudice","Title":"Bride & Prejudice Redux","Author":"Tripp3235","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6645432","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I recently watched Bride and Prejudice for the first time. I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, and while this movie did have its weaknesses, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did have issue with a couple of moments. The first was with the dream sequence. I know that Bollywood movies they are forbidden to kiss, but not so in fanfiction . I altered the dream sequence shown here to have what I find much more interesting. The other part and what this FF will primarily focus on, is the days after Lalita meets Darcy's mother. I felt it was too soon for Darcy to ask Lalita out to dinner by themselves and then I'd like to replace the Bollywood montage sequence (to show they are falling in love) with actual scenes of them falling in love. This is an older movie so I don't expect anyone to even notice I posted, but if you read, please comment. I'd appreciate it. Lalita smiled as she walked up the aisle, her groom stood proudly as she approached. Even through the heavy lace in the American style veil, she could see the handsome features of Johnny. Though she hadn't known him that long, his charm, good looks and sensitive side made her sure he was the right choice. He was the right man for her. At the altar, she beamed another smile at him which Johnny returned. She gasped as he reached out to pull up her veil. Her heart raced as she watched the material slowly rise up, ready to see him without hindrance. She stared at his chest, slowly lifting her gaze over the materials in the tuxedo, to his chin looking strong and determined. But in an actual blink of an eye, Lalita felt horror overcome her. No longer was Johnny's pleasing face before her, but Darcy's. That face which held contempt for her and her country. She felt fear overtake her, she wasn't marrying Johnny at all, but Darcy! How did this happen? She screamed as loudly as she could, but no one did anything, especially Darcy who stood by looking confused. She ran away, she had to get away from him. Running through the door to the outside where the beautiful sunshine had turned to a horrible rainstorm. She didn't care about getting wet, she'd run through fire to get away from him! But now he was before her, grabbing her arm as she tried to run away. He turned her around to face him. She struggled in his arms, what did he think he was doing? She stopped, tired; the rain making it harder to see. As she calmed down, she realized she was very close to him. Closer than she ever had been. Their faces were mere inches apart. She wanted to tell him to let her go, to leave her alone. SHE HATED HIM! But when she tried to speak, no words came out. He took the opportunity to brush his lips to hers. She expected his lips to feel cold, but they were warm and wet, probably from the rain. He kissed her again, this time longer. Darcy's body heat felt so good and Lalita relaxed in his arms. She began to give in to the pleasure, groaning out his name… Lalita jerked out of the bed. It took a second to realize she was no longer kissing Darcy but in her bed in her parent's house. Looking around, she realized it was still the middle of the night, moonlight streaming into her bedroom. Pushing the hair out of her face, she let her eyes adjust. Looking into the mirror in her bedroom, she stared at herself, wondering why of all men, Darcy would be the object of such an intense dream? Leaning her head into her hands, she slowed her breathing, hoping it would slow down her heart, which was still racing. Licking her lips, the dream still felt very real.[Chapter 2] Chapter One Jaya turned to her sister, \"It's you he wants to eat with, you know, the rest of us are just there to…\" \"So I have someone to talk to,\" Lalita finished. They were waiting for Darcy to arrive to pick them up. He had invited them to dinner along with his sister, Georgie. Lalita had accepted more out of the inability to come up with a reasonable excuse not to go, his offer coming so out of the blue. Jaya smiled, \"He's not that bad. He was charming today actually.\" Her sister shook her head, \"I'm sure it's just his business face, like Kohli saying they now had the home court advantage.\" \"You didn't seem to mind so much. Honestly Lalita, you insist you can't stand him but when you're around him, you're quite receptive to…\" \"To what?\" Lalita asked not liking what Jaya was implying. \"To him.\" As if that explained everything. Snorting, Lalita dismissed such an idea. \"Now you're sounding like Chandra. She's always seemed to notice Darcy's attentions and loved the idea of the two of us…\" Just then Darcy's convertible pulled into the driveway, momentarily stopping Lalita from speaking. She was beginning to wonder if everyone in LA had a convertible. Saying goodbye to the family, they walked outside to greet them. Darcy and his sister were getting out of the car. \"Hi,\" Darcy said, looking more than a little nervous. \"You know, we do have some time before our reservations if you want to sit here for a while…\" That would only give Chandra a chance to grill Darcy about his intentions, so Lalita shook her head. \"No, they are in the middle of…something. Let's just go.\" Anything to get this night over and done. \"Fine by me,\" Georgie said, beaming, \"I'm starving.\" With that, she hopped in the backseat where Jaya joined her, forcing Lalita to take the front seat next to Darcy. As they drove away, Jaya asked, \"So where are we going?\" Georgina said, \"My brother wants it to be a surprise.\" Glancing over at Darcy, Lalita looked to see if he would let on about where they were headed. He just smiled, and before she could stop herself, she returned it. Turning her head so Jaya couldn't see, Lalita berated herself for whatever was going on lately between them. Just because Darcy made a long International flight pleasant did not undo all his past behavior. The rudeness may have been gone, but he was still arrogant and rich. Not that she had a problem with his money, it just seemed to create an entitled attitude, which definitely turned her off. Of course, Lalita had never dreamed how much money he actually had, until she saw the LA hotel and met his mother. Thinking of Mrs. Darcy made Lalita twitch with irritation. Noticing, Darcy asked, \"You comfortable? Are you cold?\" Glancing over at him, she said no. She realized then that Darcy was drumming his fingers on the steering wheel. Obviously he was nervous. He had been earlier at lunch too, though Lalita had no doubt it had more to do with his mother. She had never witnessed such a display of contempt for others, which even extended to her own children. The way she spoke to both Darcy and Georgie irritated Lalita. Had she always treated them this way? Was Darcy's father like her too? His mother had made a snide remark about Darcy taking after him that was said in such a way it was obvious she didn't approve. But judging by Mrs. Darcy's own behavior and what she disapproved of, it only spoke well of the senior Darcy. They arrived at a Mexican restaurant called Casa Vista . The place, though certainly nice, didn't have the sophistication and airs Lalita had expected to be taken. She felt a little overdressed. \"I'm glad Will wanted to come here,\" Georgie said. \"I've never been to India but I wanted you guys to experience Mexican style food. It's delicious, especially here in California.\" Jaya and Lalita walked in. Everyone had smiles on their faces and a mariachi band was playing to the side. The hostess, a plump Mexican woman, smiled when she saw them enter. \"Senor Darcy! Oh, and Senorita Georgina! I'm so glad to see you back in town!\" Darcy smiled and to Lalita's shock, kissed the older woman on the cheek. \"Angela! I didn't think you would be working so late! \" The older woman laughed and gestured for them to follow her. \"Oh, I saw your name down on the reservation list. Haven't seen you in so long; I had to stay and see my favorite customer!\" Lalita continued listening to the exchange. Did Darcy pay this woman to talk him up so? But his attitude with her seemed so sincere. Darcy's smile had never faltered since walking in, probably the longest Darcy had gone wearing one. Lalita couldn't stop staring, while she always had to admit he was a handsome man, a genuine smile with laughter made a remarkable difference. When he turned his eyes to her, Lalita could feel herself blushing again. \"Have you two been to a Mexican place before?\" he asked. Jaya answered first, \"It's the first time I've been, but I think Lalita has been before, when we were in London.\" Darcy's face fell so Lalita wanted to explain. \"Well, yes, but it was a long time ago and it's certainly a different environment in England. This was..your idea to come here?\" She still couldn't believe he would like such a place. \"Yeah, well, I wanted to make sure you guys got the full cultural experience. But of course, it didn't occur to me that Kohli might have taken you to a place like this already. I'm sorry, I should have asked.\" His humility unnerved Lalita more than his laughter did. She started to tell him it was ok but found her mouth was dry. Thankful for the water the waiter had just brought, Lalita drank it. Time passed and the meal had long been eaten. His nerves wouldn't let him fully relax, yet Darcy was really enjoying himself. Though not as shy as himself, Jaya was much more talkative than she ever had been, and Georgina's presence took the pressure off. As if in direct opposition, Lalita said little, but she was smiling and laughing out loud to which he took to be a good sign. Thanks to Georgie, he knew how to read Lalita's body language better, and felt confident that he was managing to undo the damage he had done in India. Of course, it wasn't easy taking dating advice from his baby sister. But Darcy knew he had a real second chance with Lalita, and didn't want to screw it up. He had filled Georgie in about Lalita long before that day, the good with the bad. Georgie did idolize her brother for many things, but knew he had a hard time in mixed company and she had guessed being in a foreign country had made things all the worse for him. Earlier that day, after they separated from Lalita's family, Darcy was completely confused about how to feel. He could tell Lalita had warmed to him some, but she also might have just been polite. He'd worried about his mother around them, but Lalita standing her ground made him admire her all the more. She had defended her opinions in a respectful way, without taking it too far like he would have. Georgie had also been impressed with Lalita. She noticed Lalita's attentions to Darcy but felt the Indian woman was keeping her distance. Georgina was a little worried she had been a little too pushy selling her brother, she adored him that sometimes she forgot not everyone could see his big heart. A round of drinks had been ordered. Darcy raised his hand in a toast manner, gesturing to Lalita, \"Here's to the only person I've seen stand up to my mother.\" Lalita looked embarrassed. \"I hope I wasn't too rude.\" Georgie laughed, \"It's good for her.\" She smiled and Darcy felt the need to go on. \"It reminded me of being in India. There I was, trying to figure what was going on, and you were jumping down my throat.\" \"You deserved it,\" she said. Darcy felt a slight kick under the table and he glanced at his sister. This was a sign they had decided to use and he realized Lalita's manner which had relaxed over dinner, was now back to the formal tone she took many times when they first met. Clearing his throat, he decided to be honest, \"I know I can be thoughtless at times, especially when I'm nervous. Let me say, I never intentionally meant to be insulting or offensive.\" He stopped there, staring at her. She had cast her eyes down at the table, her face unreadable. After a beat, she raised them and they stared for what seemed like an eternity. He didn't realize he was holding his breath until Jaya spoke, \"The band is good.\" \"Hmmm,\" Darcy nodded, grabbing a quick sip of his margarita. Glancing back over at Lalita, he saw her eyes were still on him. Not able to resist, he pointed to her, \"Why don't you show them how it's done.\" \"Oh, no, no.\" Again her eyes cut down. Was she blushing? Feeling playful, Darcy joked, \"Well, you know, I guess your guitar playing can't really compare to your sister's snake dance.\" The three laughed, leaving poor Georgina in the dark. \"What?\" \"Their sister does this awesome snake dance.\" Again, Georgina's bewildered expression left them to laugh some more. Jaya and Lalita quickly filled the younger woman in about the entertainment that happened at dinner a couple of months earlier. \"Well,\" Georgie said, smiling, \"sorry I missed that. I will have to look that up when I return to class in the fall.\" \"Oh that's right,\" Lalita said. \"You're in school. What are you studying?\" \"Music,\" Georgie said. \"Though not guitar I'm afraid.\" Lalita glanced over at Darcy, \"I wouldn't think so. \" \"Actually my favorite is the composition classes but I do love the piano.\" \"She should,\" Darcy said proudly, \"someday she's going to be a famous concert pianist.\" Georgie ignored him. \"Music is something that gives me such joy. I do admit my dream is to travel the world in concert but let's just make sure I graduate first.\" Jaya said, \"That's great you have an opportunity to take a gift you love and dedicate your life to it.\" \"Do you study here?\" Lalita asked. \"No, in New York at Julliard.\" \"That's a prestigious school,\" Lalita said, \"Of course, with your family money you can afford to go to go to the best…\" \"Actually,\" Georgina interrupted, \"I'm on scholarship. My mother wasn't keen on me taking this direction with my life and so it's been something I've had to do on my own.\" Lalita didn't respond immediately. After a few moments of silence, Jaya said, \"But a scholarship to Julliard is a real accomplishment. It speaks a great deal of your talent.\" \"Like I said, she's going to be a famous concert pianist someday.\" He honestly did believe it. \"Admittedly it's a part scholarship. But Will picks up the rest on his own money, and he helped me get a job so I can pay for my room and board.\" Darcy blushed, hoping it didn't seem like they were showing off again. He had been furious with his mother for not seeing his sister's talents and allowing her to pursue a dream she had a real chance at, but he had to admit despite objections, Georgie now had a better grasp of living in the real world and he knew she wasn't the same sheltered girl the Wickhams of this world could take advantage of. The conversation had gradually moved to education in India. Darcy enjoyed listening to what life was like for the Bakshi sisters growing up. Before long, they realized the restaurant was half empty and it was very late. As they were leaving, Angela had brought them a dessert, from the back, on the house. She wanted Lalita and Jaya to take some back to their house. Heading out to the car, Darcy held the plate while the women got in. He noticed that Lalita didn't seem to mind sitting in the front seat this time. He waited as she got situated, and putting the seat belt on before he handed the food to her. Though she had a firm hold on the plate, he didn't immediately let it go, but held it until she looked at him. He had leaned in closely and whispered, \"Hold it tight, I'd hate for it to spill on you and ruin that beautiful dress.\" He then walked to the other side and got in. The ride back home was quiet. Looking at the rear mirror, he could tell his sister and Jaya were very tired. The full meal and the late night were getting to them. Glancing at Lalita, Darcy quietly said, \"What are your plans tomorrow?\" He apparently interrupted her thoughts as Lalita jumped at the sound of his voice. \"Hmm? Oh, we were going to do more sight-seeing. Kohli can't take us so it will just be my sisters and me.\" \"Where are you thinking of going?\" \"Well,\" Lalita said, \"Lakhi may overrule me, but I'd love to go to the Natural History Museum.\" \"Oh, that's Will's favorite museum! He could give you a tour!\" Piped up Georgina in the back, her fatigue clearly removing any subtlety for helping out her brother. \"Yes, well I'm not sure…\" Jaya cut her sister off. \"No, I want to go too. Do you think you could take us tomorrow morning? Lakhi can stand to see more museums and less beaches and shops.\" \"Sure, I would be honored to,\" Darcy said while he pulled into the driveway. \"Let me help you out of the car since you have that dish.\" Jumping out, he ran over to help Lalita out. As he handed the dessert back, she said \"Thank you.\" It might have been his imagination but she lingered longer than was necessary. As he watched the two women walk to the door, he called back, probably too eagerly. \"So I'll pick you up at nine?\" He was desperate for Lalita to give him some sign she was glad he was joining them, but it was Jaya who turned and answered that was fine. Not willing to let it get him down, Darcy got back in the car while his sister remained in the back seat. \"Well I am going to concentrate on the positive. In India Lalita would have made up an excuse not to go tomorrow. The fact she remained silent is definitely a step in the right direction, right?\" \"Right, big brother.\" Georgie said smiling. As Darcy pulled out of the driveway, he couldn't see Georgie's face or he would have asked about her continued smile. What she saw that he didn't was Lalita remained at the door watching them drive away in the shadows, still holding that plate.[Chapter 3] Chapter Two \"Is Lakhi not ready yet? Darcy will be here in 20 minutes.\" Lalita said as nonchalantly as she possibly could. The younger woman emerged from the bathroom, still wearing her pajamas. \"I'm not going. I don't care about museums.\" \"Big surprise,\" Lalita said rolling her eyes. To be truthful she was relieved. Her sister was a handful and would make no effort to keep her mouth from complaining the entire time. Just then, Jaya came out of the bedroom. She was dressed, but not to go out in public. Lalita eyed her sister suspiciously, \"Why are you dressed like that?\" \"Um,\" Jaya said, \"I'm not feeling well. I think you better go without me.\" \"What?\" Lalita did not buy it. Jaya was as bad as Chandra. \"You expect me to go with him by myself?\" \"Jaya said you probably wanted to be with him on your own last night.\" Lakhi got an elbow to her ribs. Lalita shook her head a little too forcefully. \"I did not. And just because Darcy was being charming last night…\" \"Go Lalita, have a good time. You're into museums more than the rest of us anyway. And if Georgina was telling the truth about Darcy's love for them, he'll be an excellent gui-\" \"Why wouldn't she be telling the truth?\" Lalita asked, glaring at her two sisters. \"Why does everyone keep pushing us together? I'm not interested like that…\" Just then the doorbell rang downstairs. Lakhi glanced out the window to see Darcy's car. \"He's here.\" \"He's early,\" Lalita hissed. Jaya couldn't resist, \"Probably can't wait to see you!\" She earned a glare from her sister for her trouble. Chandra welcomed Darcy inside. Lalita knew she better get down there or Chandra would ask him to stay. Walking down the stairs, Darcy and Chandra looked up to see her. Darcy's blushed while saying, \"Good morning, Lalita.\" Feeling her face match his, she returned the greeting. Getting a good look at her friend, Chandra couldn't hold back her giant smile, \"Why, Lalita, don't you look beautiful this morning? Is that a new outfit?\" \"No,\" Lalita said, upset with her friend's teasing. \"Um, you're early.\" \"Yeah, I'm sorry. Traffic was much lighter than I expected. If you're not ready I could wait in the car.\" Lalita had to giggle a little at his nervousness. \"No, don't be silly. We can go.\" As they walked out the door, the three women chimed in perfect unison, \"Have a good time!\" Darcy was about to turn to say something, but Lalita held out her hand. \"Ignore them.\" The ride to the museum was quiet at first until Lalita remarked on the traffic. Darcy had a lot to say on the subject, but in an amusing way. She reminded him of the traffic in India which he remembered well. Darcy's sincere feelings on how lost he felt there gave Lalita pause to remember her own treatment of Darcy was not exactly welcoming. At the museum, Lalita was very surprised that Darcy was indeed a big fan of the Natural History Museum. He'd obviously been there several times and even had knowledge of the architecture of the building. His lively spirit in explaining what he knew, though not in a condescending way, was almost boyish in nature. Lalita found herself laughing out loud at his liveliness, which may have confused him but was no deterrent. They spent a lot of time in the dinosaur section. As they went from display to display, Lalita found herself asking Darcy about his love for the museum. \"Oh, well, when I was younger my farther would take me here and the ones in London. Back then, well I was a boy and other than the dinosaurs, I didn't really care. He would rattle on, I guess the way I'm doing now and I'd just shrug.\" She nodded, smiling at the image of a young Darcy. \"But you came to love it.\" Darcy's face fell slightly, \"Yeah, well…not really in time though.\" \"In time?\" She was surprised at the sudden sadness on his face. Glancing at her, he looked to be struggling about whether to say anything. She waited until he relented. \"When my father died, I was a teenager. I…he never gave up his love for museums even though I found excuses for him not to take me anymore. Anyway, in London after the funeral I went to the Museum of London by myself. I felt a very deep connection I hadn't felt when he was alive. A little too late.\" Darcy's face held such regret and sadness, Lalita reached out her hand to caress his arm. The touch had him come out of his melancholy state and return to the present. \"Sorry, didn't mean to turn negative all of a sudden.\" \"No, no, that was a tragic moment in your history and at such a young age. I can't imagine…I love my father and if I lost him even now…\" \"Yeah, I liked your father. He seemed to favor you.\" They sat down at a nearby bench. Smiling, Lalita shook her head. \"He would never say I was a favorite but it's true he and I get along better than the rest of my sisters, though Jaya comes in very close. If he was gone, I think I'd be shattered.\" \"It's tough, but you carry through. For the love of your family.\" Lalita knew he was talking about his sister. \"If you were a teenager, then Georgina must have been a little girl.\" He nodded. \"Yes, she was but she was old enough to understand which I think made it all the harder. And you met my mother so it wasn't like we were first on her mind.\" \"Yeah,\" Lalita said, feeling more disdain for Mrs. Darcy than ever. She reached for his arm again and squeezed. \"Looks like you did a good job with Georgina in spite of, and she obviously adores you.\" \"Thank you.\" Darcy was staring into her eyes. They were hypnotic and she couldn't think of anything else she wanted to say. His other hand came over Lalita's. She enjoyed the warmth of his touch. He then began rubbing her hand in small circular motions. The sensations made her heart race but once Lalita came to her senses, she gently took her hand away. Standing up, she said with a hoarse throat, \"We better keep going. Remember I want to meet my family for lunch.\" \"Right.\" Darcy replied. The morning went by faster than either could imagine. Darcy asked if she wanted to get coffee before her lunch. When she agreed, he realized he'd been holding his breath. As they waited for their coffee, Darcy reflected on the wonderful morning they had. Or he thought it was wonderful. His excitement over sharing his love for the museum wasn't fake, and the fact she was so responsive made him enjoy himself all the more. They had far more in common than one would think since they grew up on opposite sides of the world. And she was so easy to talk to, even on the hardest of subjects. Darcy could kick himself for not trying harder in India to get to know her. After getting their coffees, Darcy found a booth that was out of the main crowd, making it easier to talk. \"How's your cappuccino?\" He cringed inwardly at the lame question. \"It's good.\" She took a sip. \"I'm not used to so much foam on the top.\" \"Yeah, well, that way they can serve less and make more.\" She smiled knowingly. \"Yes, I'm sure they do.\" \"It's the American way.\" He said shyly. \"Well,\" she said reflectively, \"I think you'll find everywhere in the world they try to do the same.\" \"Yeah. Pretty much. Um, how do you like America so far?\" Lalita seemed to consider his question, and Darcy felt his heart dip. What if she hated it? All at once he understood far better how his dismissive attitude on her country's long held customs must have felt to her. However, her response was positive. \"Actually I do like it here. It's different. And I know LA is just one part of the country, so I wish I had time to see more. We're only here for another week.\" Was that a hint of regret in her eyes? Darcy wasn't sure. He was about to say something else when Lalita went on, \"Maybe with my best friend living here, I can come again in the future.\" \"I'd like that,\" Darcy said before he could stop himself. Lalita's reaction made him blush. \"Anyway, I hope you enjoyed your tour of the Natural History Museum. Was your tour satisfactory?\" She smiled, \"Very.\" \"And was the guide informative, charming and delightful?\" Her giggle was music to Darcy's ears. \"Maybe. Just a little.\" \"Excellent! The audience was very captivating, making it difficult to speak about the exhibits.\" She grew quiet at his comment and Darcy worried he'd messed up again. How did he always find the wrong thing to say? But one look into her eyes and he then realized maybe, finally, he said the very right thing. Just then, his cell phone rang. He tried to ignore it, but Lalita told him it was fine. Apologizing he took the call. He listened as his assistant explained the issue and he realized he was going to have to go in. Hanging up the phone, he never felt such hatred for his job than he did at that moment. \"I'm so sorry. I'm afraid I'll have to go to work. There is this problem…\" \"Don't worry; you've been so kind to give up so much of your time as it is.\" The disappointment on her face was there, but it oddly did little to appease him; in fact it made him feel worse. As they walked out, Lalita checked her watch. \"Actually this is good timing. I should be meeting my family soon for lunch, then onto our own site seeing tour.\" They got to his car, and she told him what restaurant they were to meet them. As they drove, Darcy asked, \"You don't sound too excited about more LA site seeing.\" She shrugged. \"Yes, well. We've been to all the typical hot spots. It's fine. They want to go to the beach. I'm sure California beaches are beautiful but I had hoped to see something different or unusual. I feel like…I don't know, I want to see everything but with our tourist guide book and maps carrying our cameras, it feels so generic. Plus we have another day of it in the morning.\" \"I know what you mean, I think.\" He said thinking. He could feel her eyes on him, \"This morning was different. I really did enjoy myself.\" He laughed. \"So I'm a better tour guide than Kohli?\" She returned his laugh. \"Yes, very much.\" \"High praise indeed.\" He waited a beat then ventured an idea. \"You know, I'm not sure if you would be interested, but I might be able to make the site seeing for you and your family a little more exciting. I think…I mean I have an idea. Would you be up for it?\" She was staring at him. \"What do you have in mind?\" \"Oh,\" He had to grin mischievously, \"I'd rather not say. But I promise it to be quite over the top, that is, if you would allow me to be. If you think it would be alright for the morning that is. I'm afraid there is nothing I can do about this afternoon.\" She was silent for a few moments, then responded. \"So tomorrow, will you be there?\" He didn't dare look at her but her tone sounded hopeful. \"Would you like me there?\" She waited a beat before she answered which nearly killed him. \"Yes.\" \"Well, then I'll pick you guys up in the morning with a chance to see LA like few do.\" She agreed. Dropping her off, Darcy knew he had a lot to do if he was going to pull this off.[Chapter 4] Chapter Three The next morning everyone was surprisingly ready for Darcy when he arrived. Apparently his promise of something unexpected excited the whole Bakshi family, even Mrs Bakshi. It was evident to Lalita that there would be no last minute excuses to stay home, which left her oddly disappointed. \"You think he's taking us to Hollywood?\" Lakhi wondered. Lalita certainly hoped Darcy had more imagination than that. Darcy drove up, this time in an SUV, which offered plenty of room for them all to fit comfortably. When Mrs. Bakshi took the front passenger seat, Lalita was momentarily caught off guard. In the back of her mind she had envisioned sitting up front with Darcy. She felt a little let down as she got into the back. \"So where are you taking us?\" Lakhi asked, not wanting to wait any longer. Darcy chuckled. \"I thought I'd take you to the zoo.\" \"The zoo?\" Mrs. Bakshi answered, sounding as disappointed as Lakhi looked. Lalita made eye contact with Darcy through the rear mirror on the dashboard. A quick wink to her made it quite clear he was teasing. Lalita smiled at him. Several minutes into the drive it was clear he was not taking them to the zoo. Again, the youngest and oldest Bakshi members tried to pump Darcy for answers, but he wasn't spilling. Eventually he took them out of the city. When they arrived at their destination, it was evident what was going to happen. \"A helicopter!\" Jaya exclaimed. \"Oh, I've always wanted to go on one!\" \"Me too!\" Lakhi said, waiting for the car to stop before getting out, all thoughts of Hollywood were forgotten. Darcy walked to the other side of the car, where Lalita sat. His look was anxious, seeking approval. \"What do you think? Is this different enough?\" Beaming, Lalita nodded. \"I hardly know what to say.\" Mrs. Bakshi pointed in the direction of the main office. \"I think we go in here, that sign says something about starting line on tours.\" \"Sorry, no,\" Darcy said, stopping the older woman. \"We're going to, um, get a little different tour. We just walk around here.\" They followed Darcy around the building to a more private area. Someone was waving at them, and Darcy waved back. The man was in his forties with a deep tan. His smile to Darcy was genuine and big. They reached out and grasped each other's hands. Darcy made introductions, and Lalita learned this was Brad Wright. He had been friends with Darcy's father a long time ago and still kept in contact as much as he can. He owned the helicopter touring business. \"When Will asked me if I could possibly find a free chopper today to fly you guys around, I said on one condition! That I do the flying.\" Everyone laughed. Brad took them to a flight of stairs; apparently their copter was on a raised platform. As it emerged before their eyes, Lalita felt like she was dreaming. She had never thought in a million years she would ever get to do something like this. \"You okay?\" Darcy noticed she hadn't said much. \"Yes, I still can't believe this. Honestly, how can we ever repay you for something…\" He stopped her by touching her arm, \"Please, I want to do this. Besides, Brad is a friend and was more generous than I expected.\" A silence fell on them as they gazed at each other. Neither noticed that the rest of the family was getting buckled in. Finally, Brad interrupted the moment when he slapped Darcy on the back, breaking the spell. \"So, Lalita, I must tell you, that I've known this guy since he was born. And there isn't enough money in the world to stop me from telling some stories about him.\" \"Brad,\" Darcy said through clenched teeth. Lalita answered, \"There isn't enough money in the world to stop me from listening.\" \"Great,\" she heard Darcy mutter, making her giggle. The flight went all over the city, taking much longer than the normal one hour tours. They saw beaches, canyons, downtown LA, and to Lakhi's delight a distant Hollywood with some celebrity homes thrown in. But what Lalita enjoyed the most was Brad's stories of Darcy. She heard a variety of them: when he was very little and would dance naked out by the pool; When he got his diploma at Oxford, he tripped going up the steps , knocking the microphone down. By the time Brad set the helicopter down on a private beach, Darcy looked as if he had wanted to bury himself in the sand. Brad walked to the back and began unloading things from the chopper. Jaya asked what was going on now. \"Well,\" Brad answered, \"I'm sure you are hungry so I have lunch for us. You can't come to Southern LA and not picnic at the beach.\" Again, everyone was shocked and glanced at Darcy who still hadn't recovered from Brad's stories of him. \"Well, I thought we better eat and we could hardly go through a drive thru window.\" As everyone helped to set things up, Brad walked up behind Lalita. \"So, are you enjoying the stories of Will?\" She laughed, \"Very much so. You have more to share?\" Brad glanced at Darcy who was helping take out some food and set up with Jaya and Lakhi. \"I do, but he might go into cardiac arrest if I tell anymore.\" \"I am sure he will live. Besides he owes you for all of this trouble.\" \"Actually I owe him,\" Brad said, suddenly becoming serious. \"A few years ago my business fell on hard times and I was going to have to fold. Will heard about it and insisted on helping me out, not just with money but overlooking my books to find out what exactly happened before. To this day he still won't let me pay him back.\" The affection in Brad's voice was clear. Lalita let her eyes glide over to Darcy, now placating her mother by trying to remove the sand from the blankets they were using to sit on. Brad walked away but Lalita remained standing in place. Was this the same man who had insulted her country and traditions just a mere six weeks earlier? She had taken him to be a thoughtless and offensive man whose pride gave him an exalted sense of self worth. But every moment gave her new evidence that chipped away at the impression, that image. \"Lalita, you coming to eat?\" Mrs. Bakshi asked. \"Yes.\" Lalita choked out. Darcy sat finishing his lunch. Lalita had grown quiet again. Brad had spent the entire meal talking, though thankfully about himself and the area this time. He had a knack for telling stories and as long as they weren't about him, Darcy could relax and enjoy spending time with Lalita's family. Lalita kept sneaking glances at him. Of course, he was sneaking glances at her. But this time it seemed different. She was in thought, as if considering something. While he had been wrong before, he had a gut feeling this was a good thing. Maybe she was finally realizing that he wasn't as bad as her first impression led her to believe. Jaya broke into his thoughts, \"We really can't begin to thank you, both of you, for this wonderful day.\" Everyone agreed and it was time to start cleaning up. Darcy found Lalita rushed to help him gather the blankets. As they folded them, they walked towards each other and eventually came face to face. Darcy knew he could never get tired gazing into her eyes. \"Jaya is right, today was wonderful and you really outdid yourself.\" Blushing, Darcy didn't think he could take all the credit. \"Well, Brad did most of the work. He got the chopper ready, prepared and brought the food, and flew us here. I just came along for the ride.\" \"You did more than that.\" Her voice was a whisper. Darcy's eyes fell on her lips. They were just inches away. Before he could do anything about it, Lakhi interrupted. \"Lalita, we need those blankets!\" Lalita rushed away so quickly Darcy wondered if he had imagined the moment. The flight back was quiet for everyone, even Brad. Still, the novelty of flying had not worn off Jaya, Lakhi and Mrs. Bakshi. They had their eyes fixed to the ground trying to see spot known landmarks or celebrities. Lalita and Darcy, who were facing one another, kept their eyes trained on each other as if there was nothing else to look to. After they landed, Darcy tried to talk payment but Brad wouldn't hear of it. He kept winking at Lakhi who was giggling at him. \"Just spending time with pretty women is payment enough.\" This gave Mrs. Bakshi an opportunity for the sake of Jaya who she wanted married first. \"Oh, now did you know my eldest Jaya is not seeing anyone, and if you would like to come by the house later…\" Immediately Lalita and Jaya yelled at their mother to stop, mortified. Darcy laughed, wondering if Mrs. Bakshi would ever give up in trying to marry off her daughters. Darcy had phone signal now and realized he had a few messages and had only enough time to drive the women back and head to the office. Though they loved the day, it was obvious they were worn out and welcomed to go back home. Darcy also noticed how sad Lalita looked. This fueled his courage to pull her to the side as everyone was getting in the car. \"Lalita, um, would you like to get together tonight?\" She wasn't quite facing him and he wondered if he had misread her. Quickly he added, \"I'd like to take you ice skating.\" The look on her face told Darcy that the suggestion was not what she expected. \"Ice skating? You skate?\" \"Well, um, about as well as I dance but I think it might be fun and if you were up to it…\" \"Are we going?\" Lakhi asked impatient as always. Darcy pulled out his keys, nodding in her direction. He started to walk away, when Lalita grabbed his arm, \"Wait, yes. I'd love to go skating tonight.\" Inwardly Darcy did a jump in the air screaming thank you. On the outside, he smiled politely and said, \"Great. Pick you up at eight.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter Four Darcy was holding the steering wheel so tight one could joke it might snap off. He snuck a peek at Lalita, who sat on the passenger seat looking out the window. He had told her to dress down, and even in jeans and a long sleeved T, she looked gorgeous. How was he ever going to be able to concentrate on not falling when she was beside him? \"So,\" he asked, \"have you ever been ice skating before?\" She turned to face him, smiling. \"No, I've always wanted to. It looks like fun.\" He nodded, \"It can be. When you're with the right person.\" Her silence at his last statement forced him to turn towards her. The look she was giving him made him blush. Forcing himself to concentrate, he pointed ahead, \"We're here.\" He had taken her to a Culver City ice rink which luckily was open on Thursday evenings after eight to the public. As he helped her out of the car, he realized he was almost shaking. There was no denying Lalita's feelings for him had changed and he suddenly felt like everything rested on tonight. Why in the world did he pick something that risked him falling down like a baby? Didn't he embarrass himself enough around her when he tried to dance? \"So you come here often?\" she asked as they went in and he rented their shoes. \"Um, not really. Georgina loves it here so we used to go a lot, more so when she was a kid. I thought though you might enjoy this. Or at the very least, laugh when I make a complete fool of myself.\" They sat down to put their skates on, \"I doubt you're that bad.\" \"If you thought I was bad dancing, well, this should be much much worse.\" He glanced over at the skaters who suddenly looked like Olympic hopefuls. \"You didn't dance that bad,\" she said quickly. Then she changed her mind, \"Okay, you were a little bit lost but at least you eventually tried. The day I met you, you hardly made the effort.\" He defended himself, \"Hey, I had a good reason not to dance that first time.\" She finished putting on her last skate. \"What was that?\" \"My pants were falling down.\" Darcy was concentrating so much on his attempt to stand with the skates, his tone was completely matter of fact. He didn't think about how it sounded until he noticed Lalita giving him a strange look. \"What?\" \"Your pants were falling down?\" He realized now she must not have known, though he could have sworn Balraj had practically announced it to the whole wedding audience. \"Um, yeah, when we danced briefly those few minutes it started to fall. I was so scared…I mean, I wanted to make an impression on India but not that kind.\" Lalita sat there, staring up at him, he wondered if he said something offensive again. But suddenly she started to laugh. Hard. Listening to her, he did realize it was actually quite funny, he joined in. Finally, they stopped, and he reached out his hand. \"Okay, you have to stand up with me.\" Taking it, he tried to keep from jumping at the touch of her skin. She stood up and they were fairly close. \"You steady?\" he asked. She nodded. Taking a gulp, he walked them towards the rink. Lalita tried to ignore the sensations she felt at his touch. She had to concentrate on the matter at hand, namely not to fall down on the hard, cold ice. As they started out, Darcy let her hold the edge of the rink while he was on the outside of her. In spite of his complaints earlier, he was having no problem standing up on his own accord. \"You seem to be a fine ice skater,\" she said, as she slowly let her hand go from the wall. \"This?\" He shook his head. \"This isn't skating. This is standing. I guess I can do that, but barely. By letting go of the side and standing up on your own, you're already way ahead of me.\" Somehow she wasn't so certain. \"I doubt that. But so far so good I guess.\" He laughed. \"Actually I do think I can make a point to you now.\" \"What?\" she said, still looking down. \"The way you are feeling on the ice, right now, this sense of unsteadiness…\" He waited for her to respond. \"Yeah, what about it?\" she asked. \"It's how I feel when I'm dancing.\" She looked up at him then, and he was grinning from ear to ear. Lalita's heart bounced and she grinned too. Then suddenly, she dropped. Instinctively she grabbed for him, which brought him down too. \"You okay?\" he asked. She laughed, it was going to take some getting used to, but this was going to be fun. \"Yes, as long as I can keep taking you down with me, I'll be fine.\" \"Well, won't we be the conspicuous couple? Here, let me help you up.\" Together they slowly glided over the ice, both fairly unsteady. Darcy told her about a saying of \"the blind leading the blind\" and she could see his point. He really wasn't better, his earlier confidence gone since he was moving. Lalita's eyes roamed over his body, his jeans and form fitting shirt he was wearing. Lalita could see those muscles underneath, and found they were much more distracting then all the skaters flying by at the speed of light. As the night went on, they got better. They'd spent little time talking, when one did try to speak, the other would fall and together they went down. Eventually she improved so much she skated away, and he pretended to act hurt when she was able to actually go far ahead of him. \"Sure, teach you how to skate, and then you leave me behind.\" He was smiling though. She watched as he started to catch up and so she would skate away. Now the night really became fun, as the cat and mouse game began. Of course, it was like watching a cat and mouse game of toddlers walking for the first time, but that didn't make it less fun. Eventually he did catch up to her, but was unable to stop. His force pushed them into the wall, not hard. And she would have fallen but he was able to hold the side with one hand and her with the other. Her chest was pushed into his and their breathing was rapid. \"Told you I would catch you,\" he said triumphantly. \"By ramming into me.\" His face was just inches from hers. Her heart was beating so hard she wondered if he could hear it. Surely he could feel it. She took the opportunity to feel his biceps through the cotton fabric. He was so warm. And close. She could smell him, she never wanted to kiss anyone so much in her life at that moment and the desire was on his face, he leaned in and for just a second, Lalita was going to let him. But she came to her senses, knowing she couldn't. Not here, not like this. She pulled away, quickly saying, \"I can't.\" Darcy's face flushed and she could see the pained look in his eyes. \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't…that was wrong. I shouldn't have over stepped…\" Lalita's heart ached watching the misunderstanding play out in front of her. She tried to explain, \"No, Will, it's not that, it's…\" A voice interrupted her. \"Hey, you two, need to keep moving. No standing still on the ice. That's what the common area is for.\" The man was someone who worked at the ice rink. Darcy nodded, looking quite stiff and formal. \"Of course, you're about to close soon, right?\" He barely waited for the man to respond when he turned to her, gesturing towards the entrance, \"It's probably time to leave.\" He skated away, she couldn't believe what happened, or didn't happen. She followed, he had already started handing her her shoes. Not sure what to say, she sat down and started changing. Darcy finished way before her, and grabbed her skates as soon as she let them go. \"I'll go ahead and turn these in.\" Lalita felt tears in her eyes. She knew Americans had no trouble expressing physical affection in public but for Indians, her religion, it was forbidden. She had lived with the tradition all her life, and accepted it. But the desire to break it was never so great as it was just a few minutes earlier. Darcy returned, she was still sitting. She started to get up, but he stopped her. Kneeling down, he looked her in the eyes. \"I'm truly sorry. That was thoughtless and arrogant of me. To think you felt that way about me. I shouldn't have…I know you probably want to go straight home now and never see me again, though tomorrow is the wedding so you'll be stuck me there but if you don't want to talk to me, I understand. I'll stay away if you want…\" Moved by the tears she saw in his eyes, Lalita reached out her hand, placing it over his mouth. \"You really don't know when to shut up, do you, William?\" They gazed in each other's eyes for a few minutes, and she moved her hand to caress his face. Touching him felt so right. \"You need to let me explain, please.\" He silently nodded. \"I can't…I'm not allowed…my religion prevents me from public displays of affection.\" His eyes widened, and she went on, \"Which I came very close to breaking just a few minutes earlier.\" \"Oh, Lalita,\" Darcy said, and then took her hand. Staring at it, he looked like he was internally arguing with himself on what to say next. Finally, he said, \"I keep screwing up.\" \"It's ok, it's my religion that you've had no exposure to. I shouldn't expect you to know it all, but, I probably should talk about it.\" He nodded. Together they got up, and walked out, he was still holding her hand. Their talk took place at a nearby coffee shop. Lalita talked for a long time, answering any questions. Darcy's questions were sincere. Lalita realized with shame if he had asked the same questions back in India, she would have doubted his sincerity and presumed he was making fun of her. Now she saw a man who really wanted to know. In return, he talked about his own religion and traditions, not as many but the few he had were just as important to him as to her. When they were done, there was a new understanding between them. It was soon time to go home. They parked the car and Darcy helped her out. They walked to the front door. People were inside but no one had heard them yet. She turned to face him. \"I had a lovely time tonight.\" He smiled, \"Good, remember that because you will have bruises from those falls from earlier.\" \"Falling is good,\" Lalita said absent mindedly, realizing how close he was. Technically they were still in public but no one was on the street and her family was inside. She reached out, touching his chest, feeling the contours of his muscles. Hesitantly he approached. She made no effort to move away so Darcy slowly moved forward, gently kissing her forehead. She circled her arms around his waste. He took a step back, but forgot the porch step was behind him. He managed to keep from falling, but now he was one step below her which put them at eye level. Lalita giggled, he really was endearing. How could she not notice when he was in India? Soon her smile faded and she leaned in, following her instinct, gone were all inhibitions. The touch of his lips on hers was fleeting but enough for her to move forward. He deepened the kiss and Lalita forgot everything around her, just enjoyed the sensations rolling through her body. Her experience of kissing was limited. When Jaya had told her what it was like to kiss Balraj, Lalita had no idea what her sister was talking about. Now with Darcy she knew exactly what her sister had experienced. Eventually he pulled away. Lalita found herself slightly off balance and held onto the column to her right. She had to take a few seconds to recover. Meanwhile, his walk to the car was backwards so he could keep eye contact, making her laugh. \"I'll see you tomorrow at the wedding,\" he said, hopeful. \"Oh yes, I'll be looking forward to it.\" She really would.[Chapter 6] Note: This skips now to practically the last scene. I always hated we never actually heard Lalita say she loved Darcy, to him or anyone. I needed real closure, like Darcy and Lizzie had right after Jane and Bingley's proposal. This is the best I can do. Chapter Five (Last) Darcy couldn't stop touching his lip, it was throbbing by now, though the pain seemed trivial at this point. His best friend was marrying the woman whom he loved, and she returned that love. Darcy should be ecstatic. But instead, he couldn't stop thinking of what Mrs. Bakshi said a few minutes ago, trying to get Balraj to fix Lalita up with his own family. Just a few days ago he had laughed off her attempt to marry Jaya to Brad, but now when Lalita was her focus it didn't seem funny at all, especially since it didn't occur to anyone he might be a hopeful candidate. Did he really ruin his chances back in LA? Lalita had been staring at him since her mother's comment and it looked like she was horrified, but was it because she now realized her mother would be devoting most of her attention to getting her married or was there more to it? Darcy sat in silence, trying to pleasantly listen to the plans being made and everyone's chatter, but he felt lost. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore, he needed to leave. Standing up, everyone stopped and looked at him. \"I'm sorry to interrupt, I just think I better be…\" \"Letting me clean up your face. I'll just take Will to the bathroom.\" Lalita then moved across the room, taking his hand and leading him away. He wanted to believe this was a good sign, but maybe she wanted to let him down gently in private. The bathroom was down the hallway, and they were definitely out of earshot. She opened the mirror where her hosts kept the medicines. Trying to stall for time, he asked, \"You know where they keep the first aid?\" \"Yes, well,\" Lalita said, \"Lakhi had cut herself when we were here before and I remembered they came in here to get a Band-Aid.\" She pulled out disinfectant, wipes and ointment, and then concentrated on unwrapping everything. Darcy leaned on the wall, realizing how tired he was. He had come straight from LA to Balrag's home then to Lalita to only run around looking for Wickham. He was exhausted. He made a decision, \"Lalita, you really don't have to, I can go if you want…\" \"Why would I want that?\" She asked, looking quite serious, her eyes brimming with tears. Maybe she was nervous about hurting a man who helped save her sister. \"Because you made it clear how you felt about me. Back in LA. I've been a pri-err, jerk and I nearly ruined your sister's happiness as well as my friend's. Why would you want me around?\" \"Will, you resolved it. They are engaged now. And after Lakhi-\" \"Yeah, after Lakhi. Again, that's my fault. If I had just told you about Wickham from day one, that could have been avoided. Lalita, I'm sorry. If he had gotten away with running off with her, I'd never have forgiven myself.\" Lalita was crying now. She reached out and took his hand. \"Will, that's not your fault. The truth is, if you had told me, I probably wouldn't have believed it. I was a fool, my earlier impression of you had me convinced…oh, those signs of Wickham were there all along, I just chose to ignore them.\" He stared at her hand holding his. Did she feel the same? \"I was an ass in India, to you, to everyone. It's because of my callous behavior that led you to believe Wickham in the first place.\" She lifted his chin so they were eye to eye. \"We can keep doing this, blaming each other over something we can't change, the past, but I'd rather think about other things, like the future.\" \"You…do you want a future with me? Some of it will require living in LA, at least part of the time…\" \"I'd travel to the ends of the world with you,\" she said smiling. \"I never understood that before…understanding women who would drop everything to live with someone in a foreign land. But I can't imagine living without you. On the plane flight here, I was in turmoil because I knew life would be miserable without you.\" He smiled a little bit, \"That's funny. It's why I came here to explain. I was in agony after you left and I didn't get a chance to explain. Or not so much explain but rectify what I had done.\" \"There was this part of me that was hoping you would come.\" His stare led her to go on, \"Naturally I wouldn't have admitted it though.\" He grinned. \"Naturally.\" She looked at his lip then and said, \"We really need to clean this up.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" he said, removing his jacket. \"Go ahead; I'll be brave and strong.\" She brushed one swab across his lip and he immediately yelped. \"That's your idea of brave and strong?\" \"Hey, I've been up since yesterday, or the day before or something. You should give me a break.\" She paused at his comment, then continued but as gently as possible. \"I should tell you, I didn't have feelings for Wickham. Not like that.\" He flinched but not at the pain this time. He had wondered about their relationship, they seemed so close in India. He nearly went mad with jealousy. But he hadn't wanted to ask, been afraid of her answer. She went on, \"I admit he was attractive and charming, but what made him different than everyone else is he knew you, and in spite of my insistence that I wanted nothing to do with you, I couldn't get enough hearing stories about you, even if they were negative.\" \"Again, I'm sorry I acted like such a…\" \"No, Will,\" she said. \"What I mean is, our whole relationship was spent talking most of the time about you. It never occurred to me that was all we had until he left. I missed him some in the beginning, but it faded very quickly. Then coming to LA, you brought up Johnny's name, forcing me to admit I didn't miss him.\" \"Flying back to LA with you, sort of pinning you to your seat like that, I always took it as a good sign you didn't force your sisters to sit between us.\" She laughed. \"I wasn't sure what to do, so startled at your gesture. But the ride was fairly enjoyable.\" She was blushing now. He grinned. He had watched her sleep and covered her up with his jacket. He fell asleep himself. When he was awake she was up and his jacket back in his lap. \"I didn't snore did I?\" \"No,\" she returned. \"I woke up before you and watched you sleep. I kept your jacket on until I knew you were waking.\" \"Really?\" She was done now and putting everything away. \"Honestly, Will, you have no idea what effect you were having on me?\" \"Not then. Or later. I just wanted you to get to know the real me, hoping maybe then you wouldn't hate me so much.\" She closed the medicine door. She walked over to him the other side of the doorway. \"I don't know if I ever really hated you. You drove me crazy, as you say, but if I really hated you, you wouldn't have bothered me so much.\" He laughed. \"Well, wish I had that advice then.\" She laughed too. \"Of course, I didn't love you then either, not until I got to know you in…\" He cut her off, \"Wait. What did you just say?\" She stopped and stared at him. \"Hmmm?\" \"Did you say you loved me?\" Shyly she nodded. Without thinking, he grabbed her and kissed her, ignoring the pain on his lips. Though startled at first, she reciprocated. After a few breathless moments they parted. Looking around to make sure no one saw, he looked back at her, \"Sorry. I know I'm not supposed to just grab you and kiss you like that but I think for now you're going to have to restrict saying those words until we are completely alone otherwise I might lose it again.\" Her face was practically glowing. She leaned in close but just out of reach and whispered, \"You're going to have to get used to it, Mr. Darcy. I love you and you're going to have to learn to live with it.\" His heart was on fire. \"With pleasure, Ms Bakshi.\" And he leaned forward for another kiss. When they parted, they walked hand in hand back to the living room. Things still needed to be settled and neither wanted to take away from Jaya and Balraj's moment. They could talk to her parents later. ","Summary":" I recently watched Bride and Prejudice for the first time.

Please read and review! --------------- One --------------- Lalita Bakshi loved living on a farm. She loved everything about it: she would often go out in the fields and just breathe in the fresh air of her little home town, Amritsar. Though her mother wanted the family to move to a big city in the US or UK, her father, a kind, normally easy-going man flatly refused to move. He and his four daughters all dearly loved their old house in a quaint town in India. As long as she could remember, Lalita had lived in their house, and she didn't want to move. Lalita had just finished university, and had graduated with Masters in English, Art and Maths. Her older sister, Jaya, was one year older than her and had finished university as well. Her younger sisters, Maya and Lakshmi (everyone called her Lakhi) were twins, a year younger than her, still studying in uni. They did not look identical at all and were complete opposites in personality as well. The trailer she was sitting on was connected to a tractor and she often visited the fields and helped out. She watched as workers began cutting away bits of the sea of green before her. Lalita sighed happily. I love living here, she thought. ----- India's… different, thought William Darcy, as he stepped out of the aeroplane, trying to maintain a positive outlook. He was in India with his best friend, Balraj and Balraj's sister, Kiran. Both were Indian, but had been brought up in England. Will himself had lived all his life in America with his mother and father alternately. As a result, he and his sister never really had a family home. Anyway, the landscape before him was… crowded. His first impression was of people, lots of people, then his second impression was the sounds. There were many sounds: cows mooing, bells ringing, people walking and talking, the cries of salesmen calling out their wares, beggars asking for coins, hands held out. His third impression was of how hot it was: he was wearing a suit with a coat on top of his blazer and in this weather, it was stifling. As he got in the black Jeep that would be their main mode of transport now, he removed his coat, but was not afforded much relief from the relentless heat. He looked out of his window at the exotic scenery around him. It was rare to see a separate house; there were mostly apartments and units to save space and the shops around were crowded together. The shop signs themselves ranged from new to shabby and peeling, but all were crowded like the streets, shop names and wares both in English and some strange symbols. Will guessed that it was in Hindi, the nation's official language. \"Looks a bit like New York,\" he commented to Kiran, referring to the way everything was bunched together. Kiran, who was sitting next to him in the car gave a short laugh. \"Get used to it, Darcy,\" she said, surveying the view. \"We'll be staying here for two weeks.\" For a time, Will listened as Kiran and Balraj told him what to expect at the wedding they would be attending the next day. Balraj was the groom's best man, and he had invited Will along to wedding in an attempt to get him away from work for a while. Will had only agreed because his mother had wanted him to expand their business in hotels by buying some in India. That was the reason he told Balraj, anyway. Actually, he wanted to get away from his mother for a bit. Lately, she had been trying to get him to go out with this rich girl from New York, Anne. He was sick and tired of her attempts at playing matchmaker. Anne was a nice enough girl and quite pretty and all, but she was shallow and didn't have enough brains to fill an eggcup. Will wasn't sure exactly what he wanted, but he was sure of one thing: he didn't want his marriage to turn out like his parents', the ultimate business venture that went wrong. He wanted to marry someone he couldn't wait to see everyday. He was jolted out of his reverie as the driver slammed the brakes on the Jeep. He leant out of the window to see what the problem was. He heard a few loud moos and saw two or three cows standing in the road. Nobody made any move to drive them out of it, and driver merely honked his horn and waited for them to disperse. He laughed, surprised. \"Jesus, Balraj, where the hell've you brought me?\" Balraj explained that in India, cows were considered sacred because of the Law of Manu, which was made in the fourth century AD. The Law stated that cows were holy animals because the Hindu god, Shiva's mount was a cow. Anybody who killed a cow would be hanged and anyone who harmed a cow would have to pay a fine. Even today, cows were considered sacred and nobody was allowed to be cruel to one, so that was why they wandered the streets freely. Will nodded but didn't say anything. He accepted other beliefs but to him, cows were just dumb animals good for nothing but giving milk and meat. He was careful not to say any of this aloud, though. He didn't want to alienate his best friend on his first day in India. They pulled into the driveway of the hotel they were staying in, the D.N. International. As Will walked up the stairs with Kiran and Balraj (the lift was out of order), he wondered what surprises India would bring. ----- A/N: Well? Was that okay for a first chapter? Love it? Hate it? Let me know! Review![Chapter 2] --------------- Two --------------- Lalita was putting on her earrings, getting ready for the wedding reception she was going to. It was her friend Namrata's wedding to a rich Indian guy from London. The groom had apparently looked at a lot of girls, but Namrata was the one he liked best. Namrata had confided in her and Chandra that she liked the groom and his family and was curious to see what London was like. Lalita's mother smiled at the eldest daughter, Jaya. \"I heard the famous Balraj from UK is looking for a girl as well,\" she said happily. \"He's our only hope,\" she added more seriously. \"If we do not get the eldest married first, we'll never be able to marry the rest of you for the shame!\" Jaya rolled her eyes. Lately, their mother had been worrying and bothering them to look at every Indian guy there was to see if he was an ideal groom. She wanted all her daughters to be married to rich men, so that they could support her when she got older. Lalita understood that, but why couldn't they earn money and look after her? Why did they have to be dependant on some rich guy? Lalita rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath, \"Why does she think that every rich guy who comes to India must be shopping for a wife?\" Jaya, who heard her, giggled. \"I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I hope he is,\" she said, referring to Balraj. Lalita threw an amused look at her sister. \"What, shopping, or loaded?\" Jaya laughed. \"Both,\" she replied. Lalita's mother bustled around, helping the various girls with their outfits, but stopped dead when she saw what the youngest (by two minutes), Lakhi was wearing. \"Lakhi, do you think your mother has gone crazy, that I'm going to let you wear that?\" For once, Lalita thought that her mother had a point. Lakhi was wearing an extremely revealing red outfit: the skirt was fine, it was like a normal dress, but the top covered barely more than a bra would. Lakhi adjusted and shifted it, looking in the mirror. \"But it's killing, Mama,\" she protested, fingering the red material, \"it's what everyone's wearing in Mumbai!\" Their mother was adamant. \"I want Balraj to look intoJeyes,\" she snapped, \"not your cleavage!\" Maya said smugly, siding with their mother, \"I told you, Lakhi, it's very vulgar!\" Lalita sighed inwardly at the squabbles and put on the last touches of make-up for the reception. ----- Will Darcy had not had a good day. It was now his second day in India, and they were on the way to the wedding reception of Balraj's friend. The previous day, the wireless internet receptors in the hotel had not worked properly, so he couldn't send his sister, Georgie, an email to say that he had arrived safely. Then when they had been eating dinner, the power had gone. The waiters apologized frequently and lit candles at every table. This was not so bad, but it happened again when Will was typing an email (the wireless had been fixed) and he hadn't saved it, so he had had to type it all again. Then the hotel's computer system crashed and hotel employees went around the rooms, collecting everyone's details again. It had been tedious, to say the least. Right now, he was wearing an Indian outfit called a 'kurta': it was a white shirt with embroidered edges that went down about to his knees and white pants with a drawstring at the top. The shirt was okay except for a bit of gold wire from the embroidery that was making the back of his neck itch. The pants, however, were a whole different story. The drawstring kept coming undone and he had done it up about five times. And they weren't even there yet. ----- Lalita looked down from the balcony as the noise level rose up a notch. She followed peoples' eyes to the doorway, where a man of medium height and long curly black hair was accompanied by a girl with shorter curly black hair who looked like she might be his sister. Behind them, looking a little lost amongst all the spice and colour that was an Indian wedding, was a man with brown hair and blue-green eyes, wearing a white kurta. His hair was too light and his skin too fair for him to be Indian, so Lalita guessed that he was William Darcy, Balraj's friend from Oxford. All of them were about Jaya's age. Then she saw – to her mortification – her mother and Chandra's mother, Mrs Lamba, staring openly at Balraj and his friend and they definitely noticed. She looked away from the newcomers, feeling herself blush. Why did her mother have to be like that? ----- Will nudged Balraj. \"Good Lord,\" he muttered, \"is it just me or is every woman over fifty in this place giving you the eye?\" Kiran snorted. \"Don't be ridiculous, Darcy,\" she said, \"every mother in this room is wetting her knickers over him for their daughters.\" Will looked around, unnerved, as everybody stared at them, then whispered something to their neighbours. He earned many strange looks as well, and he wondered whether they always reacted this way to a western guest at an Indian wedding. It was only then that he realized that his drawstring pants were hanging down at his knees. He hurriedly went behind a table and pulled them up, tying the drawstring as tightly as he could. When he rejoined the group: \"Can we leave yet?\" asked Kiran, sounding bored. Will looked up gratefully. He too had been wanting to leave, but didn't want to sound rude by asking. \"Yeah,\" he agreed, \"It's about ten a.m. in New York and I wouldn't mind getting back a bit early so I can go through the hotel finances–\" \"Will you stop working for once?\" Balraj asked, sounding annoyed. \"And you,\" he said, turning to Kiran, \"stop being such a cobra. This is our dear, dear motherland.\" A waiter came up to them, offering them a platter of some deep-fried snack. Kiran refused, saying that she was on a diet, but Balraj took one. Will also took one after hesitating slightly. \"Are you sure this is safe to eat?\" he asked. \"I don't want to be getting Delhi belly on my first full day.\" Balraj scoffed and assured him that it would be fine. A bit later, he noticed Balraj looking up, and followed his gaze: he was looking at a pretty Indian girl in a pink dress who was leaning over the balcony. She happened to look down and noticed that Balraj was looking at her; she smiled shyly at him, then looked away. Will's glance roved around the balcony; there were many girls there, no doubt helping the bride get ready. Then his gaze landed on another pretty Indian girl who had joined the girl who Balraj was looking at. The two girls were smiling and talking together; then the girl made some wild gestures with her hands before bursting into laughter. Will felt his own lips twitch upwards in a smile, even though he didn't know what was so funny. Just then, the girl looked straight down at him, and he looked away quickly, surveying the tables unseeingly, hoping that she hadn't noticed, though she probably had. He chanced a glance up again, and she had looked away, seemingly having dismissed it. He sighed in relief, then watched as surreptitiously as he could (which wasn't very, considering the angle his neck had to be at to be looking up there). He was not sure why he was watching this particular girl; sure, she was pretty, but so were a lot of them, really. There was something about her that captured his attention. Then the girl and the others moved away from the balcony, going into an open door. The girl he had been watching turned around as an afterthought and closed the door, as if she knew he was watching. -----[Chapter 3] A/N: I must've watched this movie at least ten times. Yes, I know I'm obsessed. But oh well. I just realized after writing a few chapters that Lalita has become a weird mix of me, her character in the movie and Mia Thermopolis from the Princess Diaries. --------------- Three --------------- Lalita helped the bride fasten her green sari in place. \"Are you sure about going to London? You've only met him twice,\" she reminded her gently, smiling at her friend. Namrata smiled and leaned back, apparently satisfied with her appearance. \"I'm sure, Lalita. His family is nice and so is he. And I would love to go to London.\" Lalita smiled through her sadness that her friend was leaving and hugged her. Just then, the strains of music that indicated the dance where the boys and girls in the wedding were to meet (they didn't talk to or go near the boys until this dance) came. Lalita loved singing and dancing and just having fun. Laughing excitedly, she waited for the cue for the girls to go down the stairs. ----- As the first strains of lively music arrived, Will looked to Balraj for an explanation, but he wasn't there. He turned to Kiran, who explained that the first song and dance was the one where the boys and girls would meet, and where the groom would see the bride for the first time that day. Will nodded, but couldn't help feeling uncomfortable as he noticed an oldish man in a turban with a grey beard listening in to their conversation. Will looked around as all the young men in the crowd organized themselves into a formation and started singing. Balraj was at the front, standing out because of his black 'kurta'; all the others were wearing white. He was doing an energetic dance, moving his arms and legs about wildly. Amazingly, everybody was in time, doing the moves almost perfectly. Will deduced that it was probably a common dance at Indian weddings, and that these men had had a lot of practice. Or they were just all really good dancers. Will listened to the song that they were singing, noticing that the foreign words were repeated quite a few times. He assumed that the language was Hindi, because Balraj knew Hindi. He looked to Kiran, and she translated, \"All these pretty girls, fluttering about like kites without strings.\" He nodded, then frowned in confusion. What girls? He had thought too soon: the girls just came down the staircase leading to the balcony. Then they joined the dance as well, and he noticed that the pretty girl he had been watching was in the front line with the girl in the pink dress. For a few minutes, Will watched them dancing and singing; the song sounded quite pleasant. But then, the boys started singing alone again, and the song took an ominous, angry note. They pointed fingers of accusation at the girls, then one man came to the front and faked convulsions that racked his whole body before mock-fainting. \"These girls are like naked live wires; get too close and they'll sting you with their electric shock of love,\" translated Kiran, talking into his ear (the song was so loud that they would otherwise have had to yell to be heard). Then she noticed the man with the grey beard looking at them calculatingly and backed away quickly. The song seemed to be drawing to a close. Balraj slung his arm around the groom's shoulders and started singing a song that was softer than the other one. A pretty girl dressed in light green came down the stairs surrounded by the other girls. Her jewellery was magnificent: gold earrings set with emeralds with a matching necklace, gold and green bangles on her wrists and tinkling anklets on her feet. Balraj repeated the line of the song he was singing. Will looked curiously at Kiran and she translated again, \"When the moon disappears, the light of your beauty takes its place.\" He nodded, watching. The song drew to a close and everybody started talking. Suddenly, a hush fell and the crowd parted; one of the women who had been looking at Balraj before started singing and dancing on the stairs. Her singing was quite good, but maybe she should have left the dancing to somebody a bit younger. Quite a few people were clapping in time and Will grinned in amusement as a man – presumably the lady's husband – tried to pull her out of the spotlight. Once she had finished singing, Balraj came over to them, his face flushed from excitement. Just as he came over, another song started, one of a different kind: this time, there were specific partners for each person, and Balraj had apparently asked the pretty girl in the pink dress to dance. Also, he had seemed to know which dance was coming, and he had come over to pull Will there onto the dance floor and make him dance. Though he resisted, Will was dragged along by Balraj and his hands were placed firmly in those of the girl he had been watching before. Will could feel heat creeping up his neck and looked back in vain for Balraj who was of course long gone. Then he turned back to the girl, who smiled at him and patiently positioned his hands in hers to that their arms were crossed and they were holding each other's right and left hands. Then the dance began, and it was mainly them holding each other's hands and spinning in circles, leaning back, relying on each other's weight to keep them from toppling over backwards. A brief smile flashed across Will's face as he recalled vaguely that this dance was like a trust exercise he had done in summer camp once. Then Will realized with a throb of horror that his drawstring pants were coming loose again. Releasing one hand, he pulled them up, trying to make it look like he was wiping his hands. The girl took this opportunity to brush a lock of dark hair out of her face with her free hand. This happened a few more times, and once the girl laughed out loud and Will flushed, thinking that she had realized what had happened to him and was making fun of him. But she smiled at him again, her eyes sparkling, and he decided that it was because she was enjoying the dance. As soon as the song finished and the music faded, Will abruptly dropped the girl's hands, nodded briefly to her and hurried off, though most of the couples spent a few minutes making conversation before parting. He noticed the quickly shielded look of hurt on the girl's face and felt bad about it, but he had a more pressing problem to fix. He went to a secluded corner and lifted up the front of his shirt so that he could see the drawstring he was fiddling with. Kiran and Balraj came over while he was doing it. \"Darcy,\" said Balraj, sounding highly amused, \"what are you doing?\" Will didn't bother looking up, still toying with The Drawstring From Hell. \"Drawstring keeps coming undone,\" he muttered. Balraj's voice was filled with laughter. \"Let's see,\" he said loudly. Will finally looked up and noticed a random guy with a turban and a grey beard (not the same one who had been listening to their conversations) looking in with great amusement. \"Why don't you go alert the media?\" Will said sarcastically, not at all amused (Balraj was laughing his head off). ----- Lalita listened half-heartedly to her sister Maya complain about Lakhi. Inwardly, she was brooding about William Darcy. Why had he been so abrupt? Was she looking ugly? She looked in the mirror opposite the hall. No. Lalita didn't think herself particularly pretty, but she knew she wasn't horribly ugly. What was it, then? Were all Americans this rude? Or was it just Darcy? \"…do you know she's been on her phone all night, texting boys?\" ranted Maya, oblivious that her sister's mind was elsewhere. \"She'll give us all a bad name! Lakhi? Lakhi!\" With that, Maya hurried off, presumably to tell Lakhi off and bring her back to their table. Sure enough, Maya came back, with their parents and Lakhi a few minutes later. Jaya also joined them, smiling excitedly. She had enjoyed the dance with Balraj, and apparently, they had had fun talking and dancing. Just then, Balraj, his sister and Darcy came over, Balraj smiling at Jaya. \"Hello,\" he said, giving them a friendly smile. \"We're from the groom's side; we'd like to introduce ourselves. I'm Balraj, and this–\" he gestured to his sister –\"is my sister, Kiran, and this is my good friend, William Darcy.\" Kiran smiled at them politely and Darcy gave them a brief smile. Suddenly, he dipped down slightly and came back up again, as though his knees had buckled. Lalita stared at him, wondering what had happened. It might have been her imagination, but she thought his face was more flushed than before. Her father smiled at them and shook Balraj's hand. \"I'm Aman Bakshi, this is my wife, Manoba Bakshi and our four daughters: Chaya, Lalita, Maya and Lakhi,\" he finished, gesturing to each one, and reciting their names in age order. \"Good Lord,\" exclaimed Balraj, \"four daughters in one family! God has blessed you four times over!\" Aman smiled in reply. Darcy was staring at her in a weird way, and it was beginning to creep her out. Was there something on her face? His face was even more flushed now; Lalita was definitely not imagining it. \"Would you do me the honour?\" Balraj asked Jaya, who smiled softly. Aman stood to let Jaya pass and Manoba was practically wetting her pants with glee at the fact that her daughter appeared to be snaring the rich Balraj. \"Darcy,\" said Balraj pointedly, \"why don't you ask one of Jaya's lovely sisters to dance?\" Darcy's eyes widened, and he looked at her. \"No,\" he said flatly, then hastily amended, \"I mean, I can't. I just got a conference call; I have to get back to work.\" Lalita gave him a small smile. \"It's not as difficult as it looks,\" she said, wondering if he was apprehensive about dancing because he didn't know how. \"I could show you.\" \"No – I really can't. Nice – nice to meet you all.\" With that, he was gone. As soon as he was out of earshot, her mother said, sounding annoyed, \"What does he think? That we are not good enough for him?\" Lalita chewed thoughtfully on a laddoo, an Indian sweet. It all came back to the ultimate question: were all Americans rude, or was it just Darcy? Though the answer was a lot more simple, however. If Lalita had looked at him when he was walking away, she would have seen him angrily pull up his pants. ----- A/N: Do you know what the funniest part is? The whole pants-falling-down scenario actually happened in the movie. I'm stupid, so I only picked it up in the fourth viewing.[Chapter 4] A/N: I wrote this at my cousin's house, so I did Darcy's and Lalita's argument entirely from memory and the breakfast table conversation as well, so don't kill me if some of it's wrong. And also, sorry that this chapter was so late in coming. I had written most of it up, then my computer froze and I had to type it all again. On top of that, it's been pretty busy here. So I hope this chapter is worth the wait. I wonder if anyone actually reads author's notes. If you don't, I might leave a boring surprise for you in them that you won't regret missing. I don't edit my AN's at all, you know. They probably wouldn't make sense at all if I actually read them. Oh, and this chapter's pretty long by my standards; I just couldn't work out where to end it, so it goes on. --------------- Four --------------- The next morning, the family all woke up bright and early, for today was the actual wedding. Right now, the family was eating breakfast, talking merrily about the wedding, until… \"Did you see Mrs Lamba's face?\" crowed their mother. \"Balraj didn't dance with any other girl all night! I knew he wouldn't be able to resist my pretty Jaya's charm.\" She smiled at the eldest daughter. \"Imagine what it would be like to have Jaya living in UK,\" she said blissfully. \"We could visit her there anytime we wanted!\" Their father frowned, finally looking up from his breakfast. \"I would hate to have my daughters living so far away.\" Their mother waved it aside. \"But we have so many!\" she argued. \"Surely one or two can go live abroad. They'll earn more. God knows, they'll need it, because we can't afford to give them all decent dowries.\" Lalita sighed wearily. She knew what was coming next. She had heard this tirade a thousand times. \"I knew we should have moved to US when we had the chance!\" said their mother. \"Did I ever tell you,\" said their father to the girls, \"about a man who moved to America and made a lot of money?\" \"My brother got all the papers to sponsor us, but no, you wouldn't move, old man!\" continued their mother. \"And he built this big American house, with three swimming pools in the garden,\" continued their father, ignoring their mother. \"And now he owns three Subway franchises in New Jersey, and what do we have?\" said their mother furiously. \"An old house, an old farm and new bills!\" Lalita saw Lakhi mouthing the words along with her mother and fought back a laugh. \"When his father visited him from India, he asked, 'Son, why are there three pools?'\" their father told. \"The son said, 'Well, one pool is filled with cold water for when I'm hot, and one with hot water for when I'm cold.' The father nodded, then asked, 'Yes, but why the third pool?' The son replied proudly, 'That's for when I don't feel like swimming at all!'\" Everybody laughed except for their mother who gave a sarcastic laugh and sat down in a huff. Then she smiled at Jaya. \"Did you see Balraj's sister's sari looked so expensive. I heard it was made by the same designer who made a dress for Princess Diana!\" Their mother gave a delighted laugh while Lalita rolled her eyes. \"That's who'll be making Jaya's wedding dress!\" Jaya smiled and hugged her happily. Their mother smiled. \"Balraj is a gift from the gods,\" she sighed; but then her face darkened. \"His Yankee friend could learn a lot from him. Did you see the way he slighted our Lalita?\" Lalita raised one eyebrow slightly and gave a barely perceptible sigh. ----- Will and Balraj were standing on the balcony of their hotel room, looking out at the view. The city was, if possible, even more busy than when Will first saw it. There were people hurrying to get to their various destinations on scooters, bicycles and auto-rickshaws. It was rare to see a car, for it was easier to go on the road on a smaller vehicle. \"There's something I don't get,\" said Will. \"If you really want to get married, why don't you hook up with some Indian girl from England or even America? At least you'd have something in common.\" Balraj turned to look at him. \"Look, I didn't have any problems talking with Jaya, did I? She's intelligent… she's beautiful…\" Balraj's face was shining and Will could tell that he really liked Jaya. \"Come on, Bal,\" he said resignedly. \"You said it yourself, man, we're in Hicksville, India.\" Balraj smiled slyly and said, \"Then why did I see you eyeing up Lalita?\" Will froze for a second, fighting down his blush – had he been that obvious? – and slowly turned around. \"She's beautiful, yeah… but…\" Balraj laughed. \"But not your mother's idea of an heiress?\" Will laughed suddenly. \"Not exactly, no,\" he admitted. ----- Lalita sat, cross-legged on the floor, watching with a smile as the priests poured offerings in the ceremonial fire, chanting verses. Everybody was sitting silently, watching them pour in ghee and rice. They were sitting with the bride's side on one side of the fire, and the groom's friends and family were sitting on the other side. Lalita happened to look at the groom's side and saw Will Darcy looking at her. When he realized she had seen him, he gave her a small smile. Her cheerful smile dropped. Still smarting from yesterday, she looked away coldly and pretended she hadn't seen him. She remained expressionless for the rest of the ceremony. ----- Lalita and Chandra were watching the festivities from the balcony, where they had a good view of everyone. Lalita had danced with several different guys, and now she was taking a brief break from the action. \"They look sizzling, no?\" said Chandra, gesturing towards Jaya and Balraj who were dancing together. \"She should seduce him… give him a taste, so he'll come begging back for more!\" Lalita laughed. \"And what makes you such an expert, hmm?\" Chandra smiled slyly. \"I know enough to know that if that damn cute Darcy was looking at me the way he's looking at you right now, I wouldn't ignore him.\" Lalita followed Chandra's eyes, and sure enough, Darcy was looking up at her. \"You're nuts,\" she said firmly to Chandra. Darcy didn't like her; he had made that clear enough already. And also, an adjective like cute should only be used on kittens, puppies and little children. Darcy was undeniably good-looking, but he just wasn't her type, and she wasn't his either, judging by the way he had treated her so far. She looked down at Darcy again, and saw him move to the door that led to the stairs up to the balcony. \"Oh God, is he coming up here?\" she muttered, almost to herself. \"Lalita?\" \"Mmm?\" \"Marry him.\" Lalita looked at her friend incredulously, then saw her mischievous smile. \"Divorce him right away,\" she continued, still smiling in that way. \"Then give me half!\" The two girls burst out laughing, and were still laughing when Darcy came up to them about a second later. \"It's not my tie, is it?\" he asked uncertainly, straightening it though it was already immaculate. Then he sneezed suddenly and muttered, \"Excuse me.\" Chandra said, \"Someone's thinking of you. I'm off to get a Coke!\" She left, smiling and waggling her eyebrows suggestively at Lalita. There was a slightly awkward pause as Lalita looked to where Chandra had been with a very obvious 'thanks a lot for leaving me here' look on her face. Then she went back to leaning over the balcony and Darcy joined her. \"What did she say?\" he asked, looking a bit baffled. \"It's just an old saying,\" explained Lalita. \"We say that if you sneeze, it means someone's thinking of you.\" He nodded, then said, \"It's probably my lawyer. Can't get any work done in the hotel I'm in.\" \"Which hotel's that?\" asked Lalita curiously. \"The D.N. International,\" he replied. \"That's the best hotel in town,\" she said, wondering what problems he could have encountered there. \"Oh,\" he said, then continued, \"but their computer system keeps crashing, the electricity goes… I guess I don't really know how business functions here.\" There was an awkward silence, then Lalita asked, making a brave stab at conversation, \"Are you a barrister like Balraj?\" He shook his head. \"Oh, no, my family's in the hotel business.\" \"I'm sure Amritsar's hotels can't compare,\" she said sarcastically. \"But I bet there's a slight price difference. What does it cost to stay in one of your hotels?\" Darcy frowned slightly, as if thinking. \"For a room for four… about… five hundred dollars a night.\" Lalita gave a half-gasp, half-laugh. \"That's more than what most people earn here in a year!\" Darcy shrugged. \"Pretty bad when you put it like that; but people who can afford it, they want the best –\" he turned and saw the look on her face and said, half-joking (though there was something slightly defensive in his tone as well) –\"What, there's nothing wrong with having standards, is there?\" Lalita sniffed. \"No,\" she said, \"as long as you don't enforce them on others.\" She looked away from Darcy to see the dancing couples below. \"This is your first Indian wedding, right?\" she asked, a little later, once she had managed to swallow most of her ire. Darcy seemed to snap back to earth and answered, \"Yeah.\" After a pause, he added tactfully, \"It's been an experience.\" She frowned slightly. \"You're – not enjoying it?\" \"No, no, I am; I just find the whole arranged marriage thing a little strange and I don't really know how two people can get married when they don't really know each other.\" He looked at her and said, letting out a deep breath, \"Seems a little backward, don't you think?\" Lalita snorted. \"That is such a cliché! It's different now. It's more like a global dating service. The groom looks happy. Did his parents force him into it?\" Darcy looked taken aback by her reply. \"No, actually, he asked his parents to find him a bride. He was busy running his company, so he just wanted it to be simple.\" Lalita looked at him, and now she knew her cheeks were red from not a little anger. \"I see, and so he came here,\" she snapped. \"Is that what you think too? That India's the place for simple women?\" She gave a disgusted sigh and walked away from Darcy, down the stairs. ----- \"Lalita, wait! That's not what I meant!\" Will hurried down the stairs, trying to keep pace with her. She had her arms crossed and was frowning. \"Americans think they have the answers to everything,\" she fumed, \"including marriage. Pretty arrogant, considering they have the highest divorce rate in the world!\" She was walking down the stairs quite fast while she was saying all this. Ouch. That stung. Pity it was true. By now they had reached the bottom of the stairs. \"The groom just wanted his wedding to be traditional!\" he said, trying to defend himself. Will was about to apologize when Balraj came up to him. \"Darcy, stop boring her to death and get down here with us!\" He walked back to the dance floor. \"Look, Lalita,\" said Will a bit awkwardly, hoping to patch things up with her. \"I'm a hopeless dancer, but this looks like you screw in a lightbulb with one hand and pet the dog with the other.\" He let out a deep breath. \"Will you teach me?\" Lalita leaned closer to him. \"You know what?\" she asked in barely more than a whisper. Will's eyes widened, but then she snapped, \"I think you should find someone simple and traditional to teach you to dance like the natives.\" With that, she stalked away. ----- A/N: Rejection music plays Nothing I say can make that more dramatic.[Chapter 5] A/N: This chapter is pretty short, only about a thousand words, but it took me ages to write. I must've rewritten it at least five times. Stupid author's block. But then I watched 'Bride and Prejudice' again and I got back my lost muses. They're called Gertrude and Hubert. They ran away. But now they're back. So yeah. Just read. And review. Yeah. --------------- Five --------------- Will had tried a few times to approach Lalita, to apologize, explain himself, something, but each time she saw him coming towards her, she would quickly go and lose herself in the crowd to avoid him. After this happened three times, Will gave up and just watched people dancing for the rest of the night. So he was really quite glad when it was time for them to go. Balraj walked outside with Jaya, Lalita's older sister. Will was standing next to a pillar with Kiran; they were both waiting to leave. Just then, Jaya's family joined them. \"Mr Bakshi,\" said Balraj, \"we're all going down to Goa tomorrow; Darcy's looking at a hotel there and we'd love for Jaya to join us.\" Mr Bakshi smiled politely, then said, frowning slightly, \"Mr Balraj, I'm not sure if it would be appropriate for Jaya to go alone.\" \"Of course. I understand,\" said Balraj. \"Don't be silly, dear,\" said Mrs Bakshi, smiling at her husband in a strained way. She turned to Balraj. \"So kind of you to invite Jaya!\" Her voice was dripping with honey. \"Perhaps one of her sisters can accompany her,\" suggested Mr Bakshi. \"Papa, I can go to Goa,\" said the girl Will recognized as the youngest. She was called… Lakhi, he was sure. \"Lakhi, you're too young,\" said their father kindly. \"Perhaps Lalita can go.\" Lalita started at the mention of her name and flicked a quick glance at Will before turning back to her father. \"But, Papa –\" she began, but was cut off by her mother. \"Don't be silly, Lalita,\" she said, shooting daggers at her before smiling again. \"Go have fun with your sister.\" Will noted the mother's eagerness to send her eldest daughter off to Goa and frowned slightly. Lalita turned to look at Jaya, who had a hopeful look on her face. She sighed in resignation, then smiled. \"Sure,\" she said, hugging her sister. \"I'd love to come with Jaya.\" \"Excellent,\" said Balraj, \"we'll pick them up tomorrow morning.\" Lalita gave Will an inscrutable look before he walked away. Will was almost positive he heard Mrs Bakshi say, \"Have you gone crazy, old man? This is Jaya's chance to win him over once and for all. And he'll get to see her in a swimsuit!\" His frown deepened. He didn't want Balraj to be stuck with a gold-digging wife who just wanted him for his money. For now, he decided he would watch and wait, and when he was sure that Jaya only wanted the cash, then he would step in. And as for Lalita coming on their holiday… he felt weird about that. He couldn't figure out if he wanted her to come or was apprehensive about it. ----- The next morning, the car was a bit squashed, because there were five of them and the driver in a five seater car. The driver and Kiran sat in the front, and the other four were squashed in the back. Lalita sighed. Someone up there hated her. She was squashed into – guess who? – one William Darcy. They hadn't really spoken after their little tiff yesterday. Of course, Darcy seemed to be making an obvious effort to be polite to her. He had opened the car door for her, but had quailed at the glare she gave him. She was independent, dammit! She could open doors herself, believe it or not. But then a short while after that, she felt a little bit guilty for being so short with him: after all, he had only been trying to help. He wore an expression of hurt bewilderment whenever he looked at her. She had given him a small smile by way of apology and he seemed to perk up a bit after that. Anyway, the thing about squashing four people into seats meant for three… well, it's squashed. Balraj was seated by the left window, then Jaya, then Lalita, then Darcy. Being squashed into Jaya was not so bad, but being squashed into Darcy was… awkward. Balraj and Jaya seemed quite comfortable, but then, they got along really well. It was really squashed. Maybe you can't quite get an idea of exactly how squashed they were without a bit more description. Thighs jammed together, arms everywhere, shoulders clashing. After about ten minutes of this, they decided that they couldn't last the entire drive to Goa in this way. Balraj suggested (while smiling slyly at Darcy for some reason) that the girls sit on the guys' laps. Darcy seemed flustered and his face was flushed; Lalita herself was not too keen about the prospect of sitting on his lap, because she knew Balraj and Jaya would automatically pair up. She could feel her face heating up. She hurriedly pointed out that if Jaya sat on Balraj's lap, then there would be enough room for the other three to sit comfortably. A mixture of intense relief and something that might have been disappointment showed on Darcy's face, but Lalita was sure she'd imagined the disappointment. ----- Again, Will was confused. There were a lot of conflicting emotions. When Balraj had suggested that Lalita sit on his lap, he had felt mostly embarrassment and awkwardness. But a small part of him had felt like he actually wanted Lalita to sit on his lap. After four hours of contemplation (until they reached Goa), he had dismissed it, and reasoned that Lalita was a beautiful girl what with her almond-shaped eyes, smooth complexion, full lips, long dark hair and slim figure (he could have gone on, but he stopped himself). Of course he would want a beautiful girl to sit on his lap. He was male, after all. ----- Lalita looked around. She had been to Goa once before, but she had been about three years old then, and didn't remember much about it. Goa was a Portuguese settlement, so there were more westerners holidaying there than you would find in most other parts of India. There were sparkling blue pools, smooth beaches, palm trees and the ocean. It was beautiful, but in a completely different way to Amritsar. When they first went into the hotel, women in saris came up to them and garlanded them, blessing them and putting marks on their foreheads. Lalita suspected that they were only getting VIP treatment because Darcy was thinking of buying the hotel. She sighed and wondered when this trip would be over. ----- A/N: The next bit will be hard to write, so expect an update in… about three or four days? Yeah… if I can get it done by then.[Chapter 6] A/N: Sooooo sorry for the long wait, people. The worst thing is, I really don't have any excuse except… I had a bad case of author's block. Anyway, people who have watched the movie, a question for you: You know when Darcy goes, \"I'm not British, I'm American.\"? What does Lalita say before it? \"I don't you turning India into a theme park. I thought we got rid of ... like you!\" I've listened to it a million times, but I could never get what she said. If anyone knows, can you please review and tell me? Thanks. Now read. You know you want to… well, actually you probably don't. But read anyway. And review. Yes, review. Reviews make me feel warm and happy inside. A/N2: Thanks a lot to the Mouse in the Opera House for telling me the answer to the question above. (Answer: 'imperialists'). --------------- Six --------------- After a delicious lunch, they all lazed about around the pool, swimming after an hour had passed since the meal. Lalita didn't really have anyone to talk to, since Jaya and Balraj spent all their time together. She, Kiran and Darcy all kept mostly to themselves, or grouped together, the three extra wheels. When she was five, Lalita had loved going for long walks around their farm, so she had set out everyday to explore. She was friendly with all of the workers, and knew them all personally. One day, she had stumbled upon a pool of clear water into which the river flowed in and out. She often swum there still and had taught herself to swim. Needless to say, she won every race that the five – or sometimes, three – of them held that day. After a while, she got bored of swimming around. A luke-warm, chlorine-filled, torpid swimming pool just wasn't as exciting as a rushing, moving cool mass of water with trees and plants surrounding it and little fish swimming around. Also, Darcy and Kiran had already gotten out of the water, tired of her winning every race they held. She climbed out of the pool and dried herself off a bit with her towel, so she wouldn't drip on the book she wanted to read. She pulled out her copy of Pride and Prejudice and had started rereading when Kiran said lazily, \"Darcy darling, could you tear yourself away from the love of your life long enough to put some sunscreen on my back? I don't want my skin to get too dark.\" Darcy set aside his laptop and squeezed some sunscreen on his hands. \"I'm writing to my little sister, Georgie,\" he defended. Kiran turned so that her back was facing Darcy and she spotted Lalita reading. \"Oh my God!\" she exclaimed incredulously. \"You lugged that all the way here? Well, that explains why you don't have much room for outfits.\" Lalita barely looked up from her book, turning over the page. \"Do you have something against books? And you just resent them because they leave less room in your bag for your make-up?\" She looked up to see how Kiran would react. She looked taken aback and said rather defensively, \"No; I just never have time for them. Indians here have a lot more free time, you know.\" Lalita, who had been about to go back to reading, looked up sharply. \"Or maybe you're just a much more accomplished woman than I am,\" finished Kiran huffily. \"Maybe,\" she replied mysteriously, going back to her book. She heard Darcy laugh; he had been watching their minor disagreement with amusement. Suddenly, she stifled a laugh. She had just realized that there was a rich snob called William Darcy in Pride and Prejudice . And the heroine, Elizabeth, hated him. Well, she did at the start. At the end, she fell in love with him. Damn. The beginning at least seemed like the story of her life. \"Darcy's a great reader,\" said Kiran loudly, making Lalita look up slightly. \"In fact, I think a love of books is on his list for his ideal woman.\" She said the last very deliberately. Lalita slipped her bookmark in her book. It seemed like Kiran would take torturing Darcy over insulting Lalita; this looked to be interesting. \"I think you've had one too many seabreezes,\" Darcy retorted. Kiran continued, oblivious to his warning glare. \"No, I clearly recall a very drunken night in Oxford where you recited this list. I repeat, she had to be smart, speak several languages,\" Kiran gestured to Lalita, \"be graceful, witty, oh and voluptuous, of course, athletic –\" Here, another meaningful look was sent to Lalita. \"Kiran, would you drop it?\" asked Darcy, sounding weary and annoyed. It might have been the fact that he was sunburnt pretty much all over or more likely that he was uncomfortable with the topic. Or it could have been a mixture of both. Lalita said loftily, addressing Kiran, \"I'm not surprised Mr Darcy hasn't found his ideal woman with a list like that,\" she paused, directing the last at him, \"or maybe his standards are too high.\" Darcy pulled his laptop back on his lap. \"Touché,\" he said, sounding partially amused. \"Does this mean you're an ideal man?\" Lalita asked sarcastically. Darcy looked at her. \"Well, I guess you'd be a better judge of that than me,\" he replied, completely missing the sarcasm. Lalita rolled her eyes. \"Well, I haven't as yet met one,\" she said, as if that should be obvious. \"As far as I can tell, most men have faults: arrogance, pride, vanity…\" She looked pointedly at Darcy. Kiran, who had been watching this exchange with high amusement, laughed, \"She's certainly read you like a book, Darcy!\" \"No,\" said Darcy, shutting the lid of his laptop and putting it aside, turning to face her fully. \"I think you've got me all wrong.\" Lalita ignored him and continued, \"Well, you'd certainly have trouble finding your ideal woman in India. Women here are of the simple , traditional, subservient type.\" Darcy leaned back in his chair and wearily raked his fingers through his hair. \"Oh, come on,\" he muttered. \"Gimme a break. Now you're twisting my words.\" Lalita continued in that same lofty tone, \"You said it yourself, Mr Darcy. I'm sure you think India's beneath you.\" \"If I really thought that, then why would I be thinking of buying this place?\" he pointed out, sitting up straight and observing her. Turning completely serious, Lalita spluttered incredulously, gesturing around her at the swimming pool, the palm trees and the sparkly hotel, \"You think this is India?\" Darcy frowned slightly as if in puzzlement. \"Well, don't you want to see more investment, more jobs?\" \"Yes,\" she asserted impatiently, \"but who does it really benefit?\" At this point, Jaya and Balraj swam over to them, looking slightly concerned and quite puzzled. \"Isn't this what all tourists want when they come to India? Five-star accommodation with a bit of culture thrown in? You want people to go to India without having to deal with Indians!\" Darcy considered thoughtfully what she had said. \"That's good,\" he said, referring to her last sentence. \"Remind me to put that on the tourism brochure.\" The fact that he said it completely seriously, without a trace of jocularity just made Lalita's blood boil more. As he noticed her glaring at him, he said defensively, \"What? Your government wants the tourism; I'm not the bad guy here!\" Her eyes narrowed to slits, Lalita hissed, \"I don't want you turning India into a theme park.
