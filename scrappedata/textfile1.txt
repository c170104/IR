[{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"A Story Worth Sharing","Author":"Zanessatroyella2017","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13235825","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['24 years old Dylan Bolton walked into his old high school, East High, with a smile on his face. It had been six years since he had graduated from East High. His high school years were definitely some of the best years of his life besides college. Following in his father\\'s footsteps he was the captain of the basketball team, bringing them two championships. He was also apart of the track team as well where he made it to state. Like his mother, he was very smart being one of the smartest in his class. Easy High was also where he fell in love. He met Danielle, the love of his life, on the first day of their freshman year. She was new to town and didn\\'t have any friends yet and he offered to show her around. The two became friends quickly and during the sophomore year the two started dating. Once he graduated high school, Dylan attended college in New York where he got a degree in law. He returned back to his home town when he got a job offer at one of the best law firms in town. His smile grew as he walked the halls of East High, all the memories flooding back. He walked past the \"Hall of Fame\" case that the school had. He smirked as the case held a lot about his family. It was pictures of his grandfather and both his parents along with himself and two of his siblings. I guess you can say that they were all East High Royalty. Of course his grandfather and father were basketball stars but his father also was an amazing swimming which one of his sisters had possessed. His father had led the team to many medals over the course of the four years he attended the school. His mother was on both the track team and volleyball team being the captain of both teams. She too had led the track team to state and the volleyball team had won two championships as well. As for his sisters, one being a senior and the other a sophomore had made names for themselves as well. Jessica was a senior who was the one who possessed their father\\'s trait of being an amazing swimmer. She was so good that she had many coaches coming up to her offering her a spot on their college teams. Emily, his youngest sister was a sophomore and had already made a name for herself on the basketball team. To say that their father was proud was an understatement. His youngest sibling, Ethan, was a freshman but he had no doubt that he would make his mark at East High as well. Dylan moved away from the case as he walked towards his father\\'s office. His father was the English Teacher at the school as well as being the Basketball coach every since he grandfather had retired after Dylan\\'s junior year. His mother was the head nurse at Albuquerque General Hospital. Dylan walked into the gym and smiled as he saw the loose balls everywhere. He knew that practice had just ended since on the first day of school practice was normally a free for all. A way for the coaches to see who had a possibility of being on the team. He walked towards the back and saw his father sitting at his desk going over paper work. He knocked and smiled as his father looked up at him. \"Dylan! What are you doing here?\" His father stood up as the two embraced each other in a hug. \"What I can\\'t come visit my dad?\" Troy laughed as the two sat down. \"I guess you can. How have you been? How\\'s work?\" \"I\\'ve been good. Work is going good. I\\'m hoping to get my own case soon.\" \"It\\'ll happen soon enough. You\\'ve been doing good there so don\\'t worry.\" \"How was practice? Any good players\" Dylan asked as his father sighed. \"Eh it was the same as always. I\\'m hoping I can whip this team into shape.\" Dylan laughed as his father was definitely the same as always. Very determined for that trophy. \"If anyone can do it dad you can.\" Troy laughed as he nodded his head. \"How\\'s mom?\" I haven\\'t talked to her since Saturday.\" Troy smiled at the mention of his wife of nearly 25 years. \"She\\'s good. Still working like crazy. She was kind of emotional today with Jessica starting her senior year and Ethan starting his freshman year. She said that were almost empty nesters.\" \"That\\'ll never happened, we\\'ll always be around.\" Troy rolled his eyes at the cheeky smile his son gave him knowing that the statement was definitely true. They all still have dinner together every other Sunday, where Dylan and Danielle even come. Troy looked over at his son and smiled looking at the exact replica of himself. Dylan was definitely Troy\\'s mini me it was scary. Gabriella always joked about how the only thing that Dylan got from her was his brain. Everything else was Troy from his eyes and hair to his personality. Looking at his son he knew something was up. Something about him was different, he just couldn\\'t but his finger on it. \"So Dyl, want to tell me the real reason you came to see me?\" Dylan looked over at his father confused. Looking at his face, he instantly knew it was no point in lying. His father could always read him like a book. Dylan sighed as pulled out the little black velvet box he had been carrying around for the last week. He tossed it to his dad, which he caught easily. Troy looked up at his son shocked before looking at the box. He opened the box and smiled at the beautiful 3.5kt princess diamond ring. \"Wow that\\'s definitely a beautiful ring. When are you going to do it?\" Dylan shrugged his shoulder as he ran his fingers through his hair. A clear sign he was stressed. \"I have no idea. I don\\'t know how to do it, when to do it, if she\\'ll love it. I just…I don\\'t know.\" Troy looked at his son with a small smile. He definitely understood what he was feeling. \"Son she\\'s going to love it. The two of you have been together since you were what, 15? You know her. You\\'ll figure it out. You just have to trust your gut.\" \"I just…I\\'m stressed dad. I mean I love the hell out of her. I know she\\'s the one for me. I mean I knew that in college even after that short breakup I knew she was the one.\" While Dylan went to New York for college, Danelle had went in LA. The two were always worried about the distance but both agreed to try it out. Things were going good until their junior year. Things got more stressful for the two and Danielle had broke it off. They were only apart for 6 months before Dylan flew to her explaining to her that he needed her and they would try harder to make it work. He loved her too much to let her go. They ended up getting back together and the two have been stronger then ever. Danielle had even moved back home with Dylan where she got a job at the same hospital as Gabriella as a nurse. \"I just…I know it\\'s time Dad.\" Troy looked at his son and wondered where the time went. It seemed like just yesterday he was teaching him how to walk and now he was sitting in front of him telling him that he wanted to propose to his girlfriend. \"I guess I really came to you to ask you how you proposed to mom. Where you nervous?\" Troy looked over at the picture of him and Gabriella on his desk. He kept all type of his pictures in his office of his family but this one particular picture was his favorite. Troy and Gabriella were 25 and 2 weeks into their marriage. Troy was holding Gabriella in his arms bridal style as they stood next to a sold sign. Troy had surprised Gabriella with a house as his wedding gift to them. The house was everything that Gabriella had wanted and when Troy presented her with the keys on their wedding day she had been overjoyed. \"Dylan I was beyond nervous the day I finally asked your mom to marry me…\" Troy stood in his bedroom that he shared with his girlfriend of 6 years. He bit his lip as he looked down at the box he was holding. The item in this box could either make or break his relationship. The 3.5kt ring stared back at him as he nervously thought about how he would present it to her. He had the box for a month and he knew he wanted to propose soon but he just had one more thing he had to take care of. \" Troy\" His head perked up at the sound of his girlfriend. He quickly put the ring in the drawer on his side of the bed. He turned around to see his girlfriend walking in their room dressed in her purple scrubs. Troy smiled as he walked over to her, pulled her in his arms and kissed her. \" Hey baby. How was work?\" \" Eh extremely busy. I\\'m so happy I have the next two days off.\" Gabriella said as she went into their bathroom. Troys ears perked up at that statement as he looked over at the drawer that held Gabriella\\'s ring. \" Babe.\" \" Huh\" Troy looked up to see Gabriella standing in the bathroom with her head tilt to the side. \" You okay?\" \" Yeah..yeah I\\'m fine. Come on we have to start getting ready for your brother\\'s graduation party.\" Gabriella smiled at that statement as she went back in the bathroom to start getting ready. He brother was last of the Montez trio to graduate from East High. They had moved to the neighborhood when her sister was starting her junior year of high school and Gabriella was starting her sophomore year. \" I can\\'t believe Anthony is finished with high school. I feel like we just graduated.\" Troy chuckled as he walked into the bathroom and wrapped his arms around Gabriella\\'s waist. He watched as she did her hair, smiling as she couldn\\'t have looked cuter. \" You know the first year of high school was a blur. Things didn\\'t start getting better until a certain someone showed up at East High.\" Gabriella blushed and shook her head as Troy laughed. \" I\\'m just messing with you baby. High school was fun and having you there made it ten times better.\" Troy pulled Gabriella into his arms as she smiled and ran her fingers through his hair. She kissed him lightly cause Troy to smile. \" That was cheesy.\" Troy smirked as he kissed Gabriella on her ear. \" Mmhmm but you love it.\" Gabriella shook her head as she pushed Troy out of the bathroom and continued getting ready. Since she was occupied, Troy walked over towards the dresser to retrieve the ring. He knew he had to do the final step soon and what better way then tonight. The two walked into the the backyard of the place that Gabriella had called home every since she was 15. She smiled at all of her family around to celebrate her brother. \" Ahhh Ella!\" Gabriella looked up to see her 26 year old sister, Isabella, running towards her. Her husband John right behind her. \" Izzy! I\\'ve missed you so much.\" The two sisters shared a hug before Gabriella hugged her brother in law. \" Troy, it\\'s good to see you okay. You treating my baby sister okay?\" Gabriella rolled her eyes at her protective sister as Troy laughed and wrapped his arm around her waist. \" Of course Izzy. You know I treat her like the princess she is.\" Gabriella blushed as the three laughed and Troy kissed her cheek. \" So Izzy where are Mom, Dad and Anthony?\" \" Anthony is around here somewhere with his friends, mom is inside and dad-\" \" Dad is right here.\" Troy and Gabriella turned around to come in contact with Eli Montez. \" Daddy!\" Eli laughed at his daughters excitement as he hugged her. \" Hey baby girl. Hey Troy. Good to see you\" \" You too sir\" Troy said as the two shook hands. \" How\\'s mom doing dad?\" Gabriella knew her mom was probably still having a hard time with Anthony graduating. She cried on his graduation and she\\'s pretty sure her mom had been crying today seeing as she did the same with Gabriella and Isabella. \" She\\'s been emotional all day. She keeps saying how this is the last high school graduation she\\'ll be throwing.\" \" You guys can always have another kid dad.\" Izzy said as their father rolled his eyes. \" Uh no thank you. I finally got all three of you out of the house.\" Eli chuckled at his daughters pretend shocked faces as his son walked over to them. \" Dad mom is looking for you. Hey Ella! Troy!\" Anthony hugged the couple once he noticed them. \" Hey man. Congrats again. You excited for LA?\" Troy asked as Anthony nodded. \" Hell yeah man! I can\\'t wait. The sun, the parties and the girls\" Anthony smirked as his sisters rolled their eyes. \" Don\\'t forget classes you bonehead\" Gabriella told him as she ruffled his hair and laughed when Anthony pushed her away. \" Yeah yeah I know. I\\'m just happy to finally be away from mom and dad. Don\\'t get me wrong, I love them but it\\'ll be nice to be away from the parents.\" \" Yeah well let mom have her moment right now. She\\'s emotionally.\" Izzy said as everyone laughed. \" Oh Eli all of my babies are together.\" Everyone turned to see Maria with tears in her eyes as the Montez siblings all groaned. \" Mommmm come on. Don\\'t cry.\" Anthony went over and hugged her as she shook her head and wiped her eyes and smiled at her children. \" I know I know. I just can\\'t believe my babies aren\\'t babies anymore. Oh we need a picture! John honey take this picture of them for us will you.\" The kids groaned again at their mother but went along with it for her sake. Troy smiled as he looked at Gabriella interact with her family. He always loved the Montez family. They were like his second family. He felt the ring in his pocket and bit his lip as he looked over at Eli. He knew this would be the perfect time to ask him since Gabriella was preoccupied. \" Hey um Eli can we talk..privately?\" Eli looked over at his daughter\\'s boyfriend as he noticed how nervous he looked. He nodded his head as the two walked into the house and down to his office. Troy closed the door as the two sat in the chairs in the office. \" What did you want to talk to me about son?\" Troy nervously rubbed the back of his neck. How the hell do you ask your girlfriend\\'s father for her hand in marriage. \" Well sir you know I love Gabriella more than anything. The past 6 years have been amazing with her. I have a ring already but I know how much you mean to her and I completely respect that. I hope that I\\'m the man you\\'ve always seen your daughter with which is why I wanted to ask you for your blessing in asking Gabriella to marry me.\" By the end of his speech, Troy\\'s leg was shaking. He had no idea how these words came out but they did. He only hoped that he got the answer he wanted. Eli looked over at the man he saw as a son. He looked down at the picture on his desk that he had of his family. Isabella was 18, Gabriella was 17 and Anthony was 10. Gabriella was always the child that he was the closest too. He loved all his children the same but their relationship was special. She told him absolutely everything and they still talk at least once a day. He looked back up at Troy and knew that he was nervous, I mean what guy wouldn\\'t be. \" You know Troy I knew that you and Ella had a special connection every since the first time I saw you two together. She has this smile on her face that only comes out when you are around. I knew you were a different young man by the way I saw you treat her. You treat her as the Queen she is. From pulling her chair out at dinner to driving her to school. Even when there was a thunderstorm, you would come over to make sure she was okay. Yes I know about those times you snuck in.\" Troy gave a little smile as he put his head down. Eli chuckled as he shook his head. \"I\\'m not mad. I\\'m actually happy. I would come in her room to check on her but she would be sound asleep in your arms. Once I noticed that you drove all the way to our house in a thunderstorm, I knew she would be safe with you. I actually knew this day was coming soon. I didn\\'t know when exactly but I knew it was happening.\" Eli looked down again at the picture and smiled looking at his youngest daughter and then back up at Troy. He nodded his head with a proud smile. \" Yes Troy, I give you my blessing to marry my daughter.\" Troy jumped up as the two men shared a manly hug. Troy had a wide grin on his face as he couldn\\'t believe Eli had said yes. I mean he hoped he would but to actually hear it! \" Now all I ask is that you promise to keep that same smile on her face\" \" Absolutely sir\" Troy nodded as Eli smiled before shaking his hand. \" Welcome to the family Troy. Now let\\'s get back to this party before they send a search party for us.\" \" Where did you and my dad go while we were taking pictures?\" Gabriella asked as her and Troy got ready for bed that night. Troy already knew she was going to question his absence. He had his answer prepared as he laid next to her. \" He was just showing me his new gulf clubs your mom bought him. We made plans to go golfing.\" Gabriella rolled her eyes as she rolled into Troy\\'s arm before lying on his chest. Troy smirked at the fact that she believed him as he ran his hands up and down her arm. \" So we are going on a date tomorrow.\" Gabriella looked up at Troy surprised as he just shrugged his shoulders. \" We haven\\'t been on one in a while and you have the day off so why not.\" Gabriella smiled as she moved into Troy\\'s lap before kissing him. \" That sounds amazing. What are we going to do?\" Troy chucked as he shook his head with a smirk. \" Now that my dear is a surprise.\" Gabriella pouted and crossed her arms causing Troy to laugh. \" Sorry baby but pouting won\\'t help.\" \" You\\'re mean\" Gabriella tried to move from Troy\\'s lap but he was quicker as he grabbed her waist causing her to squeal. \" Mmhmm I might be mean but trust me you\\'re gonna love it\" Troy nuzzled their noses causing Gabriella to smile and wrap her arms around his neck pulling him closer to her. \" With you Wildcat, I\\'m sure I will.\" Gabriella awoke the next morning to the sun blazing into their room. She rolled over hoping to cuddle into her boyfriend but felt nothing but cold sheets. She frowned as she opened her eyes to see Troy nowhere in sight. She knew he wasn\\'t at work because he had the month off and he would wake her if he left for the gym or the store. She turned to look at the time and noticed it was almost 10am. She looked around and was shocked to see a single rose next to a note on her side dresser. She smiled as she smelled the rose and grabbed the note. Good Morning Beautiful. I know you are a little confused as to why I\\'m not there next to you. Trust me it took everything in me not to stay in bed with you but I have to get everything ready for tonight. Don\\'t worry I won\\'t have you staying home alone all day. I want you to go and get your hair and nails done along with finding a pretty dress for tonight. I left you my credit card to use. Don\\'t even try to leave it because I took all of yours so you have to use mine. Taylor will be joining you so have fun and I\\'ll see you tonight at 7pm. I love you! XOXO Wildcat. Gabriella rolled her eyes at the note with a small smile. Of course he would take her cards she didn\\'t except any different from him but she couldn\\'t help but feel excited. A date with Troy Bolton was always amazing and she had a feeling this one would be amazing too. Troy sat in his car at 6:50pm. He was outside of their apartment trying to calm himself. He had spent all day getting ready for today. Everything had to be perfect. Gabriella deserved a perfect proposal. He reached in his pocket and pulled out the ring. He smiled as it looked beautiful. Just as beautiful as she did. He hoped she loved it. He had the ring, her father\\'s blessing, the location now all he needed was her answer. He prayed that it was \"Yes\". I mean she loved him right. If he was ready to take this step she definitely had to be ready. He shook his head of any bad thoughts as he looked back at the apartment building. He got out of the car as he walked inside. As he climbed the stairs he tried to regulate his breathing. He was beyond nervous but he didn\\'t Gabriella picking up on that. He gave off a small smile as she could pick up any emotion off of him. He could never hide anything from her but he needed to do it tonight. He stood before their door and took a deep breath before he knocked. 2 seconds later, the door opened to reveal his beautiful girlfriend. He hair was curled just the way he liked it and she had on a light pink, strapless summer dress that stop just before her knees. He tried his hardest not to groan and he push the thoughts that he shouldn\\'t be having right now out of his mind. It took everything in him not to just push her up against the wall and kiss her but he had to wait. His time would come. Hopefully. \" Hi handsome.\" Gabriella smiled as she watched her boyfriend take in her outfit. She hoped he would like it and by his reaction she knew he did. \" God Ella. You…you look beautiful.\" Troy took her hand and spun her around so he could get a better look at her. Gabriella giggled as she placed a quick kiss onto his lips. \" Thank you baby. You look pretty dashing yourself.\" Troy did a quick spin as Gabriella took in his baby blue polo and black slacks. \" Well with you on my arm, I had to make sure I was up to standard.\" Gabriella just shook her head as he pulled her in for another kiss. \" You ready?\" Gabriella nodded as she grabbed her purse and the two exited the building and walked to Troy\\'s car. \" So Wildcat, you gonna tell me where we are going tonight.\" Troy chucked as he shook his head. \" Nice try but no. Time will tell soon enough.\" Gabriella rolled her eyes with a small smile as she just sat back and let her boyfriend surprise her. Ten minutes later, Gabriella gasped as the two pulled into the parking lot of the new Italian Restaurant. \" Oh my God Troy!\" Troy laughed at his girlfriend\\'s reaction as the two exited the car. \" I hoped you would react this way.\" \" How did you get reservations?\" \" Ah that my dear is a secret.\" Gabriella just smiled as the two walked into the restaurant and were seated rather quickly. \" Get whatever you want baby. Tonight\\'s all about you.\" Gabriella felt her heart melt at her blue eyes boyfriend. Could he get any better. \" What\\'s all of this for?\" Troy smiled as he grabbed her hand and kissed the back of it. \" I just wanted to spoil you tonight.\" \" You spoil me all the time Troy.\" \" I don\\'t spoil you enough.\" Gabriella shook her head as she leaned over and kissed Troy. The two enjoyed a nice dinner together talking about their family, friends, work life and just about anything else. When it came time to leave, Gabriella was confused as to why they didn\\'t get dessert. No matter where they went, Troy always got dessert. Troy paid for the dinner and the two headed back to the car where Gabriella question his decision not to get dessert. \" Ah you see that is apart of part 2 of our date.\" \" Part 2?\" Troy chuckled as he shook his head at his girlfriends confusion. \" Ella we\\'ve been together for 6 years since when have our dates only included one part.\" Gabriella blushed and laughed as this was true. Even in high school their dates would have two parts. Sometimes dinner and ice cream or bowling and a walk through the park. \" Okay you\\'re right. Where to now?\" Troy shook his head with a smile as he handed her a blindfold. \" Put this on.\" Gabriella looked at Troy with her eyebrow raised as Troy rolled his eyes. \" Trust me. You know I\\'m not going to let anything happen to you.\" Gabriella giggled before taking the blindfold and placing it over her eyes. About 15 minutes later she felt the car stop and Troy get out the car. She squealed as she felt him pick her up from her side of the car and carry her. She laid her head on his shoulder as she felt him kiss the top of her head. She felt her feet touch the ground after 5 minutes. She knew they were outside, she just didn\\'t know where. \" Okay take your blindfold off.\" Gabriella did as she was told and gasp at what she saw. The two were standing on the roof top garden of their old high school. Troy had placed fairy lights all over and there was a blanket and basket sitting on the floor. She turned around with tears in her eyes as Troy brought her into his arms and wiped her tears away. \" Is this why we didn\\'t get dessert?\" Troy laughed as he nodded his head and ran his finger through her curls. \" Yea. I figured this is our spot and we haven\\'t been her in a while so why not.\" Gabriella smiled as she kissed Troy and pulled him towards the blanket. Troy sat down first as Gabriella sat in between his legs causing him to wrap his arms around her waist. The two laughed and shared stories as they enjoyed the desserts Troy had for them that consisted of Chocolate cover strawberries. \" So what\\'s your favorite memory of this spot.\" Troy asked as he rubbed his hands up and down her arms. \" Hmmm I would have to say when asked me out for the first time. I could tell that you were nervous but it was so cute.\" Troy laughed as he definitely remembered that. He had been thinking about asking her out all day and was scared as hell to do it. He finally had text her and told her to meet him at their spot where he had a rose and presented it to her before asking her out. \" That definitely is a good one. I would have to say when we found out that we had got into UCLA. I was so fucking happy that we were going to school together. It scared the hell out of me to think that we might be separated.\" Gabriella smiled as she kissed Troy lightly. That was a scary moment for her as well but when they found out they were going to school together it\\'s like a weight was lifted off her shoulders. She was going to her dream college with her dream guy. \" Dance with me.\" Gabriella looked at Troy confused before she watched him take his phone out and play their song \"This is why I love you\" by Major. She smiled as she took his hand and let him pull her into his arms as they danced under the stars. Gabriella places her head on his chest listening to his heartbeat as Troy smiled. He knew this was the moment. He knew he was about to change their lives forever. It was now or never. \" Hey Ella.\" \" Huh\" Gabriella pulled back to look at Troy and saw him looking up at the stars. She followed his gaze and got distracted by the stars. Stars have always fascinated her. Her and Troy use to lay out on her balcony or in his treehouse for hours just looking at them. She felt Troy pull on her hand so she turned to look at him but she scrunched up her eyebrows when she didn\\'t see him. She looked down and gasp when she saw him on one knee. Troy grabbed both of her hands in his as he took a deep breath. \" Baby meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me. When you walked into my life, everything got ten times better. We instantly became friends but soon I realized that my feelings for you were stronger than that. It took me a while to finally tell you but when you agreed to be my girlfriend you had made me the happiest man alive. I never knew I could love someone as much as I loved you. I would walk the earth ten times barefoot for you. When you hurt, I hurt and when you\\'re happy, I\\'m happy. My life mission is to keep you smiling and so far I have succeeded. I know we have had our bad times but they only made us stronger. I want you in my life forever baby. You\\'re my rock, my weakness, my strength, my everything. I\\'ve asked you many questions on the rooftop from being my girlfriend to asking you to be my date for prom but there is one more question I need to ask you.\" Gabriella watched with teary eyes as Troy took the box out of his pocket and opened it for her to see the gorgeous ring. She placed her hand over her mouth as she looked from the ring back to staring into Troy\\'s eyes. \"Gabriella Noelle Montez…will you marry me?\" Gabriella felt her heart beating fast. She couldn\\'t believe this was happening. She\\'s always dreamed of Troy proposing to her. To being his wife and now it was actually happening. Troy felt like hours had passed since he asked her the question but it had only in fact been 2 minutes. He felt his heart raced as he watched Gabriella. She had tears in her eyes and he had only hoped those were happy tears. \" Yes oh God yes I will marry you.\" Gabriella jumped into a shocked Troy\\'s arms. Yes! She had said Yes! Troy laughed as he pulled her closer to him and the two shared a hasty kiss. Pulling back Troy wiped her tears away with the pad of his thumbs before kissing her again. He pulled back as he remembered the ring and smiled down at her. \" I think this belongs to you.\" Gabriella\\'s breathe stopped as Troy placed the ring on her finger. She felt a spark run through her body as she looked at it. The ring was perfect! She looked up at Troy with a huge smile to see him mirroring her smile. She wrapped her arms around his neck as he wrapped his around her waist. \" Thank you Troy. This night…it was perfect. The dinner, the rooftop, God the proposal. Everything!\" Troy smiled as he nuzzled his nose with hers and kissed her soundly. \" You\\'re perfect baby.\" \"Wow\" Dylan sat back in his chair and smiled at the story he just heard. He always made fun of his parents showing PDA around the house but he secretly loved it. His father was never shy about showing his love for his wife around his children. He does it to show his sons how to treat a woman and for his daughters to see what true love is and how they should always be treated. \"Yea. Asking your mother to marry me was the best decision of my life.\" Troy traced Gabriella\\'s face in the photo with a smile as he looked up at his son to see him smiling as well. \"It was a great story dad. I\\'m glad you did it. You may have given me some ideas.\" Troy laughed at his son as he shook his head and place the photo back on his desk. \"My idea is off limits. You know your mother is going to ask how you did it.\" Dylan pouted as his dad was right. \"But you\\'re a Bolton and romance is in our blood. You know Danielle just as well as I know your mom. Everything will come to you and in the end she will love it and I will have a new daughter.\" Dylan smiled as he looked down at the ring. His dad was right once again. He knew everything about Danielle so and idea should come to him one way or another. \"Thanks dad for everything. For the advice, the story and how you raised me.\" Troy smiled as he hugged his son. He pulled back to see not the little 2 year old who would run up to him everyday after work to play basketball but a young man ready to take the next step. \"No problem son.\" There you all have it. To be honest this is my favorite story that I have written. I thought it was super cute and I don\\'t know I just love Troy! Tell me what you think in the reviews!']","Summary":" ['24 years old Dylan Bolton walked into his old high school, East High, with a smile on his face.

I think it\\'s about time I go ahead and make that step. I\\'m mean we\\'ve been together for four years and I know she\\'s the one so why not.\" My heart started to speed up and my head starting spinning as I listened to what Mark was saying. \"Are you sure?\" I asked as he looked at me. \"Of course I am Troy. You know Gabriella\\'s a great girl. Hell you know her better than anyone. Who wouldn\\'t want to marry her.\" I nodded my head as I stood up and walked towards the kitchen. \"I\\'m planning on taking her to dinner and doing it there.\" I frowned as Gabriella wouldn\\'t like that. She always told me she dreamed of her proposal happening in a park or beach at night. She hated the spotlight on her. \"That\\'s sounds great.\" I put on a fake smile as Mark smiled. I shook my head as I couldn\\'t deal with this right now. \"Hey dude we should probably call it a day. I have to get some work done before the game comes on.\" Mark shook his head as he finished off his work before grabbing his stuff. \"Alright dude. Hey I\\'ll call you tomorrow to let you know how it went. You already know you\\'re in the wedding. I mean I wouldn\\'t have her if it wasn\\'t for you.\" He slapped my shoulder as I once again put on a fake smile. Once he left, I groaned as plopped down on my couch with my hands in my face. I\\'m sure you\\'re wondering why I\\'m not happy for my friend. Well you see the reason is because I\\'m deeply in love with his girlfriend, my best friend of 17 years, Gabriella Montez. Gabriella and I have been friends since we were 7 when she moved next door to me. She was like the female version of me. We did everything together. I could always count on her and vice versa. I don\\'t exactly remember when everything changed. I think it had to be our junior year of high school. She had left for 3 months to spend the summer in New York with her dad. I had missed her like crazy. It was by far the hardest, most boring summer without her. We talked everyday but it wasn\\'t the same. The moment I saw her again, I knew something had changed. It\\'s like something had sparked between the two of us. I saw her in a completely different light. I mean she had always been beautiful but I had finally noticed how beautiful she was. I didn\\'t just see her as a sister or my best friend but as something more. I tried for years to tell her how I felt but I always chickened out. Once we graduated high school, I figured the feelings would go away but unfortunately that never happens. We ended up both attending NYU, me for business and basketball and her for nursing and basketball. That\\'s when we met Mark. He was my roommate and he would hang out with us from time to time. Durning our 2nd year, I had came back from a basketball game in Chicago when I discovered the two were together. I was devastated to say the least. Four years later and they are still together and my feelings for Gabriella are still there. It kills me to watch the two of them together. To hear him talk about her, to see him holding her or kissing her. I hate ever last part of it but she\\'s my best friend I can\\'t just walk out of her life because of my feelings for her. I guess Mark saying that he is going to propose really hurts because I could\\'ve stopped this from happening six months ago. I was up packing my bags for my three week business trip to California. I was nearly finished when my phone started ringing. I looked to see who it was when a smile crossed my face. \" Hey Ella. What\\'s up.\" \" Troy…\" My heart started racing as I noticed that Gabriella was crying. I stopped packing as I sat on my bed. \" Ella what\\'s wrong?!\" \" Can you…can you come over.\" I nodded my head as I ran to my living room throwing my shoes on. \" Of course. I\\'m on the way Ella okay…I\\'ll be there in ten minutes.\" I raced down my stairs and climbed in my car before making the ten minutes drive to her apartment. I had thousands of thoughts running through my head. I hated when Gabriella would cry and I knew she needed me. Once I reached her apartment, I hurried up and parked before running to her building. The reception let me up without signing in. I was here so much that they already knew who I was there for. I raced up to the 3 rd floor and down to her door. I knocked on the door as not even 2 seconds later, I was face to face with a tear stained Gabriella. I felt my heart skip a beat because even when she was crying she was beautiful. \" Oh Ella.\" I pulled her into my arms as I closed the door. She cried into my chest as I rubbed her back. I let her cry it out for ten minutes before I sat us down on her couch. \" You want to tell me what has you crying like this.\" I asked her as I moved a piece of hair behind her ear and she sniffed. \" Mark and I broke up.\" She said it in a whisper but I heard it loud and clear. I was secretly cheering insides but I kept my cool. I frowned as I looked down at her. \" Why?\" I felt her tense up as I knew it had to be something serious. \" I don\\'t want to talk about it.\" I didn\\'t want to push her so I just left it alone. I knew she would tell me when she was ready. \" Okay…well my flight doesn\\'t leave until 10 tomorrow so how about we break out the Vodka and watch some Family Guy.\" I offered her with a small smile as I rubbed her hair. She gave me a smile back as she nodded her head. I moved her off my lap as I went to go get the vodka and some glasses as she set the tv up. 2 hours later and many many drinks later we were definitely drunk. \" Troyyyyyyy why do you have to leave for three whole weeks?!\" Gabriella asked with a pout as I laughed. \" I have a job to do Ella.\" I slurred. \" But I\\'m going to miss you…\" \" I\\'m going to miss you too Ella.\" She pushed my shoulder as I just shook my head and started tickling her causing her to laugh. Before I knew it I was straddling her lap as she was under me still laugh. I stopped when I realized she needed to breathe. I looked down at her with a smile as I pushed some hair out of her face. I felt my heart start to speed up when I saw what position we were in. I could tell she had realized it too when she bit her lip. God the things I wanted to do to her lip. We looked at each other as I felt a force pull me towards her. I could have sworn I saw her lean in as well. Before I knew it we were kissing. I could taste her cherry chapstick and God she tasted wonderful. She tasted just like I dreamed she would. Kissing her was like being in a fucking cloud. It was like I was high in the sky and I never wanted to come down. I leaned up to position her in my lap. Her arms around my neck and my hands on her waist. We stopped kissing when air became important. She moved in my lap so she was straddling me and not even a second later her lips where on mine again. My hands worked their way under her shirt as she did the same. I groaned when she started to trace my abs. I pulled back to kiss her neck as she tried to catch her breath. \" Bedroom\" My body moved faster than my brain as I picked her up and ran to her room. Once there, I pushed her against the door as clothes were soon thrown all over the place. I moaned as she started to kiss my neck and she quickly found my sweet spot. I squeezed her waist as I couldn\\'t think straight. All I wanted was her. That\\'s all I ever wanted. I pulled her head back and slammed my lips onto hers as I picked her up and placed her on the bed. I kissed her stomach, then her chest, then her jaw before hovering over her lips. Both of our breathing becoming harder and harder with each kiss. I looked down at her as my heart fluttered. She looked so beautiful that I wanted to stay in this moment forever. \" Are you sure about this Ella?\" Even though we were drunk I didn\\'t want to push her. I would stop if she wanted me too. She bit her lip again as she nodded her head before giving me another mind blowing kiss. At that moment, I lost it….. I awoke the next morning with the sun blazing into the room. My head was banging and this sun was not helping. I started to roll over when I felt something on my chest. I looked down to see Gabriella laying on my chest naked. The blankets were covering everything below our waist. Memories of last night started to come back to my mind and all I could do was smile. I looked at my phone to see it was nearly 7:30. I groaned as I realized I was leaving today and I needed to leave now if I wanted to make it on time. Everything in me told me to wake her up but I knew she had work later on so I let her be. I quietly got out of bed, placing Ella on her pillow before collecting my things. I kissed her forehead before walking out of her apartment, not realizing I would regret not waking her up. While I was away, I acted like a total idiot. I started thinking that maybe what we did was wrong. Maybe Gabriella just saw it as a mistake. I started overthinking and it scared the shit out of me. When Gabriella had called me later that day, I didn\\'t even bring up the sex. I just played the entire thing off. She never said anything either so we left things at that. Over the three weeks, all I could think about was that night. How it felt to hold her, kiss her, be with her. I wanted more. I needed more. Once I flew back to New York, I drove straight to her apartment. I knocked on Ella\\'s door as I tried to steady my breathing. I knew what I was about to do was going to change our lives but I couldn\\'t wait any longer. I should have done this three weeks ago but that\\'s in the past. I smiled as I watched Gabriella open the door. \" Oh My God Troy!\" I laughed as she jumped into my arms. \" What are you doing here? I thought you weren\\'t coming home until tonight?\" I shrugged my shoulders as we walked into her apartment. \" I got out of my last meeting so I hopped on the next plane home. I missed you.\" She blushed as I watched her look at the floor. I took a deep breath as it was now or never. \" Look Ella..we need to talk about what happened.\" Her head snapped up as she looked at me. \" Troy…\" \" Gabs who was at the door?\" My head snapped to her room to see Mark walking into the living room. \"Troy dude what\\'s up.\" I looked over at Gabriella who was looking anywhere but at me. \" Hey what are you doing here?\" I asked confused. They broke up so why is he here. \" Gabriella didn\\'t tell you. We got back together.\" I felt my heart drop into my stomach. I looked over at Gabriella who bit her lip and nodded. \" Oh that\\'s um, that\\'s great man.\" Mark smiled as he pulled Gabriella close to him. I knew she could feel me looking at her as she wouldn\\'t meet my eyes. \" We were about to go get some lunch. You in?\" I rubbed the back of my neck as I shook my head. \" No I um need to get home but you two have fun. I\\'ll talk to you guys later.\" I walked towards the door as I felt Ella behind me. \" Troy..\" I shook my head as I put on a fake smile and turned to look at her. \" It\\'s fine Ella. I\\'ll see you later.\" I kissed her cheeked as I walked out of her apartment. Every since that day, I have regretted not talking about what happened sooner. She could be with me, we could be happy. Instead she\\'s about to get engaged to a man who I know isn\\'t any good for her. Don\\'t get me wrong, I love Mark like a brother but she should be with me. I groaned as I looked over at a picture of Ella and I. I shook my head as I couldn\\'t take this anymore. I jumped up, grabbed my keys and flew to my car. Once I reached her apartment I ran up the stairs to her floor before knocking on her door. Once she opened the door I noticed how surprised she looked. \"Troy what are you doing here?\" I looked at her as I noticed she had just got off work and probably was about to get ready for tonight. \"I need to talk to you.\" I walked into her living room as we both sat on the couch. I rubbed the back of my neck as I tried to steady my breathing. \"Troy are you okay?\" I looked at her as she looked concerned. It took everything in me not to just fucking kiss her. \"I love you.\" She nodded her head as she looked confused. \"I love you too Troy.\" I shook my head as clearly she wasn\\'t understanding what I was saying. \"No Ella. I love you. As in I\\'m in love with you.\" She looked shocked as she didn\\'t say anything. I knew I had to finish before I punked out again. \"I\\'ve been in love with you since we were 16. All I can think about is you. I\\'ve been holding these feelings in for so long and I can\\'t take it anymore. Whenever we\\'re in the same room, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. The moment you laugh or smile, my heart melts. I love being able to hold you and hug you. I figured that maybe it was safer not to say anything because I don\\'t want to ruin what we have, but I-I can\\'t do it anymore.\" I shook my head as I watched her process the new information. \"I love you Ella. I always have and I always will.\" \"Why now\" it sounded like a whisper but I heard it. I shrugged my shoulders as I couldn\\'t tell her the real reason. \"I don\\'t know.\" She stood up and shook her head as she backed away from me. \"Bullshit!\" I looked at her shocked as she looked angry. \"Ella I..\" \"No Troy. How could you do this?! How can you come over here and say all of this stuff now! Why now! Why not six months ago! You had the chance to say something and you didn\\'t. You just acted as if it never happened. We had sex Troy! No we made Love ! And instead of saying something you just left! We talked everyday and not once did you say anything. So why now huh?\" She was definitely pissed. I knew a pissed Gabriella and this was definitely that. I mean I couldn\\'t blame her. I sighed as I walked towards her. \"I know not saying anything sooner was a mistake. I know I should have told you. Please Ella understand that I love you! That night that we had sex was the best night of my life. When I woke up all I wanted to do was hold you. I know I should\\'ve left a note. I know I should have talked about it. I was an idiot. I thought that it would be best not to say anything. All I could think about was that night. When I came home and came to see you I wanted to tell you how I felt but then Mark was here.\" I watched her face drop as she shook her head. \"I\\'m sorry Ella I am but if I don\\'t tell you now I may never get the chance again to tell you that I need you. I need you so much Ella. I need for you to know what I\\'m feeling. If I don\\'t tell you these words I don\\'t know if I\\'ll be able to ever get the chance again!\" By this point I was standing right in front of her begging her to look at me. I lifted her face so that our eyes could meet. I rubbed her cheeks as I needed for her to understand. \"I love you Ella and I can\\'t say it enough. I was an idiot. I\\'ve been an idiot for so long because I should have told you way back in high school.\" She shook her head as if she was lost for words. I couldn\\'t blame her, I would be too. She walked away from me and I pulled her back to me. Before she knew it, I had kissed her. I could tell she was taken back but she kissed backed. I put everything into that kiss. Every ounce of love that I had for her went into that kiss. I pushed her up against the wall and placed my hands on her waist. One of my hands moved to rub her cheek as this was the best way I could explain everything. I felt her pull back before she pushed me off of her. \"You need to leave.\" She said as she looked down at the floor shaking her head. I couldn\\'t tell if she was shocked, pissed, sad or all three. \"Ella..\" \"Leave Troy!\" My shoulders slumped as I ran my hand through my hair and nodded before leaving. I turned around to say something but she had already closed the door. I placed my forehead on the door as I closed my eyes trying to stop the tears from falling. I rolled over in my bed for what felt like the thousandth time. I looked to see that it was 2:30 in the morning. I groaned as I haven\\'t been able to fall asleep in hours. All I could think about was what happened today with Gabriella. We didn\\'t talk to each other for the rest of the day. I figured it was useless since I knew she had dinner with Mark. I rolled my eyes as I figured that they were happily engaged by now. Probably celebrating their engagement. I sighed as I knew that I really would have to move on now. Gabriella was right…I shouldn\\'t have waited so long and now look at me. The love of my life just got engaged to another man. I\\'ll just have to suck it up. As long as she is happy, then I will be happy. I heard a loud knock come through the apartment as I frowned. It was late in the night so who the hell could be knocking. The knocking didn\\'t stop, so I hopped up and threw a pair of sweatpants over my boxers. I opened the door to come face to face with my best friend. \"Gabriella..what are you doing here?\" She Ignored me as she walked through the door. I looked at her confused as I closed the door and followed her to the living room. \"Ella…\" \"You knew didn\\'t you.\" She turned to look at me as I could tell she had been doing some serious thinking. \"Knew what?\" \"You knew that Mark was going to propose to me tonight didn\\'t you?\" I felt my body tense up as I dropped my head. \"That\\'s why you came over today! That\\'s why you said all of that stuff. You knew about this.\" \"So what if I did Gabriella! I told you that\\'s all the matters.\" \"So what?! Troy you had your chance to tell me before today! You had plenty of chances to tell me but now that you knew Mark\\'s plan you thought why not huh.\" I groaned as she was right. I hated when she was right. \"I know I know. I can\\'t stress enough how much of an idiot I am but I just…I couldn\\'t let it happen without you knowing.\" It got quite for a while as we just sat on the couch. Neither one of us daring to say anything. \"I guess I should congratulation you on your engagement.\" I mumbled as I rubbed the back of my neck. Gabriella shook her head as she looked over at me. \"There\\'s nothing to congratulate.\" I starred at her as I was confused. What does she mean? \"Huh?\" She raised up her left hand to show her fingers that were all empty. I looked at her shocked as she shrugged her shoulders. \"I said no.\" \"Why….\" We starred at each other as I think we both knew the answer. She got off the couch and walked over to me as sat in my lap. I instantly wrapped my arms around her waist as her went around my neck. \"I loved Mark but he\\'s not the man I see myself married too.\" I blinked my eyes at her as I couldn\\'t believe what I was hearing. \"What did Mark say?\" She sighed as she ran her fingers through her hair. \"He asked was it because of you. He said that he knew he would never have all of me because of you. That\\'s why we broke up six months ago. He was tired of having to compete with you.\" I looked at her stunned as this was the first time I was hearing any of this. I mean even Mark had never said anything to me. I couldn\\'t blame him, I probably would be pissed if I was in his shoes. I felt Gabriella run her hands through my hair, breaking me from my thoughts. I looked up at her to see her eyes sparkling. \"Call me crazy but you\\'ve always been the man I saw at the end of the aisle waiting for me.\" I smiled as we both leaned in for a kiss. This kiss was way better than earlier. It reminded me of the one six month ago but ten times better. She pulled back as she ran her fingers through my hair, looking into my eyes. \"I love you Troy. I\\'ve loved you since we were teens. Yes you were an idiot for what happened between us six months ago but I\\'m happy you finally said something.\" She kissed me soundly as I pulled her closer to me, if that was even possible. Pulling back I kissed her forehead as I connected our foreheads. \"You\\'ll always been the man for me Troy Bolton.\" I closed my eyes as I had been dreaming of her saying these words. \"Be mine.\" I whispered as she giggled before pecking my lips. \"Don\\'t you get it…I\\'ve always been you yours.\" I laughed as I nodded my head as I kissed her again. \"And you always will be.\" Hey guys! So what do you think? I just wanted to drop a cute little Troyella one shot. This is based off of the song If I Don\\'t Tell You Now by Ronan Keating.

He really has the most amazing eyes. A bright, crystalline teal, like sea glass. It takes my breath away, sometimes, when the light strikes it a certain way. It may sound cheesy, but it\\'s true. The color is so intense and clear you almost don\\'t think it doesn\\'t belong in nature. The effect his eyes can have is undoubtedly part of the reason for his popularity - a small part, compared to his sweet personality and his skill on the basketball court, but still. Taylor once told me, giggling, about how girls had been swooning over those big blue eyes since middle school. They certainly add up to the image he held for so long - perfect, handsome; East High\\'s very own Prince Charming. It seems like the heroes and heroines always have blue eyes in fairytales. And he was a fairytale hero, charging out onto the court to defeat the other team like a knight out to battle a dragon. I was even a little swept up in it when I first came to East High. I thought this beautiful, popular, blue-eyed boy might be my own fairytale. But as I got to know him, I realized he wasn\\'t some sort of fantasy prince. And that\\'s the best part. Troy is so much more than just the way people see him. He\\'s not always perfect. He\\'s insecure, impulsive, and sometimes cares so much about what others think of him that he hurts the ones he cares about. He has his own dreams, thoughts, and desires that go beyond what people expect from him. He may look like the stereotypical, all-American jock, and that may be why East High originally loved him. But somehow I knew, ever since I first saw those blue eyes on New Year\\'s Eve, that there was a real, flawed, complicated boy behind them. And that Troy, the real Troy, is the one I fell in love with. When I look into her eyes, I see home. Gabriella\\'s eyes are incredible. Honestly. People always seem to go crazy over blue or green eyes, but that\\'s just because they haven\\'t seen hers up close. They\\'re a deep, velvety brown that draws you in like the door to a warm cabin. The color reminds me of the hot cocoa my mom would make at Christmastime, rich and comforting and incredibly special, since it\\'s rare for Albuquerque to get cold enough for it. She, of course, is incredibly special, too. Something about her gaze makes me feel anchored, peaceful. When we sing together, the whole world seems to vanish as we lock eyes, and it\\'s just us. Our voices, our music, our connection. Gabriella may have been the first person to look at me like she really wanted to understand who I was deep down. Most people didn\\'t seem to recognize that there was more to me than what they saw, but somehow, she could tell that there was a whole side that just hadn\\'t been awoken yet. And I could see it in her, too. Gabriella made me brave enough to be who I truly am. Whenever I meet the soft twinkle of her eyes, I feel like I know exactly where I belong and who I\\'m supposed to be. I don\\'t worry about being judged, or being perfect, or living up to everyone else\\'s expectations, and I know she doesn\\'t either. She makes me feel at home in my own skin. That girl, the one who connects with me like no other, is the only one I could\\'ve fallen in love with. A/N: This is just a quick drabble I popped out because I\\'m feeling rusty. Credit where credit\\'s due; I got the inspiration for this from another piece called \"Eyes\" written by Muirin007 on DeviantArt (can\\'t link it unfortunately), though that one was for \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and not HSM. The concept of that fic inspired this, but all the content is mine.

I do not own, nor claim any ownership to the song either all credit goes to the songwriters and pruducers. Pairings: Troy Bolton/Ryan Evans Warnings: Slash Word Count: 18,354 He really didn\\'t feel like being here right at this moment, he doesn\\'t have to \\'spy\\' on the staff members anymore, not now that his sister had dropped him, left him alone after everything. He didn\\'t like how she is treating Troy, how she has taken their safe haven, their territory and turned it into her own. He didn\\'t want to be here, not like this. Not surrounded by this group of people. Not with the people who had, for all intent and purposes, made conspiratorial jabs and whispered insults at his sister and himself all throughout the lead up to the Winter Musical. Not with the people who turned their taunts on Troy Bolton, their team captain and leader simply for his willingness to speak to him and for wanting to develop some form of friendship with himself during the production. The people who are always spouting spiels about sticking together and working as a team, supporting each other through their choices, through thick and thin and yet, it was those same people who had turned their back on their best friend when he had needed them the most, when he had stopped acting according to their expectations of him. He tries not to outwardly glare at the hand Gabriella places on his shoulder as if trying to hold him in place, trying to not show just how angry he is at them for what he had overheard them doing. He ignores her large, brown, pleading eyes as she attempts to stare him down, to make him cave to her wants. He ignores the rest of the Wildcats looking at him with equally expectant expressions. Now having an idea of what Troy must have been feeling when they had cornered him the other day trying to convince him to do the Talent Show, all those expectant stares feeling as if they are staring into your very soul as they heap the pressure up, trying to force him back into their moulds. Not that Troy did. Neither is he going to. \"I know what you can do, Ryan. So, why not do it for us?\" Ryan tries not to flinch at the false innocence he can see in the manipulative girl\\'s face. She is virtually asking him the impossible. Asking him to turn his back on his closest companion, his best friend, his twin sister. Although, Sharpey isn\\'t topping his list of favourite people right now and she did leave him high and dry for this years\\' upcoming talent show but she is still his sister. The person who has been there for him since the beginning. They have absolutely no right to ask such a thing of him. Especially when they are, most likely, going to ditch him as soon as he has given them what they want, until he is no longer useful to them. \"No, thank you.\" His voice unwavering as he subtly shakes the offending appendix off his shoulder making sure to take a small step back as he sees the pleading gazes turn to steely glares. A personal slight against them he is sure. A shuddering of fear spikes through his spine, his mind unwillingly casting back to when he received a few beatings from some of the same basketball players now standing before him for being the \\'Theatre King\\' or for the simple fact of being related to Sharpey. \"Come on, Ryan. It\\'s not like you owe anything to Sharpey. She\\'s the one that left you all on your own. Replaced you with Troy, so why not help us out a little? You know you won\\'t get another chance to showcase your skills.\" Gabriella states with such certainty, such clarity that Ryan can\\'t help but sense a sinking feeling in his chest, knowing that he will, most likely, stay in Sharpey\\'s shadow, stay as her queer, flamboyant accessory. Her \\'Poodle.\\' Ryan watches as she makes to step towards him, his muscles stiffening slightly. He shoves his hands deep into his pockets trying to look casual, nonchalant as he gazes over the congregation of classmates before taking another cautious step backwards, skirting the girl\\'s reach. \"Thank you for the offer, but I must decline. I am sure I can work things out for myself and don\\'t want to be used simply for my talents.\" A muttering of discontent runs through the crowd before him as he takes yet another step back trying to keep as much distance between himself and the disappointed Wildcats. He watches wearily as Chad Danforth, supposed best friend and honorary brother of Troy Bolton, takes a threatening step forward. His voice deep and rumbling with malice. \"What\\'s that supposed to mean?\" Ryan doesn\\'t answer, simply turning his back and begins to make his way towards the changing rooms just down the way hoping for a safe place to sit and wait. He would rather not reacquaint his face, nor any other part of himself, with the fists of Chad Danforth. Gabriella\\'s words whirl through his mind, leaving a cold, empty feeling in his chest as he sits down upon a bench in the members only locker room, trying to ignore the sour taste in his mouth. The girl having unknowingly, or knowingly, his one of his many insecurities. Yet, he is certain that he made the right decision. If they were so willing to shun Troy, Primo boy of East High, star player and Captain of the basketball team just because he decided to be proactive when it comes to his future, because he is focusing on the scholarship which is going to set up his beginnings. The it would be that much easier to disregard Ryan, himself, after the talent show as well. Especially seen as it was Troy who managed to convince Mr Fulton, stressed out, high-strung manager of Lave Springs Country Club to hire all of them in the first place. The staff game had ended a few minutes ago, the Wildcats having won if the cheers and chants he heard was an indication and just as Ryan had predicted, Troy, loyal to a fault comes running across the fields towards the softball pitch, throwing a baseball jersey over his head as he goes. He watches from the shadows as Troy comes to a halt, his shoulders slumping at the deserted field before him, his body drooping as he all but collapses against the metal fencing when he finds his friends absent. The movement causing the sounds of clinging metal echoes through the air. Ryan watches in worried silence as Troy slams his fist into the dirt floor when he slides down to his knees, once, twice, thrice. No doubt causing significant bruising to his knuckles. He takes this as his cue to approach the distressed team, his heart aching at the self-loathing rolling from Troy\\'s body in waves. He ignores his mind telling him to turn away, to leave the boy alone. \"Hey, are you alright?\" Voice barely above a whisper, afraid that the teen will ignore him in favour of his own whirling thoughts, not wanting to open up to him. Even though had talked many times and hung out during the rehearsals of \\'Twinkle Town\\' they were by no means, what people would call, friends. Troy jumps, his head shooting upwards, not having noticed the approaching teen, his eyes portraying the dismay and self-loathing he is feeling as his ocean-blue eyes meet Ryan\\'s sky-blue ones. His shoulders slumping in what Ryan hopes is relief when he finds the other boy standing above him with heart-stopping concern shining in his gaze. \"Oh, hey Ryan. Yea, I was just…\" Trailing off Troy lifts his uninjured hand to his hair, tugging furiously clearly frustrated with himself even as his cheeks burn with embarrassment for being caught in such a vulnerable position. An action Ryan finds heart-wrenchingly adorable. He averts his gaze, his entire posture screaming of hopelessness which makes Ryan\\'s insides clench painfully, saddened by the drastic change in the usually cheerful teen. \"Looking for your friends?\" Ryan finishes for him gently, his voice soft and warm as he crouches down on the floor in front of the other boy. He places a hesitant hand on Troy\\'s shoulder in comfort, trying not to show his trepidation as his thoughts whirl around thinking that Troy wouldn\\'t want to accept any form of comfort from Sharpey\\'s lapdog. Though his anxieties are unwarranted when Troy leans into his touch, some of the tension leaking from his strained muscles pulling a small smile from Ryan. \"Yeah. I promised them that I would play in the staff Baseball game but…\" He sighs, dragging his hand through his already mussed hair, it comes away slick from the small layer of sweat still covering him from his, no doubt, extensive practice with the college guys from the University of Albuquerque earlier that day. Shifting his weight slightly, Ryan lets his eyes travel down the length of Troy\\'s hunched form his eyes filling with sadness. A sadness which is reflected in the other boy\\'s eyes, something which stirs his previous anger at the other Wildcats, Troy\\'s teammates , for leaving their friend in such a state. \"Don\\'t worry so much about it. You are trying to secure yourself a good future. Everyone has their own to plan and it is full of uncharted waters, especially with several people all aiming for the same goals. I think it is good that you are fighting for what you want.\" \"That\\'s just the thing…\" Troy begins, chewing his bottom lip between his teeth as he hesitates, his thoughts weighting on his mind trying to size up the benefits of opening himself up to the boy sitting across from himself. \"I don\\'t know if that is what I want to do anymore. I have always played basketball because it was what my dad always expected me to do. He always pushed me to be the best and it\\'s all he focused on, I just don\\'t know if I want to continue with it now.\" He confesses slowly, his eyes closing as if ashamed of his true feelings on the matter; as if he fears what Ryan, a boy he hardly knows, would think of him now that his most well-guarded secret is out in the open for the other to pick apart and judge. But Ryan doesn\\'t judge him. He simply smiles softly despite Troy not being able to see and squeezes the other boy\\'s shoulder in reassurance. Trying to tell him that it\\'s all right to think like that, to be unsure of where his future is heading because he is a teenager simply trying to find out who he truly is. \"I think… it depends on what you feel is right in your heart. If you are only doing basketball and trying for this scholarship because it is what your dad and everyone else thinks you should do, then is it really for you? What would you feel like a few years down the line? Would you regret not going for something you want to do?\" Ryan replies carefully, wisely. Wondering what exactly caused Troy Bolton, revered star player to rethink his entire future, to consider giving up basketball and ponder his life choices even as he fights to keep his friends close, his girlfriend happy, placate his dad and Sharpey all while trying to gain a scholarship he is not even sure he wants. \"I don\\'t think I want to continue basketball to be honest. Since the Winter Musical I have been pondering on following in your footsteps, Ryan. Trying out for a Drama, acting, or singing scholarship instead. I found that I really enjoy performing and I feel really comfortable on stage even if I am not the best dancer. I am not entirely sure though. What if, like you said, I regret it in the future? What would my dad think or do if I told him that I didn\\'t want to play anymore?\" Troy opens his eyes slowly, looking up into Ryan\\'s sorrowful gaze, his own swimming with uncertainty almost as if he were begging Ryan to save him from drowning in his own emotions and feelings. He slowly lifts a shaking hand up to grip hold of the one still resting on his shoulder, the warmth helping to calm himself, ground him. Holding onto it as if it\\'s his only lifeline. Ryan smiles warmly at the uncertain teen, the expression making him look much younger as he squeezes his shoulder offering him strength. \"I think that is something only you can decide. If your dad doesn\\'t consider your own feelings in the matter and doesn\\'t support you then, no matter what is said, it is not your fault. You shouldn\\'t continue to do things simply to please those around you. If you believe that you are destined for something other than basketball, then I say go for it.\" Troy stays silent, his eyes glazing over as he ponders Ryan\\'s words feeling himself relax as he knows now that no matter what he decides to do he will have the other teen\\'s full support. Though not really understanding exactly why Ryan is going so far to calm him down, to reassure him that he does have control over his own future despite what those around him say about it. \"I know everyone thinks of me as \\'Sharpey\\'s poodle,\\' her loyal lave to do her bidding but I can understand what you are going through, some of it at least.\" Ryan whispers, taking Troy\\'s silence for something else making Troy snap back into reality eyes wide with surprise and compassion. \"Not everyone thinks that about you Ryan… I certainly don\\'t. You have helped me so much. During the Winter Musical, rehearsals, handling Sharpey, and even today. I know for a fact that that is not something your sister would ever do.\" The corners of Troy\\'s lips quirk up into the starting of a smile, his eyes regaining some of their usual sparkle as Ryan inwardly cheers knowing that he is at least helping the other in some way, despite his less than stellar experience with social interactions. He knows that many people think he is just as popular as his sister, just as spoilt and demanding when it comes to things he wants but its not the case. He is always in her shadow, always being made to follow behind her, forgotten until someone needs his directory or chorographical skills. \"Listen, I\\'ll tell you a secret.\" Ryan states, shifting his weight as he rests fully on his knees, ignoring his background thoughts complaining about the stains he is likely going to have on his designer trousers after this. He waits patiently until Troy lifts his gaze back to his own, his eyes confused but holding a hint of some elusive emotion Ryan can\\'t quite place. \"I used to play baseball. Little league, Rhode Island, Junior championship. I played for my dad, he was so excited when he led me onto the pitch every game. His eyes would light up with pride every time I would hit a home run or every time I pitched a perfect ball. I didn\\'t want to disappoint him. But in the end, I figured out that I didn\\'t really like playing, even though I was good. I only did it because I wanted my dad to be proud of me for something. It made me miserable.\" Ryan looks down at his lap, sitting down heavily on his feet as he shuffles closer to Troy, never having told anyone, not even his own sister, why he had decided to quit baseball even before they had moved to a new city. He feels Troy squeeze his hand gently and smiles a little, feeling himself relax as he meets the other reassuring gaze. He could find no judgement. \"My dad was so disappointed with me. I hated it. I knew that it was my fault, but I didn\\'t like the idea of continuing something I wasn\\'t happy with just to please my dad, so I quit. Threw my mit on the ground and never looked back. I took up dance lessons and threw myself into my acting and choreography.\" Ryan finishes with a wistful sigh, releasing tension in his body that he hadn\\'t realised he had been holding onto, that had been building up as he feels another squeeze on his hand, looking up he sees Troy smiling softly at him, highlighting a small dimple in his right cheek which Ryan finds oddly endearing. His eyes glittering with their usual cheerfulness. \"Thank you for trusting me with this, Ryan. I just can\\'t help but think that everyone is right though, they are all saying how I am a completely different person; that they don\\'t recognise me anymore. Does focusing on my scholarship, on my future really make me such a bad person?\" He questions, his shoulders slumping once again as his mind seems to go back over all of the conversations he has held with his friends and parents over the past few weeks. His eyes glazing over and filling with such s deep melancholy that makes Ryan\\'s heart clench and ache in his chest as does the change in topic. Ryan drops his hand from Troy\\'s shoulder, shifting his weight into a more comfortable position as he slowly, carefully rests his hand on top of the other\\'s injured one, gently caressing the appendix resting on Troy\\'s lap. He hates hearing the bitterness which creeps into Troy\\'s voice as he speaks about his friends; about his teammates, wanting to wipe away all the hurt the other boy is feeling. \"Of course, they are not! Yes, you may be slightly different then before summer started but why does that have to be a negative thing? Maybe you have just grown up. Maybe you are just facing up to your responsibilities. You are not a bad person, Troy no matter what anyone else says, you are a sweet, caring guy, kind and compassionate. That hasn\\'t changed.\" \"You really think so?\" His voice is uncertain, wavering as his eyes turn distant almost begging as tears well up in their corners. Willing himself to believe Ryan\\'s words, to toss away the hurtful words his teammates have shouted at him and all the things they have accused him of, to forget the heartache they have caused him. \"Troy, you are working as a Junior Gold Pro Instructor; playing against college guys, the big leagues; dealing with my sister, which I know is not an easy task and trying to placate all the people around you by trying to live up to so many different expectations. Few people are able to do all of that and not break.\" Troy smiles shyly at the Drama King, feeling flattered and flustered at the mere thought that Ryan could honestly feel like that about him. An odd warmth spreads through his chest, a feeling of elation he hasn\\'t felt for such a long time grows as he stares into the boy\\'s unwavering gaze. Knowing that Ryan believes everything he has just said 100%. \"But…Chad…he and the guys… they were upset that I never asked for them to be involved in the practice this morning.\" Ryan frowns thoughtfully, recalling just how quickly Chad and the other Wildcats had turned their backs on their friend and brother, how they had wrongly accused Troy of bailing on them in front of the RedHawks, how they had dismissed his efforts to apologise; dismissed the trouble Troy was in when trying to balance everything he was expected to do. He can feel his anger rising, beginning to bubble in his veins. \"I say let them be mad, you have absolutely nothing to warrant them being mad at you.\" \"But they…\" Troy slumps forward, his head coming to rest on Ryan\\'s shoulder heavily as he slowly turns his hand around holding onto the warm appendix still brushing against his own. He takes a deep calming breath and relaxes into Ryan\\'s surprisingly sturdy frame. Taking in as much as the strangely comforting feeling he feels when Ryan wraps his free arm around his shoulders without any hesitation. \"Like I said, Troy. Sometimes you need to do what is best for you, what you think is right no matter what anyone else has to say or think.\" He whispers softly, his hand rubbing soothingly at Troy\\'s neck, trailing down to his lean shoulders trying to offer as much comfort as he can to the destressed teen. His heart sinking ever so slightly, anxieties rising as he can\\'t help but feel like he is making Troy\\'s mood worse then what it had been when he found him. \"I suppose you are right, I just don\\'t seem to know what I want anymore. Everyone seems to think that I am this \\'new Troy,\\' that I have changed too much.\" \"Well if that is the case…\" Ryan starts hesitantly, pulling away from the older boy enough to coax Troy into a vaguely sitting position, arms still wrapped around each other, so he can once again look into the mesmerising ocean-blue orbs. Taking a deep breath, he brushes the loose hair away from Troy\\'s forehead smiling timidly at the basketball player. \"I kind of like this \\'new Troy.\\' Despite everything being thrown at him, he is able to continue giving it his all. Besides…\" He pauses dramatically, allowing his lips to turn up into a smirk as Troy raises an eyebrow in question watching him with full attention. \"You dress better now.\" His words have the effect he desired, Troy chuckles softly, his eyes sparkling slightly as his lips pull into the first true smile Ryan has glimpsed in days. Feeling accomplishment settling in his chest he squeezes Troy\\'s hand once more before slowly pushing himself to his feet, brushing his knees off before offering a hand to help the other boy up as well. \"Thanks, Ryan.\" \"No worries. I don\\'t like seeing you so upset.\" He confesses timidly, wondering if he is overstepping any boundaries somewhere, not knowing how Troy will take his admission. He feels himself relaxing though when Troy simply smiles a little wider at him. \"When was the last time you ate?\" Troy startles at the seemingly unexpected question, frowning in thought as he tries to cast his mind back to that morning. \"Hours ago. Before the RedHawks practice session.\" He answers honestly, watching as Ryan nods his head in thought. He turns back to the building and gestures for Troy to follow behind him as he begins to make his way towards the club. \"Same, how about I call for some room service while I take a look at your hand?\" Without giving Troy much of a choice in the matter, Ryan takes the others hand leading the non-protesting teen through the empty corridors of Lava Springs, towards his bedroom. Opening up his door he allows Troy to step into the large room before he follows, closing the door as he walks over to the other side, toward his desk. After some rummaging in his cupboards, Ryan exclaims brightly when he locates a small green first aid kit. Turning back to Troy, Ryan smiles reassuringly as he sits down on his king-sized bed, patting the space next to himself invitingly watching as the other makes his way towards him slowly. His eyes wide as they take in the sophisticated décor, the posters littering the wall from different musicals and the huge walk in wardrobe next to the en suite bathroom. \"What would you like to eat?\" \"Pizza?\" Troy questions quietly, his stomach giving a loud rumble at the mere thought of having food in front of them in a few minutes making Ryan chuckle. The soft sound making Troy\\'s heart beat speed up as he vows to try and make the other laugh more often. He sits down next to Ryan, leaning back casually only for his cheeks to burn with all the blood rushing through his veins, his fingers tingling as he accidentally brushes them against Ryan\\'s. Feeling smug when he catches sight of a pale flush dusting the other\\'s face as well. \"Sounds good.\" After placing the call for their meal, meat feast pizza with drinks, Ryan carefully takes Troy\\'s injured hand in his own, placing it in his lap as he inspects it before cleaning up the abrasions and cuts with practiced ease. He wraps the hand in a thin, white bandage caressing it lightly when it is done. Placing a soft kiss to the knuckles without thought. Looking up he blushed slightly when he realises what he has done. Troy ignores it, the action feeling right between them. He locks gazes with Ryan, his expression one of fascination, awe, and curiosity. \"Why were you out at the softball field, Ryan?\" He asks, no hint of accusation in his voice like the other Wildcats, no direct \\'did your sister send you to spy on us?\\' like Chad Danforth has asked him. Nothing akin to suspicion underlying his tone because, unlike everyone else who assumes that just because he had a deep passion for Drama and Theatre he couldn\\'t have other interests. Troy knew differently, he understood. Smiling sheepishly, Ryan rubs the back of his neck tugging gently at the hair there. \"Gabriella and Taylor invited me to join the staff game. I joined first because I wanted to scope them out see what they were planning for the talent show, Sharpey asked me to and because I had nothing else to do I thought I would see.\" He says embarrassed at what he had been trying to do, he didn\\'t want Troy thinking badly of him didn\\'t want him to change his mind about him being Sharpey\\'s lapdog, her poodle. \"I knew that you were having a rough time with all of this as well. That, no matter what your teammates said about you, I knew you are loyal to a fault and would try your hardest to make it to the staff baseball game. I wanted to make sure you were all right, that you were dealing with everything.\" His voice shakes as he clasps his hands together in his lap, not having the courage to look up into Troy\\'s face as he confesses his more selfish reasoning behind his presence. He didn\\'t want to see the confusion or heaven forbid, the disgust marring Troy\\'s beautiful features. He, therefore, gasps softly when he finds himself being pulled into a tight embrace, he feels Troy burying his face into the crook of his neck as he takes a shuddering breath as if trying to stop himself from crying. Ryan quickly hugs him back, rubbing a hand up and down the boy\\'s spine while tangling the other into his hair, wanting to hold the teen together. \"Thank you, Ryan. For being there for me, for looking out for me. No one has ever…\" He breaks off, choking on the overwhelming emotions constricting his throat. \"No problem, Troy. I would do it again in a Heartbeat. I don\\'t like how they have been treating you recently, how they are blaming you for everything going wrong for themselves this summer. I don\\'t like seeing you so downtrodden, I had to do something.\" Ryan smooths a hand through Troy\\'s hair, smiling despite the tears welling up in the corners of his eyes as he remembers the completely \\'kicked puppy\\' look Troy had shown when Chad had first called him up on something beyond his control. His promotion. He feels the other\\'s shoulders shuddering as Troy draws in another deep breath, indicating to his own fragile emotional state as he cuddles closer to Ryan\\'s heat. \"Hey Ry…?\" The soft voice, uncertainty echoing through his tenor, draws Ryan\\'s attention, his cheeks flushing at the nickname making their position seem more intimate then it was. He hums in responds, stroking his hand through the dark blond locks like he has wanted to do since he had met him. \"Do you think we would be able to sing together at some point?\" Ryan\\'s hand freezes in Troy\\'s hair accidentally pulling the strands. Not entirely sure why the basketball player would even want to sing with him. Why he would want to perform, even if were just by themselves, with Sharpey\\'s shadow, the lesser of the Evans twins. \"I mean… I would like to. You are easier to talk to and less overbearing and because of all the support you have given me I feel like you would be the one to help me decide if singing and stuff is really for me. And I like your voice, its calming and so mesmerising when you sing.\" Troy rambles nervously, taking Ryan\\'s tense posture, frozen actions, and lack of response as a negative to his request. Ryan realising where Troy\\'s thoughts were going hug the older boy closer, starting up his motions once more trying to alleviate the other\\'s raving emotions. He chuckles softly at the word vomit. \"I would be honoured to sing with you Troy. I think our voices will go well together.\" He counters, his smile widening as Troy nods his head against his shoulder, elation filling his chest cavity at the prospect of having a friend who prefers to hang with him instead of his sister, someone to hang out with him just because they want to and not because they are trying to get closer to Sharpey. Someone who genuinely likes his company. knock knock knock \"Room Service.\" A soft voice calls through the door causing the two boys to jump, pulling away from each other, their cheeks stained pink in embarrassment before they quickly break into quiet chuckles. Ryan makes to stand off the bed in order to collect their food when he feels a small pressure on his hand and fights to keep the blush from reforming when he realises Troy has taken hold of it. Trailing his eyes from the appendix to Troy\\'s face, he squeezes their hands feeling butterflies fluttering in his chest as he watches Troy lift his hand up placing a soft kiss to the back of his knuckles much like he had done earlier. \"Thank you, Ryan.\" Troy whispers, a blush dusting his own cheeks, spreading down his neck, smiling shyly up at the younger teen who feels himself loosing his own fight as his face flushes with heat. Nodding his head in stunned acknowledgement, Ryan gently pulls his hand away making his way to the door. He quickly grabs their food, hurrying back to the bed with the steaming box, he sits back down next to Troy, neither noticing the disappearing distance between their bodies as they tuck into their meal. Ryan sees Troy off, albeit reluctantly, he was having a lot of fun talking to the basketball player and hated cutting their time short due to the other boy\\'s parents expecting him home soon, his dad on his way to pick him up. He is expecting them to part ways with nothing of significance, to shake hands and cement their relationship, if it could be called that, as mere friends if not close acquaintances. To keep whatever has happened today within these past 24 hours. TO put all of this behind them and act like nothing has changed between them come tomorrow. Instead, he is pleased to not that Troy seems just a reluctant, just as hesitant as himself as he watches the taller boy biting his lower lip. He watches as Troy\\'s eyes dart back and forth nervously, his gaze roaming Ryan\\'s body discreetly as he shifts his weight ever so slightly. \"Thanks – he clears his throat – Thank you for being there for me today, Ryan.\" \"Hey.\" Ryan calls softly in response to the other boy\\'s nervousness, placing his hand on Troy\\'s shoulder he stares into the glittering blue eyes. Getting lost in the reflective surfaces, stars twinkling in their depths. \"It was my pleasure. I meant what I said earlier, Troy. All of it. I like this \\'new you.\\'\" Troy laughs softly, clearing his throat again as he shuffles closer to Ryan, his eyes flickering out towards the country road when he sees the small glow of approaching headlights. \"I will see you tomorrow, right?\" He asks, his smile soft and almost shy as he gazes into Ryan\\'s eyes, gaze flickering towards the gates quickly where he can now see the approaching silhouette of his dad\\'s car pulling into the parking lot, the horn blaring loudly against the silent night. Sighing, he turns back to Ryan who is smiling up at him brightly. \"You can bet on it. I look forward to it.\" Ryan smirks causing Troy to blush in the darkness, smiling back winningly, no sigh of his early melancholy dancing in his eyes, no shadow cast over his features as his cheeks burn. Ryan watches with a wistful sigh as Troy sighs unhappily, scowling at the car sitting idle waiting for him, hefting his duffle bag up onto his shoulder. \"Great, I will look forward to it as well, but I need to go.\" Ryan follows Troy\\'s nod towards the car, hesitating a moment before he draws the older boy into another quick embrace, relishing at the warmth which surrounds him once more before it\\'s gone. He watches Troy scurrying off towards the car, waving back at him enthusiastically before climbing into the vehicle. Feeling a sense of optimism rising in his chest as he stands under the velvet sky watching the taillights fading into the darkness. Troy has never felt so exhausted, not even after their multiple daily practices leading up to the championship game. He feels, quite frankly quite terrified, horrified at what he has just had to witness, what he had just been a part of. How could anyone stand to have such violent explosions going off at such a proximity to themselves? Never mind all of the sparks and the loud bass beat running through their feet making their teeth chatter, it honestly mystified him. Walking through the virtually empty halls of the country club after what he believes to have been a disastrous rehearsal with Sharpey and her Sharpettes. He feels an internal pull as he walks past one of the recreational room/practice studios where he can hear the soft spiels of music playing through the air. Subconsciously moving his feet towards the sound, Troy is amazed and slightly awed by the sight laid before his eyes. Ryan is dancing around the room, his body doing an assortment of flips, twirls, jumps, and other complicated movements as he travels to the beat, dancing effortlessly, gracefully in front of the mirrored wall. Troy, leaning against the door frame, watches the figure, finding himself captivated with the rippling muscles, his eyes trailing the length of the boy\\'s body. Roaming from the tight black t-shirt pulled taut across a toned chest, a beautiful contrast with his pale skin, to the tight beach shorts gripping to a defined backside and thighs. Ryan\\'s hair is pressed to his forehead by the tiny amounts of sweat he had built up, as his chest expands, rising and falling with deep heaving breathes. But, it is his eyes which Troy cannot help but notice, cannot help but feel drawn to, they are free, alive, and sparkling with a revere that Troy has never seen before and it ignites a fire in his lower abdomen. Ryan looks completely relaxed and in his element. He is drawn out of his perusal as the music track slows, fading out as it ends, watching as Ryan strikes his finishing pose, eyes taking in his own position before they flicker with surprise as they finally take notice of the presence of the other boy behind himself. \"Hey.\" He whispers breathlessly, whether from the dancing or from the completely relaxed posture of Troy, the way his arms are crossed over his chest, a small expanse of stomach being revealed. The image is a delight. He isn\\'t quite sure, but he knows that his face is expression his utter joy at being able to see the other boy so early on in the day. \"Hey Ryan, nice moves.\" Troy gives an impish grin as he pushes himself off the doorframe, moving slowly into the room, walking closer to the other boy, hands shoved deep in his pockets as his eyes once again trail the length of Ryan\\'s body, eyes bright with appreciation as a stirring in his lower abdomen makes him feel a burning heat which sparks his nerves alight. \"Thanks, just a little something I was working on before for the talent show before…\" Ryan trails off, his eyes sad and glassy as he reminisces on the way his twin, his best friend had completely dropped him from their act in favour of the Primo boy of East High, not that he blames Troy for any of this. It is extremely hard to say no to Sharpey at the best of times, let alone when faced with the wrath of the Evans family and the expectant gazes of the U of A basketball team. \"Hey, look man. I am really sorry about that.\" Troy quickly apologises, his own face pinching in sympathy and embarrassment as he takes another, small step closer, this one more hesitant then the last, even as he ruffles Ryan\\'s hair affectionately laughing at the squeak he hears. \"No. No, there is absolutely no reason for you to apologise, Troy. None of it was your fault, none of it. I know that Sharpey blackmailed you into that promise to sing with her. It\\'s just that she is the one that has always been there for me, you know and now…\" \"I get it, man. I know the feeling, but just because Sharpey left you high and dry doesn\\'t mean that you can\\'t perform in the talent show.\" Ryan looks up, attempting to fix his hair with a playful huff as he considers Troy\\'s words carefully. His desire to be a part of the talent show, without hiding behind Sharpey\\'s overbearing stage presence to be on his own or even with someone he doesn\\'t know. To show his parents and his peers, and everyone else who has ever doubted him really, that he is more than just a loyal lapdog. To show people what he can truly do being one of his driving forces. \"Do you really think I can do it?\" Troy\\'s features soften, placing one of his warm calloused hands on the curve of Ryan\\'s cheekbone, his thumb moving back and forth affectionately as he gently tilts Ryan\\'s face up so that his eyes meet his own. He offers, what he hopes is, a soothing smile as he continues to stroke over the growing blush. \"I truly do, Ry. What I just saw, you own choreography, was amazing, breath-taking, pure brilliance even. That song was mesmerising, and I can honestly say that if the audience saw that then they are going to love you.\" Ryan leans into the touch as if he has been starved of it, closing his eyes to savour the warmth coming from the taller boy. His heart hammers in his chest when he hears Troy\\'s words, giving his new courage to go against his sister, to sing on stage and showcase that he is more than just Sharpey\\'s poodle, that he does have his own talents. \"Sharpey is going to kill me…\" He whispers with a small grin, giggling when Troy snorts with amusement at that, his thumb still slowly caressing his cheek and jaw line. \"No, she won\\'t. I am not going to let her, I promise to protect you from her wrath. You deserve this chance, to show everyone what you can do.\" Troy\\'s eyes shine with mirth, his smile soft, warm, and completely open as he steps closer to Ryan feeling the heat coming off the smaller boy\\'s boy in waves. Melding with his own. \"This song is supposed to be a duet though, I would need to find someone to sing with, someone whose voice will meld with my own. A person who can dance and sing but I… I kind of told the Wildcats that I wouldn\\'t help them with their own performance, I doubt any of them would agree to be my partner after that…\" Ryan lowers his eyes to the floor, eyebrows furrowed in concentration, ears burning with embarrassment as Troy looks down at him with befuddlement, trying to recall such an event. \"What? When?\" \"The day of the staff baseball game, Gabriella and the rest cornered me before the game starts, after finding out that Sharpey had pulled the plug on our performance. She asked if I would choreograph their number and perform with them.\" \"Why didn\\'t you?\" Troy askes, genuinely curious. Ryan takes a deep breath, leaning further into Troy\\'s hand as he brings one of his own up to press the appendix closer to his cheek, feeling his cheeks flushing as he continues to stare at the floorboards. \"I saw how quickly they turned on you Troy, they turned on you so quickly, without so much as a second thought. No thought about you were feeling and what you were going through. All because you were trying to focus on your future, one you are not even sure you want, a future which they expect you to build. Simply because you are not keeping to their expectations, their moulds and I was scared. Terrified that they would simply use me for my talents and then drop me just like Sharpey. I was angry at them for what they did to you and didn\\'t want to help them.\" Ryan trails of, falling silent after that small rant. His gaze fixated on the wooden flooring as he refuses to meet Troy\\'s gaze. He feels the older boy shifting his weight and feels the beginning of fear creeping in when he notices the hand on his cheek pulling away. He tenses, waiting for Troy to react, possibly with disgust or at the very least, confusion and disappointment, maybe. He is surprised when he instead feels a pair of strong arms wrapping around his shoulders and lower back. A comforting gesture which he finds himself melting into as he fights against tears. \"Thank you, I don\\'t really know what to say, Ry? Are you going to be all right though? The Wildcats are prone to holding long grudges and I am sorry to say that they didn\\'t much like you before but now…\" He stops not feeling the need to finish his sentence because he knows Ryan will understand what he is trying to say, that he is concerned for him. He can\\'t hide the worry, and doesn\\'t particularly want to, for the younger boy as he holds him just that bit tighter. He feels sorry for Ryan, knowing that he had been subjected to a few beatings now and again by those same jocks. \"Yea I know. I am okay with them not being my friends, I have never considered them as such anyway and I have never had many to begin with. I am just happy that I have you, right?\" He questions, feeling some of his deepest anxieties starting to rise in his chest even as he pressed closer, hoping that he truly can count on Troy to be there for him no matter what now. Especially all they had been through, what he has revealed to the other boy, over the past few days. He doesn\\'t want to lose the close companionship, or whatever it was developing between them, anytime soon; doesn\\'t want to think about what he would do if he lost Troy. \"Definitely. I care a lot for you, Ryan. I don\\'t agree with what Sharpey did to you and I apologise for whatever my ex-friends said and tried to make you feel obliged to do but you have your own opinions and feelings about what you want to do and what you think you should do. I will support you 110% with anything you decide.\" Ryan draws back from the embrace making sure to keep his hands wrapped in the material of Troy\\'s shirt, his face splitting into a wide grin as he beams up at the taller boy who returns the expression with a soft, fond smile of his own. The two stand there, in the middle of the rec room, for a brief moment basking in the warmth of the other. \"I have to ask you though, how do you manage it?\" Ryan tilts his head to the side, his eyebrows furrowing in confusion as he drags his eyes across Troy\\'s face, noticing for the first time the pale bags under his eyes, the paler than usual pallor of his skin and the sheer exhaustion shaping his features. \"Manage what?\" \"Perform with Sharpey. You make it look so easy. I swear it is like a waking nightmare with that woman, what with all those pyrotechnics threatening to singe me, the loud beats, the extravagant costumes, and dance moves. The constant touches as well.\" Ryan can\\'t help it, he feels the shudder travel through Troy\\'s body and sees the expression of horror spreading across his features, easily able to picture Sharpey trying her best to flirt with an overly uncomfortable Troy Bolton as they run through their routine. He laughs, a loud, joyous sound which not only catches the basketball player off guard but also manages to draw a small chuckle from him as well. \"It is stressful to say the least, but I am used to being pushed around by her, being stuck in the background, overlooked, to being in her shadow so I don\\'t usually get the brunt of her stage dramatics.\" Troy moans mournfully, put out by the entire experience, not really wanting to have to perform with Sharpey at all because of her overbearing stage presence, her overly dramatic sets and her flairs for perfection. He gazes down thoughtfully at Ryan, feeling an ache beginning to form in his chest, a longing. \"I wish it were you I was doing all this with instead.\" He sighs wistfully, his gaze sad as he glances down at the younger boy\\'s pale pink lips, his tongue darting out to wet his own as his eyes trace the delicate features on Ryan\\'s face. He watches with poorly veiled amusement as Ryan\\'s head shoots up, his eyes wide with wonder, the corners of his lips tugging up into a disbelieving smile. \"Really?\" Troy nods, bringing a hand from behind Ryan\\'s back to carefully stroke his cheeks again absentmindedly, an action which Ryan is quickly becoming addicted to, as he sighs deeply hating whoever it was that made Ryan doubt his self-worth so much. \"I could try to speak to my dad for you… I don\\'t think it\\'s right that your scholarship, if it is something you still want to do, is hanging in the balance simply due to the promise you were pretty much blackmailed into making anyway. If you truly wouldn\\'t mind, I would love for you to perform with me…?\" He enquires hesitantly, still feeling slightly stunned that Troy Bolton would prefer to dance and sing with himself rather than Gabriella, his sister, or the other Wildcats… He now wishes upon his wildest dreams that he will be able to convince his father, the man who is always tripping over himself to grant Sharpey\\'s, his favourite child\\'s, every wish and demand, that Troy would be better off away from Sharpey. He just needs to find a good enough excuse and get the man to actually listen to him for once. \"You\\'re serious? You would really do that for me, Ry?\" Ryan feels himself blushing with pleasure at the established nickname, at the overjoyed expression on Troy\\'s face as he smiles happily up at the other boy, not caring that he could potentially be performing; singing and dancing, with Troy in the talent show against his sister. He still doesn\\'t understand why Troy would look so excited at the prospect of dancing with the lessor of the Evans twins, but he is not counting his eggs. \"Of course, I will speak to his tomorrow.\" Troy, in his elation, picks Ryan up around the waist, pulling him tight against his chest as he spins them both around. Laughing as Ryan quickly wraps his arms around his neck as he squeals in shock at the sudden action before his laughter joins Troy\\'s. Burying his face into Ryan\\'s blond hair as he places him back onto his feet, he inhales the calming scent which he is beginning to associate with the other teen. Relaxing when Ryan curls closer, returning his embrace, his grip just as strong. \"Thank you, Ryan. I\\'ll be looking forward to our rehearsals.\" He whispers before pulling away slowly, he kisses Ryan on the cheek in his relief of not having to deal with Sharpey anymore and his excitement to finally sing with the male Evans. Turning to leave, he waves over his shoulder, his shift as a junior golf pro instructor starting in a few minutes. Ryan watches him go, his eyes involuntarily being drawn to the others tight rear end as a hand touches his cheek reverently, his face staining a dark red as the warmth in his chest explodes into a flurry of butterflies fluttering about in the cage of his ribcage. Ryan is walking through the halls of Lava Springs in the early hours of the morning, an unusual spring in his step. His mind deep in thought trying to figure out exactly how he is going to go about convincing his father that Troy is better off not performing with Sharpey. How could he get the man to listen to him long enough, to hear him out like he does with his \\'princess.\\' He is almost desperate, wanting to help Troy both with his scholarship if he decides to go for it and with discovering and navigating this new self he is finding. He is pulled from his thoughts abruptly by the sharps sounds of pots and pans being jolted, crashing against themselves followed by multiple shocked gasps all coming from the kitchen. Turning quickly on his heels feeling a deep unsettling emotion begin to form in the pit of his stomach he quickly makes his way towards the disturbance. Only to freeze, feeling his heart clenching painfully in his chest at the scene laid out before him. He sees Troy sprawled out on the tiled floor, a hand clasping tightly to his cheek, covering the beginnings of an angry red mark. His eyes are wide as they stare up in shock at his best friend and honorary brother who is standing above him, fists clenching at his sides, teeth grinding together, eyes glittering with malice and hints of regret. Ignoring the gathering crowds of their classmates and Troy\\'s ex-teammates, Ryan runs over to the injured teen, focusing solely on his new and as of right now, only true, and close friend. Placing a slightly shaking hand on the boy\\'s shoulder he offers a small sad smile, trying to reassure Troy who glances back at him with eyes filled with relief and deep hurt. \"Come on.\" He whispers into the growing silence, wrapping a protective arm around Troy\\'s lower back he slowly straightens himself out, helping the other boy to his feet steadying him when he stumbles. He offers his hand out, watching with a deep sorrow as Troy clasps it in his own as if it were a lifeline. The heart-breaking situation making Ryan want to cry for the boy next to himself. He casts a quick, nervous glance around the room, inwardly flinching at all of the glares and dispassionate faces of the surrounding Wildcats, knowingly instantly, even without Gabriella\\'s ridiculously high IQ, that none of them genuinely care for their former friend, that most of them thought Troy deserved to be punched in the face by his closest friend. Holding tight to Troy\\'s hand, both in trepidation and reassurance as he wraps his other around his bicep in a stabilising grip, steering him through the doors of the kitchen and into the dining room, where he manoeuvres the shocked teen into a seat at one of the empty tables. Watching with worry coating his features as Troy all but collapses into it with a deep sigh. Ryan drags a nervous hand through his hair, having foregone one of his usual hats that morning and stares at Troy. His earlier heartache coming back as he feels deeply sorry for the boy in from of himself as he recalls the multiple instances where he had been on the receiving end of many hateful knees, feet, hands, and fists. Knowing that it must have felt much worse for the basketball player coming from the person supposedly closest to him, who was supposed to support and care for him most of all. The latest infraction probably cementing the fact that Troy has most likely list them all completely. Taking a deep calming breath, Ryan kneels on the floor, placing a supporting hand on the other\\'s knee, his thumb absently rubbing back and forth in a soothing manner as his other grips the injured boy\\'s chin gently, forcing him to meet his steady gaze. \"What happened?\" He enquires softly, not want Troy to feel pressured into answering. His voice is apologetic and barely above a whisper not wanting to call too much attention to them from the other customers, lest it get back to his sister before he can talk to his father. Troy hears him though, his dull blue eyes turning to focus on the lighter blond-haired boy, leaning forward slightly, he lets his gaze bore into Ryan\\'s as he covers the hand on his knee with his own. \"Gabriella broke up with me last night and quit her job.\" Ryan winces, feeling guilty when a surge of hopefulness builds in his chest at the distressing news, though a strange sense of regret pools in his stomach for reasons unknown to him. Flipping his hand around slowly, in order to take Troy\\'s giving it a squeeze to show his support and compassion. Even as he tries to ignore the growing elation spreading through his veins. \"I am so sorry Troy.\" Troy sighs heavily, feeling dragging his free hand through his mussed hair as he shifts his hand so that their fingers are interlaced, both ignoring the jolt of electricity this seems to send through their arms and the tingling in their fingers. He leans back in his chair tiredly, pulling Ryan with him. He offers a small smile to the Theatre King and tugs him forward that much more, his voice whispering conspiratorially, if a little sadly as he rests his forehead upon the others shoulder. \"In all honesty, I\\'m not. I have known that we had been drifting apart for a while now, though I doubt many other would have noticed. She kept saying how I have changed, that she didn\\'t really recognise me anymore, that nothing was going how she had expected them to go this summer. She said she doesn\\'t like the person I am becoming… or have become. That I am not the guy she wants to date.\" Ryan sits in shock for a few seconds, his brain working overtime to process exactly what Gabriella had said and implied when she spoke to Troy, the boy she was supposed to love and support. His spare hand lifts to card gently through Troy\\'s hair secretly enjoying the feeling of the other boy resting in his arms, leaning on his shoulder as he offers what support and comfort he can. He knew that things had been rough for the playmaker in the past few weeks, that things were bad between Troy and Gabriella, let alone between Troy and the rest of the Wildcats, but he hadn\\'t realised how terrible things had truly gotten and it was all his sister\\'s fault. He feels his heart clenching at the simple thought of the tears Troy must have shed, despite not having as strong a feeling for the girl as he had first assumed. \"Well, I know for a fact that none of what she said is true, Troy. You are a kind-hearted guy. You go out of your way to help other people and are always willing to talk to those who others would just walk past in the halls. Despite what everyone else thinks, you are an amazing friend and from I have seen a loving boyfriend.\" Ryan calms his racing heart when he feels Troy nodding along with his words, his hair tickling the skin of his neck ever so slightly, feeling glad that the other teenagers hadn\\'t damaged Troy\\'s opinions about himself too much. He sighs inwardly when Troy leans backwards, squeezing Ryan\\'s hand in thanks before taking a deep breath. \"Apparently, when she got home, Gabriella phoned Taylor and told her everything that had happened, who then told the rest of the Wildcats this morning. Chad, it seems, finally snapped at me. He kept telling me that I was nothing but a jerk with new shoes, that I wasn\\'t the person they knew anymore and that I should just run back to the \\'Princess\\' to do her bidding, they told me I wasn\\'t wanted there anymore. None of them gave me a chance to explain my side of things, they were perfectly happy to blame it all on me.\" Troy mumbles out meaning Ryan has to lean forward to catch what he is saying. Troy feels lost now that he knows he has lost his friends completely, that even if they tried to apologise and changed their minds about everything, nothing would be the same between them and their team dynamic has shifted. He knew that he couldn\\'t trust them fully anymore, afraid that they would turn on him again. Ryan feels helpless as he watches Troy attempting to mask his emotions; to close himself off behind a wall. Standing up from his position on the floor, without losing his grip on the hand in his own he wraps an arm around Troy\\'s broad shoulders giving him a tight hug which Troy is quick to return. Tugging the smaller boy as close to himself as he can manage, making him stand between his spread knees. After a few moments, the two are bought out of their comfortable bubble by the rhythmic clicking of shoes travelling across the wooden flooring. Ryan pulls back just enough to see Kelsi, Composer of the Winter Musical, and fellow musician, making her way towards them, features a mask of sympathy as she carries what seems to be a washcloth filled with ice in her hands. She wordlessly offers it to the two boys, surprised when Ryan takes it from her before placing it on the bright red blotch on Troy\\'s face with care. With a muttered thank you, Kelsi nods in acknowledgement, offering a sad smile to the injured teen before her eyes widen a fraction as she takes in the strangely intimate position the boys are standing in. Ryan, still standing between Troy\\'s legs is pressing the cold cloth against the other boy\\'s cheek, their hands intertwined on Troy\\'s thigh as his other hand is wrapped around Ryan\\'s waist keeping the smaller boy close. \"I\\'m sorry.\" She hears Ryan whisper, his voice smaller and more timid than she had ever heard it before, she watches as his gaze flickers down towards their interlaced fingers, his thumb brushing against the stark white bandage covering Troy\\'s knuckles as a tightness expands through his chest. Her eyes soften into a fond expression as she sees Troy slowly, gently grip Ryan\\'s chin, tilting his face down so that their eyes lock, a soft smile on his lips. \"No – he begins firmly – None of this has been your fault Ry. It was Sharpey\\'s, I know she planned for all this to happen that she is the reason behind everything, my promotion, the scholarship, me missing my dates and staff events. You didn\\'t make my friends turn their backs on me. You didn\\'t make Gabriella break up with me. You didn\\'t make me rehears with Sharpey. You are a good person, Ry. A great person. Someone who has been there for me the most these past few days.\" Kelsi, realising that her presence is no longer required, or needed and feeling much like an intruder in what seems to be a very private and loving moment, decides to quietly make her way back into the kitchens. Though not before seeing Ryan all but throwing himself into Troy\\'s arms, both of his arms going around the older boy\\'s neck as he whispers reverently, \\'thank you\\' repeatedly as Troy merely chuckles and holds onto him just as tightly. She disappears, her thoughts a chaotic mess, pondering on the developing relationship between Ryan and Troy. Troy, on the other hand, sits happily with Ryan tucked into his neck, the smaller boy practically sitting on his lap now as he presses himself joyfully into Troy\\'s welcoming embrace. He feels his heart starting to hammer violently in his chest, the blood rushing through his veins as it pounds in his ears as a warmth spreads through his entire being as he drags a hand through the light blond strands. \"You know, before I heard the commotion in the kitchens, I was on my way to speak to my father about you performing with me instead of Sharpey…\" Ryan says suggestively, after calming himself down, though ha makes no move to retract himself from the basketball players lap, his head still resting comfortably against the broad shoulder, relishing in the feel of strong arms wrapping around his waist, a large hand covering his knee. Troy looks down at the content choreographer, tightening his grip around the other\\'s waist before he pulls back, offering a blinding smile to Ryan as he carefully stands the other boy up, discarding the icepack on the table as he steadies Ryan as he wobbles slightly. He holds out a hand to the smaller boy, delighting in the blush which dusts the other\\'s cheeks on he slips his hand into the outstretched one. \"Well, what are we waiting for then? Let\\'s find your dad!\" He replies with excitement, proceeding to drag a non-resisting Ryan out of the dining area despite not knowing where to find the older Evans. Ryan laughs softly at Troy\\'s obvious relief at getting away from Sharpey and her rehearsals and at his joy at getting to sing with her twin instead. He rolls his eyes good naturedly as they make their way outside taking up the role of guild as he leads Troy towards the golfing green where he knows that his dad would most likely be. Practicing his stance and swing as he is prone to do in the early hours of the morning. They quickly spot the older Evans just as they step onto the green, he has a club in hand, a small white golf ball at the ready as he begins to line up his shot with practiced ease. Not noticing the two approaching teens until his son\\'s nervous voice breaks his concentration. \"Dad?\" \"Hmmm?\" The man hums in acknowledgement, not taking his eyes from the ball on the ground by his feet. \"Dad… Performing with Sharpey isn\\'t really working out that well for Troy…\" He states as calmly as possible, knowing that he is better off stating the truth in as blunt a way in order to ensure his father\\'s attention. Ryan can feel Troy\\'s tension through their joined hands and smiles calmly up at his friend before focusing on his dad, frowning when he sees the man\\'s focus still on the small ball. He bites the inside of his cheek. \"I have heard that is has been going better than expected.\" He answers in a noncommittal tone, proving to Ryan that he isn\\'t paying him much mind as he feels the resentment for his father growing in the pit of his stomach. If he were Sharpey, Vance Evans would already be scrambling to placate her. \"Yea that\\'s because you don\\'t care about anything but your perfect little Princess.\" Troy is surprised by the amount of bitterness he can hear in Ryan\\'s mutterings, it only loud enough for the other to hear it. Louder he says. \"He already has a job at the resort, his commitments to the RedHawks and these rehearsals to focus on dad, it is a lot of pressure to put on a lone person\\'s shoulders and you know Sharpey isn\\'t the most accommodating person to work with. He has already been unable to attend half of the staff activities because of it.\" Ryan can tell his voice is rising with frustration, trying once more to gain his father\\'s attention instead of being ignore for a small insignificant ball, huffing quietly when the man simply hums, swinging his club in a practicing arc before readjusting his stance. \"Multitasking and hard-work will look great on a college application son, Troy is simply looking out for his future. They will see how he has managed his time and how well he has coped with all of his commitments.\" \"By running himself into the ground?!\" Ryan shouts, his resentment, offense at the man\\'s audacity to still not look at him, frustration at being brushed off once more break through. \"Sharpey made his girlfriend break up with him and quit her job simply because she couldn\\'t keep her grabby hands to herself despite being told no on multiple occasions. She has been pushing him too hard, not giving a damn about his thoughts and opinions, not considering his little experience with full effects when performing. She has turned all of his friends against him and he has been fighting on his own being scorned everywhere he goes. Do you even care for nothing but yourself and your precious Princess?\" Ryan continues to shout at the man, his face red with anger as he lets go of his remaining restraint letting his resentment for the man before him to control his tone, his volume, and his posture. He inwardly scoffs when the man turns surprised eyes towards him finally, standing straight when he notices the teenager boy standing happily next to his son, who is scowling at him. Hatred burning in his eyes. \"I know Princess has a tough time accepting no as an answer.\" Mr Evans muses to himself, taking a cautionary step closer towards the boys, his eyes drifting across Troy\\'s body taking a closer look at the other boy. He frowns thoughtfully when he sees the beginnings of a nasty bruise forming on his right cheek, the light black smudges under his eyes, the tight pull of his skin around his face and the bandage wrapped around his knuckles. The boy looks downtrodden, exhausted, weary, and just down right fed up as he grips his son\\'s hand tightly, the contact seemingly being the only thing holding the teen upright. \"Dad, we have footage from all of the East High Musicals and you have seen Troy play isn\\'t that enough to try and sway the board into a scholarship deal, if Troy still wants to do it. I don\\'t like seeing him this tired…\" Mr Evans turns his gaze towards Ryan\\'s pleading and angry eyes, knowing that it was his own fault that his son resented him so much. He had spent so much time giving his full attention to Sharpey giving in to her every demand no matter the consequence, even if it had a negative impact on his other child. Guilt wells up when he thinks about all of the attention he should have given Ryan, how he should have listened to him more, looked after him and supported him. He looks between Ryan and Troy, sighing deeply with regret as he spies the starts of something big developing between the two teenagers, especially as he watches Ryan squeeze the hand holding his own. He watches as the small gestures makes some of the tension leak from the taller boy\\'s frame. He knows that he doesn\\'t really have the right to ask his son about any of it and even if he did, he wouldn\\'t blame Ryan if his questions went unanswered. He knows he has a lot to make up for, but he makes a silent vow to himself to support Ryan in all his decisions in the future. \"Alright, I suppose you are right, Ryan. I will talk to the board tomorrow for you, but what do you suppose we do about the talent show? The are some distinguished representatives coming to watch Troy perform and I will not let them down.\" He looks on as Ryan exchanges a quick glance with Troy, them seemingly having a short conversation with their eyes and facial expressions before they turn back to him as one, eyes determined and focused. It is Troy who speaks. \"We were hoping, Mr Evans, the you wouldn\\'t mind if I performed with Ryan instead. Not only is he a brilliant choreographer and director but I find him much easier to dance with and he has been there for me recently and makes me feel comfortable. I would still be performing with an Evans…\" Mr Evans flicks his gaze to his son, feeling amusement replace the guilt in his chest as he sees the light pink blush dusting his pale cheeks, his smile bright as Troy says those words making him smile fondly at the teenagers, glad that Ryan has found someone to take care of him. \"I guess I can accept that, it would make for a better performance if you were completely comfortable Mr Bolton but what of your sister, Ryan?\" Ryan shrugs uncaringly at the question of his sister\\'s own performance his eyes holding a steel and deep hurt. Vance can tell that his son is still feeling betrayed and bitter after being hung to dry by his twin at the start of the summer and in all honesty, he can\\'t blame him. \"After the way she has treated not only myself but Troy this summer, I don\\'t, particularly care. I am sure you or Mr Fulton can come up with something to appease her.\" It doesn\\'t stop him from frowning in disapproval at Ryan\\'s flippant attitude though, but as he thinks back to the look on his son\\'s face and how depressed Ryan had been the following few days when Sharpey pulled the rug out from under him, replacing him with Troy, he can understand and doesn\\'t say a word against any of it. \"I am sure, Mr Fulton or myself can find a suitable partner for Princess by the time the talent show comes around, possibly one of the theatre kids from U of A. I am sure she will be fine with that.\" Ryan nods, feeling relief at the fact that his sister is not going to be left floundering, no matter what he initially feels about her at the present time. Feeling grateful that his father actually listened to him for once he smiles brightly at Troy before tugging the other boy around, so they can head back to the building and talk. Troy and Ryan are sitting on Ryan\\'s bed discussing the different dance moves, settings and costumes they could have for their upcoming performance at the talent show. They had agreed to sing the song which Ryan had written, not that Troy gave him much of a choice in the matter. Though he was amused to note that when he had asked Ryan who he had written that love song for he had flushed a bright red and stuttered terribly. He couldn\\'t help feeling a bit jealous at the thought of Ryan crushing on someone else. The song, which Ryan had written and composed with Kelsi\\'s help, the one Troy had caught him dancing to earlier that morning is called \\'Everyday\\' and Troy is incredibly glad that he would be performing it as a duet with the smaller teen. Feeling content with the progress of the day, despite the dull aching in his cheek, Troy lies back against Ryan\\'s pillows pulling the other teen with him. He delights inwardly at the feeling of Ryan\\'s warm body pressing into his side as he curls an arm around him in a one-armed hug. Cushioning his head on top his other arm, Troy feels content with the weight of Ryan\\'s head against his shoulder, never having felt quite like he is at the moment with anyone else. Ryan, feeling just as relaxed, cuddles closer to Troy, his head nuzzling into the junction between Troy\\'s neck and shoulder as he slips one of his arms across the other\\'s strong, toned chest curling onto his side as he snuggles as close as he can to his friend. Happy to just waste the rest of the day locked in his room doing nothing but talk to Troy as they plan the rest of their performance, get to know each other a little better and discuss what they are going to do about the escalating hostility with the rest of the Wildcats. \"We could just avoid them for the rest of the summer…\" Ryan suggest timidly, knowing that because of his earlier actions of helping Troy after he had told his classmates, quite firmly, that he will not be assisting them with their own act in the talent show, their dislike for him would have increased and he was not in any hurry to see them again. Terrified that he is going to be targeted by some of the more aggressive players once again if they ever find him alone around the club. \"You know we can\\'t do that Ry, they work here and so do I.\" Troy says softly, tightening his arm around Ryan\\'s shoulders when he feels the smaller boy curl into his side tighter, one of his thin dance-toned legs slipping over his own to allow the movement. \"I promise that I am going to do by best to protect you as much as I can Ryan, they won\\'t hurt you when I am around and if they try I will keep them away from you. Though I doubt they will risk getting fired just to injure your pretty face.\" Ryan blushes darkly at those words, never having been called pretty before. Hiding his face in Troy\\'s shoulder as the other boy laughs at his reaction, a hand brushing through his hair. Troy leans up, so he is resting on his elbow, forcing Ryan to lie flat on his back against the multiple pillows he has decorating his bed. His blue eyes staring happily down into the wide gaze of the smaller boy. He slowly brings his free hand around to cup Ryan\\'s cheek, his thumb brushing the dark red blush which starts to spread down his neck. Smiling softly at the happy spark shining in the other\\'s eyes. Troy\\'s eyes flicker to Ryan\\'s full lips, his tongue darting out to wet his own suddenly dry ones as he swallows nervously, switching his eyes up to meet Ryan\\'s once more catching a sharp glint in Ryan\\'s gaze before he slowly leans forward. His gaze moving cautiously between the rose-pink lips and sky-blue eyes as he tests the others reaction to his movements. Ryan feels his heart skip a beat in his chest when Troy\\'s intentions become clear to him, he lies in anticipation as Troy begins to lean forward, the taller boy now resting on his side, propped up on his elbow, one leg hooked over Ryan\\'s own as his hand continues to caress his cheek lovingly. He feels his blood pumping faster through his veins, his palms beginning to sweat lightly as he squirms in longing. Having enough of the other boy\\'s slow movement, Ryan can barely comprehend when he grips the collar of Troy\\'s polo shirt, tugging him down so that their lips finally meet in a soft, hesitant kiss. It is barely a brush of lips, a sweet chaste first kiss, on to test the waters making Ryan\\'s blood sing and Troy to sigh happily. Allowing the taller boy to pull back a few centimetres, Ryan feels his breath catch in his throat when he sees the affection burning deep within the mesmerising ocean-blue eyes staring straight into his own. An expression he has been wanting and waiting to see on Troy\\'s face since he had first laid eyes on the other blond. He smiles happily up at Troy, wrapping his arms around his neck when Troy leans down for another sweat kiss, this one lasting longer than the previous one. Their lips move together gently, fitting together as if they were made for this, massaging at just the right pressure to make Ryan\\'s lips tingle pleasantly, blood rushing to them as sparks fly across his skin. Heat pooling his stomach as he feels the soft caress on his cheek turn to a firm hold, the fingers brushing through the hair near his ear as they slide through. Tangling in the short strands at the back of his head, angling his face up, tilting his lips allowing Troy to deepen to kiss slightly, a harder press of lips before he is pulling back. \"Wow.\" Ryan murmurs breathlessly, his face flushed with elation, hands dragging through and tugging lightly at the hair at the nap of Troy\\'s neck as he chuckles softly. Feeling like a giddy school girl as Troy\\'s own laughter joins his own, his eyes continuing to gaze down at the drama loving teen. \"I have been wanting to do that for a while now.\" Troy confesses, his lips pulling up into such a loving smile that Ryan can feel the beginnings of tears gathering in the corners of his eyes, his chest swelling with affection and a deep longing for the boy above him as he pulls him down into a tight embrace. \"I have been wanting you to do that for a while now as well.\" He answers, his voice cracking with the weight of emotions he is feeling, his throat constricting as he feels Troy\\'s arms wrap around his waist in response. The bodies moulding together perfectly in Ryan\\'s opinion. They stay like that, wrapped in each other arms for a few moments, before Troy rolls back onto his back, allowing Ryan to cuddle into his side again with a contented sigh. His leg draping across Troy\\'s one arm trapped under the small of Troy\\'s back while the other wraps around his stomach, fingers brushing his hip bone. Head resting on his broad shoulder. Cuddling closer when he feels a warm hand carding through his hair, another brushing p and down his arm in a gentle caress as a light kiss is dropped on his head. Troy is practically skipping into work the next morning, a wide smile stretching across his face as he clocks in, even thought he knows he technically doesn\\'t have to anymore. He skirts around the kitchen happily humming Ryan\\'s song under his breath as he retrieves his breakfast from Zeke and Jason, ignoring their bitter glares. \"Good morning, fellas.\" He chirps as he brushes past Chad, his humming now turning into soft, low singing as he dances across the room, sitting down at one of the benches across from Kelsi, the lyrics causing a warmth to settle into his chest as he eats between words. Having managed to get Ryan to confess that the song was written with himself in the writer\\'s thoughts. Once again not noticing the suspicious nor the surprised looks of his fellow Wildcats as they continue to stand around the kitchen either staring at him or exchanging glances between themselves. Each one trying to figure out if they knew of anything happening in the last 24 hours which could be the cause of their friend\\'s weird actions. Chad winces inwardly when he catches sight of the dark purple and blue, yellow and green bruise marring the suntanned skin of his brother in all but blood\\'s cheeks, feeling guilty at being the one to put it there without hearing Troy\\'s explanation, having spent most of his evening yesterday going over the events of the day. Kelsi smiles happily when Troy greats her, her eyes sparkling with mischief when she hears the lyrics he is singing, recognising some of the dance moves he was practicing around the kitchen floor as he now sits at the table. She finds it amusing to see Troy looking so happy and carefree, more so than he has been all summer, when he is surrounded by a group of people who have been shunning him since day one. Knowing that it is all because of a certain blond male. \"Yo, Hoops!\" Troy stops his singing, his movements all but freezing as he turns around to face Chad, the happy smile on his face dropping as his eyes turn icy and blank, his expression equally as so. Not giving away any of his thoughts. The action causes Chad to flinch, knowing full well that it is all his fault that the younger teen is reacting this way. He offers a small awkward smile, wiping his suddenly sweaty hands down his white apron as he picks up his own breakfast, bringing it over to sit next to Kelsi, opposite Troy. \"What\\'s got you in such a good mood, rehearsals with the Ice queen going that well?\" \"Nothing much.\" He answers simply, his mind wondering as he once more begins to hum the tune to his and Ryan\\'s song under his breath, not seemingly able to stop as a wistful smile comes to his lips, letting out a happy sigh. \"You sure? You seem a little spacey this morning.\" \"Hmmm?\" Troy hums in response, knowing that Chad is trying to mend the bridge between them but without an apology to both himself and Ryan he is not exactly going to make it easy on the other teen, especially when Chad won\\'t admit he had been wrong. He continues to eat his food while singing the chorus once more, his body swaying from side to side as he meets Kelsi\\'s knowing gaze. He winks in response to the girl making her giggle. \"I\\'m fine, Danforth. Just trying to remember my routine for the Talent show is all.\" He responds absentmindedly, his smile returning, his eyes sparkling with a happiness which Chad admits he hasn\\'t seen in the past few weeks and feeling his curiosity peaking wanting to know what has happened to put the light back in his brother\\'s eyes like that. Troy quickly clears his plate, standing up to move over to the sink so he can wash it up just as Ryan Evans walks into the kitchen he too offering a wide smile to the Wildcats in his sight only serving to confuse them more. \"Good morning, Wildcats.\" He calls, moving over to stand next to Troy who smiles brightly down at the smaller male. Ryan snickers under his breath when he hears the older boy still humming their song under his breath, having only given Troy the music sheet last night as he was preparing to go home. Though he is pleased to see Troy looking so excited about their approaching performance. \"Yo, Evans. DO you know what\\'s up with Troy?\" Ryan turns to look at Zeke, the tall boy flipping an omelette in his frying pan as he stares at Troy, eyebrows furrowing in confusion, looking as if he were trying to figure out a rather complicated puzzle. Turning to look back at Troy, Ryan allows his eyes to trail slowly up and down the boy\\'s body before shaking his head, facing Zeke again. \"I don\\'t see anything wrong with Troy, why has something happened?\" Troy snorts quietly making Ryan to look at him from the corner of his eyes, his lips twitching into a smirk before his expression turns concerned. After much discussion last night, they had both decided to act as friendly as possible with the Wildcats, not telling them about the sudden switch in partners for the talent show. For the main reason of keeping their newly established, budding relationship a secret for as long as possible. For two, they want to see the looks on their faces when they realise not only the two of the performing together but singing a love song with each other. It is sure to be a memorable night. \"Hey Kels?\" Troy shouts out of nowhere, once he is drying up his plate. The girl looks up from her sheets of music her eyes holding a silent question as she raises a single eyebrow at Troy. \"How are the preparations going for the staff performance? I heard from a little bird that the song is going to be awesome?\" He states happily, chuckling at the pale blush painted across Ryan\\'s cheeks at being called a small bird, Ryan huffs lightly and nudges Troy with his shoulder both chuckling into their hands as they ignore the shocked looks from around the room at their interactions. \"It\\'s going really well; the song is all finished, and I am hoping to get some rehearsal time in this afternoon, so I can give everyone their parts. We need to work on the dances and such, but it should be good when it is all put together. How is yours going?\" Troy beams at her, knowing that she was the one who helped Ryan work on the song for them to sing together, though she didn\\'t expect them to be able to practice and perform it so soon, let alone at all what with Troy being with Gabriella before and not showing much interest in Ryan. \"It is going great; the dance lessons are definitely interesting, and I have pretty much all the lyrics pat down. My partner is helping me a lot with understanding the kind of stage presence I am going to need for this particular song and our outfits are chosen.\" \"That\\'s good to hear, I hope you have fun and enjoy yourself.\" \"Oh, I will.\" It at this point that their conversation is interrupted by someone clearing their throat. Taylor makes her way across the room her eyes narrowed as she stares hard at the interaction between Troy and Kelsi. She sends a subtle wink towards Chad who nods his head with a grin, both Ryan and Troy catching the interaction and instantly being put on guard. Knowing that the two had something planned for the, this morning. Troy can feel his muscles tensing up as he watches the girl\\'s progression, shifting ever so slightly so that he is standing protectively in front of Ryan who glances between his boyfriend and Taylor with concern. \"Hey Troy. – she begins – I was wondering… why don\\'t you ditch Sharpey and come back to performing with us, I am sure you would have more fun with your friends.\" She almost demands, leaning casually against the counter in front of him, as Jason, Zeke, Chad and Martha all join her, their arms crossing in front of their chests trying to look intimidating, even with the easy smile on their faces. Troy shifts his weight again, feeling the tension bleed out of his form when he feels Ryan\\'s nimble fingers slipping under his shirt, brushing against his lower back in a comforting manner, before they curl into the material of his shirt. Silently supporting him as he faces the ever existent expecting gazes of his past friends. He tucks his hands into the pockets of his cargo trousers, looking over his shoulder quickly at Ryan, he offers a sly wink before facing the others. \"You know what Taylor, that sounds like a really nice idea.\" He begins, trying hard to repress his smirk as he watches the self-satisfied smile making its way to her face. \"But I am going to have to decline. I don\\'t know why you would think I would find it fun to perform with the group of people who have ignored me, blamed me for everything which has gone wrong this summer, for Gabriella leaving and breaking up with me, for my promotion. Who have shunned me for trying to secure a better future for myself. As far as I am concerned you haven\\'t been my friends since I was blackmailed into performing with Sharpey.\" Kelsi allows herself to smirk in satisfaction at the slight dressing down her fellow classmates are receiving from Troy, herself always silently supporting the older teen which he knows and appreciated. She gives a firm nod to Troy and Ryan showing her continuing support for the couple before she exits the kitchen to set up the piano in the dining room. Troy cocks his hip to the side, making himself comfortable as he leans against the sink as Ryan jumps up to sit on the counter top beside him, hand still brushing against his lower back, their position obscuring the action from view. They both stare down at the gobsmacked expressions on their ex-friends and teammates faces. A wicked sense of satisfaction curling deep in their chests as it seems to finally dawn on the group just what they had done to one of their own through these past summer weeks. Chad looks over at Troy sadly, his brother and best friend wouldn\\'t even look at him now, and he feels terrible, allowing his jealousy and anger to get the better of him. \"Look, Troy, Mate. I am sorry for everything that I have said and done to you this summer, I really am. I shouldn\\'t have tried to get in the way of your scholarship, I was just jealous that you were getting the opportunity to play with the RedHawks. Can you forgive me?\" Troy flicks his gaze to Chad fleetingly, his blue eyes void of their usual cheer as he stares into the other guilt-ridden brown orbs. He sighs deeply, dragging a hand through his hair in thought. \"I really don\\'t know, Chad. You were the one person who is always supposed to have my back no matter what, you are the one who is supposed to trust me and believe in me, but you didn\\'t. At the first sign of trouble, the first sign that I was not conforming to everyone\\'s expectations of me you turned your back on me, you mistrusted me, didn\\'t believe me. You never even gave me a chance to explain my side of things to you. Not for the baseball game, not for the two-on-two and not for when Gabriella broke up with me. You blamed everything on me, you all did, without so much as a second thought. Without the entire story.\" He sweeps his tired gaze around the room, leaning further back into the counter top, pressing Ryan\\'s hand closer, the warm fingers massaging the muscles in his lower back soothingly as he sighs once more. The two watch as each and every person shifts their gaze away from his own, their features guilty as they all start to shift self-consciously under his steely gaze. He takes a deep calming breath when Ryan\\'s fingers brush above the waistline of his trousers. It is Taylor who breaks the mounting silence first, her eyes sorrowful and confused. \"But Gabriella told me that you would deliberately miss all of your dates, you would stand her up if you weren\\'t turning up over an hour late. She said you wouldn\\'t even talk to her in the end and ignored her whenever she tried to talk to you.\" She mumbles quietly, voice rising in frustration at not being able to grasp and understand the situation in front of herself. \"The only time I turned up an hour late was when I had dinner with the Evans\\' and the RedHawks from U of A, I tried multiple times to leave early, to excuse myself from the table but they were relentless, never letting me get a word in edgewise. No matter that Sharpey was hanging off my arm like a bleeding leech.\" Ryan nods his head solemnly, his stomach twisting with jealousy as he remembers the way his sister had flirted with Troy all night, had tried to gain his attention throughout the whole meal, the thought of Troy returning her flirts, giving her the attention, she craved makes him feel sick. He feels his lips quirk into a small vindictive smile as he recalls Troy\\'s continuous disregards of her advances. \"I missed the lunch date we planned because I was at the gym on the University of Albuquerque campus and it took me too long to drive back from the game, I tried to tell them that I had to get back because I had plans but they kept running new games and playing it back. Did she tell you how I would send her a paragraph long message explaining myself and apologising for my lateness every time it happened? Did she tell you how I would send her gifts and flowers as an apology every day? Did she tell you how I found her behind the pools waterfall with Havier, the lifeguard?\" Troy asks, his voice angry and disappointed at their shocked expressions, clearly, they were just realising how much of the story they were missing and didn\\'t have the decency to ask about. Chad is looking horrified, his mind linking together all the evidence he is being given as he swipes his hand down his face. Taylor is looking angry, but Troy knows that she isn\\'t mad at himself, he suspects that Gabriella is going to be receiving a phone call at the end of the girl\\'s shift. \"You want to know the worse of it? It wasn\\'t how quickly you turned your backs on me, not even half of the stuff you said or even did to me. It is the fact that you have the audacity to stand in front of me and expect me to forgive you instantly after you spew a half-assed apology. You expect me to fall straight back into the role you all expect me to be. But that\\'s not me anymore guys, you were right when you told me that I have changed. I have spent the past few days thinking on my future and where I want it to go, finally I have decided that I am going to quit the basketball team. I am going to spend more time with the people who care about me, working on my acting, singing, and dancing because that is what I want to do.\" Troy stands to his full height, leaving his friends and teammates to stare at him with a multitude of expression on their face, ranging from horror to shock, guilt to realisation. Head held high, he walks out of the kitchen without a backwards glance, leaving his old friends behind as he makes his way through the halls of Lava Springs. He slows down his strides when he feels a small soft hand slipping into his own, fingers interlocking his face softening as he gazes down into the concerned face of his boyfriend, pausing long enough to press a soft, loving kiss to the other\\'s warm lips. Pulling a happy sigh from Ryan. The couple continue to walk through the corridors, towards one of the many practice rooms, Fulton having informed them both that they had the morning off in order to work on their routine and to perfect their performance. The talent show coming up in the next week. He had made sure to assure them that Sharpey is quite happy with her partner, not being informed as to who \\'stole\\' Troy from her. Well not being told that he is still planning to perform at all, so they can be left alone. Today is the day. After spending hours upon hours rehearsing and perfecting their routine, it is finally the big day they were both equally excited for and dreading. Troy is standing backstage, continuously brushing invisible creases out of his outfit wringing his hands into the fabric before sighing and dragging a hand through his hair, only to repeat the process again. Butterflies flutter in his stomach as he hears the beginning of Sharpey\\'s number her strong, soprano voice filling the field as she sings out the newest version of \\'Music in Me\\' with one of the Performing Arts students from U of A. \"Hey.\" Jumping in surprise, Troy spins around to find Ryan leaning against the door to his dressing room arms folded across his chest, an easy going smile on his lips as his eyes drag down the length of Troy\\'s body. Taking in the visage in front of himself, loving the way the pure white suit contrasts with the sun-tanned skin and how the pale blue dress shirt brings out the colour of Troy\\'s eyes making them even more mesmerising. \"Hey Ry.\" Ryan pushes himself off the door frame, his hands falling limply at his sides as he slowly makes his way across the room, fingers interlocking with his boyfriend\\'s as he stops a few inches in front of the taller boy. He gives the appendixes a quick reassuring squeeze, eyes sparkling with happiness when Troy places a sweet kiss to his head. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Nervous, excited, terrified…\" Troy grumbles pulling a quiet laugh from Ryan, the sound spreading a warmth through Troy\\'s chest as he watches the corners of Ryan\\'s eyes crinkles, his cheeks flushing. \"You are going to be perfect out there Troy. As soon as we start you will forget about everything else.\" \"I know and its all because of you, Ry. Your song, your choreography, your ideas and the guts you had to finally take something for yourself, to showcase what you are capable of to everyone who has ever doubted you.\" Ryan blushes, blood rushing to his cheeks as he looks down at their conjoined hands suddenly feeling shy at seeing such a heavy, adoring gaze being directed towards himself. He feels himself being pulled closer to the heated body in front of himself, his arms automatically shifting, fingertips dragging across Troy\\'s chest before they rest behind his head. He feels arms slipping around his waist, tilting his face up in acceptance. He sighs happily when soft, dry lips press gently to his own, caressing along his mouth with slow, practiced ease as he all but melts into the embrace, arms tightening around his waist. Ryan, in response, tightens his own arms around Troy\\'s neck, pulling himself closer to the firm chest feeling their bodies being separated by the thin layer of clothing exciting him. He gasps breathlessly when he feels something warm and wet brushing against the seem of his lips begging for entrance which he gladly gives. Troy\\'s tongue brushes lovingly against Ryan\\'s enticing the muscle into an intimate dance known only to the two of them. Their breathing picks up speed as Troy\\'s hands begin to lightly caress the heated skin beneath Ryan\\'s shirt, finger tips gently massaging the dimples he knows to be there in his partner\\'s lower back. They pull back, foreheads pressing against each other as their eyes remain close, neither one having any clue as to when they slipped closed. The two stand there, in their close embrace panting lightly, their bodies burning with desire which is slowly increasing as the seconds tick past. Ryan shifts his stance slightly, his face moving so it is tucked into the junction of Troy\\'s neck and shoulder breathing in the scent of Troy he has quickly become accustomed to. The two only move apart when the director of the show comes in, clearing his throat he gains the couples attention, his smile warm and accepting as he looks between them before glancing down at his clipboard. \"Mr Bolton, Mr Evans. You are on in a minute.\" \"Thank you, Xavier. We will be out in just a moment.\" Nodding in understanding, Xavier leaves the couple alone once more. Ryan looks back up into Troy\\'s ocean-blue eyes, his smile stretching as he reaches up to place a sweet chaste kiss to the other teen\\'s lips before reluctantly untangling himself from his boyfriend. He smoothes out his outfit, watching as Troy quickly follows suit making themselves presentable once again. \"Alright, it\\'s showtime.\" Troy laughs, his feet shuffling nervously as he gazes towards the curtains, the sounds of vigorous applause drifting through signalling that Sharpey and her co-star had just finished their performance. He takes a deep breath trying to sooth his hay-wiring nerves. \"You are going to be great, Troy. Just take a deep breath and relax, you can do this, and I will be right on stage next to you the entire time.\" Ryan whispers, squeezing Troy\\'s hand once more before he flitters off, going to his place, hidden amongst the crowd waiting for his cue to reveal himself. Troy watches him go, his nerves quickly turning into excitement when Ryan turns his head to wink at him before he disappears from sight. Troy, taking another deep breath, walks towards the side of the stage, happy to see Kelsi already sitting behind the piano, her face relaxed and open as he smiles at him, gesturing for him to stand in front of the instrument as his name is introduced. His eyes travel around the room, taking in the table where his parents are sitting with the Evans\\', the representatives from the University of Albuquerque sitting just off to their left. He spots the Wildcats all standing to the back of the hall, their expressions confused as to why he was not performing with Sharpey. Spotting the blonde diva, Troy holds back a wince at her murderous glare, not having realised that he was still planning to perform. Clearing his throat, Troy gives an almost unnoticeable nod towards Kelsi who instantly begins to play the first notes of his and Ryan\\'s song. Once in a lifetime Means there\\'s no second chance So I believe that you and me Should grab it while we can. His voice, soft yet strong, travels around the room, confidence growing with each word, each beat of the song when a familiar and enticing tenor-alto voice drifts through, answering his words with some of their own. Make it last forever And never give it back It\\'s our turn, and I\\'m loving where we\\'re at. Smiling widely, Troy watches in wonderment as Ryan makes his way through the crowd, easily navigating through the cluster of tables as he walks towards his boyfriend, eyes sparkling with joy as they gaze at each other. Their voices mixing perfectly with the next line. Because this moment\\'s really all we have. The couple stare into each other\\'s eyes, their focus on nothing but each other as Troy pushes himself away from the piano, his feet drawing him slowly towards the edge of the stage as Ryan continues to walk towards him, his voice gaining strength. Every day, of our lives Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gotta run, while we\\'re young And keep the faith. Troy watches mesmerised as Ryan receives a pat on the back when he walks past his father\\'s table his feet drawing him that much closer to Troy. The two being so engrossed in each other don\\'t notice the shocked looks of the junior staff members, their muttered questioning going unheard by the couple. They don\\'t see the furious glare coming from Sharpey as she crosses her arms over her chest, stomping her foot childishly. Every day, from right now Gonna use our voices to scream outloud Take my hand Together we will celebrate ( Celebrate ) Oh, Every day. Troy holds his hand out as Ryan finally makes it to the edge of the stage, helping the younger teen to climb the stairs and join him. They stand their together, side by side, hands intertwined as they gaze out at the crowd, their hearts beating with adrenaline as they register the looks they are receiving from their school mates. They say that you should follow And chase down what you dream But if you get lost and lose yourself What does that even mean? Ryan wants to laugh when Troy turns in the spot, his hand bringing one side of his blazer out flicking it sassily as he smirks at Ryan. They travel around the stage, their steps, and movements all elegant and light as they lose themselves in the moment, just like they had allowed themselves to do whilst rehearsing. Oh, no matter where we\\'re going Ooh yeah, it starts from where we are There\\'s more to life when we listen to our hearts And because of you, I\\'ve got the strength to start Yeah, yeah, yeah. Troy slides up behind Ryan, his arm wrapping around the other teen\\'s thin waist pulling him close to his chest as he sways them back and forth, their eyes closing as they absorb the heat and love they feel radiating from their partner. Every day of our lives Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gotta run, while we\\'re young And keep the faith Oh, every day, from right now Gonna use our voices to scream out loud Take my hand; Together we Will celebrate The pair can vaguely hear the sounds of loud cheering coming from the back of the room as Troy leans down to kiss Ryan on the cheek before spinning his boyfriend out and back into his arms making sure to keep his hand intertwined with the smaller\\'s. Moving across the stage the two stand on either side of Kelsi, who is now standing up, fingers flying across the keys as the two boy\\'s wrap their joined hands around her shoulders. Oh, every day We\\'re taking it back We\\'re doing it here together! It\\'d better like that And stronger now than ever! We\\'re not gonna lose Cause we get to choose That\\'s how it\\'s gonna be. The music calms down, the tempo slowing as they make their way back to the middle of the stage, Troy wrapping his arm around Ryan\\'s waist turning the younger teen around so that they are facing each other. Ryan\\'s free hand being wrapped around Troy\\'s neck, fingers curling into the short hairs at the base. Every day of our lives Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gotta run while we\\'re young And keep the faith Keep the faith! Every day of our lives Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight Gonna run while we\\'re young And keep the faith Every day from right now Gonna use our voices and scream out loud Take my hand; Together we will celebrate Everyday! The song fades to a halt, their voices drifting off as they stare into each other\\'s eyes, the stunned silence something that doesn\\'t register. They lean closer together, their lips a hair breadth apart until they finally draw forward, their lips meeting in a soft tender kiss. Cheering erupts from the stunned crowd, drawing the couple apart with a laugh. Ryan turns to see his mother and father both on their feet clapping loudly, his father whistling his approval for his performance making him beam brightly, curling one arm around Troy\\'s waist, his other resting on his firm chest. Troy glances over at his own parents, seeing them clapping just as wildly as the Evans couple he blushes lightly, his lips pulling into a wide grin as he tugs Ryan closer to his side, his arm wrapping around the smaller boy\\'s shoulder as he places a loving kiss to his head. Mr Fulton comes on stage then, his face relaxed for the first time this summer as he carries with him, the bright pink and gold starred trophy, Sharpey and the rest of the acts following him as they all gather onto the stage. They patiently, or not so patiently in Sharpey\\'s case, for the judges to vote for their favourite act before Mr Fulton clears his throat. Opening up the envelop he smiles brightly, his mouth opening as Sharpey, with a smug smile on her face, takes a step forward. \"And this year\\'s winners are… … … Troy Bolton and Ryan Evans!\" Ryan and Troy startle, not having expected to actually beat out Sharpey, who stomps her foot her voice coming out in an angry grunt as she storms off stage. They look at each other in astonishment before stumbling forward, still wrapped in each other\\'s arms as they stand next to the clubs\\' manager, smiles so wide that their cheeks begin to hurt. The cheering which erupts almost deafens the two as Troy gestures for Ryan to take the trophy. \"It is thanks to you that we were so good Ry. You put in the most effort.\" He whispers in his boyfriend\\'s ear, placing a soft kiss to the skin just behind causing Ryan to turn around abruptly, crashing his lips to Troy\\'s. Troy happily reciprocates and draws the smaller boy into his chest, their lips massaging and moving against each other\\'s as they express just how happy they are in that moment. Their families come up to the pair, breaking them up so they can congratulate them on both their win and their newly founded relationship. Happy for their boys\\'. The Wildcats also begin to make their way up the aisles, their faces excited for their ex-teammate as they each shout out their congratulations, giving the two boy\\'s hugs as they are passed around the group. Knowing that, even though they might not ever be fully forgiven, that things might not go back to the way things had always been, everything was going to work out fine from now on and they would each spend their time doing whatever it takes to make it up to the couple. A/N Here is another oneshot I have been working on for the past 2 weeks. I know HSM is a pretty much dead fandom at this point but I can help but feel that Troy and Ryan would have made a really adorable couple and decided to try writing a story about them of my own. At first it was only supposed to be a short oneshot, a couple thousand words but as you can see, my pen (or rather keyboard) ran away from me. I hope that whoever reads this enjoys it and please feel free to drop a review on what you think.']","Summary":" ['It\\'s Summer, Everything Changes.

Excellent jobs ladies. That\\'s a wrap\" Johnthan Rome, a world renowned music director, yelled as the crew around him cheered, especially the 5 stars of the music video. Who are the five stars you might ask, well they happen to be me and my friends. Sharpay Evans, my twin sister Alexandra Montez, Taylor McKessie, Kelsi Nelson and me; Gabriella Montez also known as Divine Destiny. For the last 6 years, we have been the hottest girl group in the US. We have sold millions of records, tours and albums. We\\'ve also been best friends since we were 15 years old. We did everything together including sing but none of us guessed that at the age of 26 we would famous singers. When we were juniors in college, we went out to celebrate the end of the semester at a karaoke bar. After about 6 drinks we got up on stage and little did we know our future manger was in the audience. 3 songs and 4 meetings later, Divine Destiny was born. Not only are we famous, but so are our significant others. I\\'m married to the one and only LA Lakers starting point guard, Troy Bolton. We were high school sweethearts ever since the summer before our senior year. We have been married for the past five years and have a beautiful 3 year old daughter, Kaylee Michelle Bolton. She is the spitting image of both of us with my skin tone, nose and smile and Troy\\'s hair color, ears and of course the crystal blue eyes I love oh so much. Sharpay is married to world renown chief, Zeke Baylor. The two got together around the same time as me and Troy and have been married for 3 years. Zeke has been on plenty of cooking shows where he has won and is in the middle of opening his 3rd restaurant. The first two being in LA and New York and this next one in our home town of Albuquerque. My twin sister Alexandra Montez, who is 10 minutes older than me, is married to Sharpay twin Brother, Ryan Evans. The two got together when we were freshman in college. Ryan is a famous composer, writing songs for many singers including Divine Destiny. The two have been married for 2 years. Taylor has been engaged to the LA Lakers starting center, Chad Danforth. They are our closest friends and we have been thick as thieves for years. The two have been engaged for nearly a year. Last but certainly not least, Kelsi is engaged to famous photographer Jason Cross. The two have been engaged for the last 4 months. \"I am so happy that this video shoot is finally over.\" I said as the girls walked to their dressing room. \"Me too, this shoot took way longer than I thought.\" Taylor agreed. \"I feel you on that but I have to say that I think this is going to be the best video yet.\" Kelsi said as the girls all agreed as our team helped us out of our performance clothes. \"How do you think the guys will react?\" Taylor asked with a smirk. \"They are going to try and get us pregnant.\" I said making the girls burst into laughter. \"Too late for that.\" Alex said with a small smile as the girls all turned to look at her. \"What do you mean by that sis?\" I raised her eyebrow as I looked at her younger sister who had a smirk on her face. Alex looked into her purse and pulled out a small photo. \"I\\'m 8 weeks pregnant….with twins\" \"Oh My God!\" We said as we jumped up to hug Alex. \"Alex this is amazing!\" Taylor said as Alex smiled before whipping her eyes. \"Thanks, Ryan is pretty excited too. Although he did faint when he found it was twins.\" The girls are laughed as we hugged Alex again. \"It\\'s good to know I won\\'t be the only one.\" We all looked at Sharpay with raised eyebrows before our mouths dropped. \"Shar are you pregnant too?\" Alex asked as Sharpay smiled and nodded her head. \"6 weeks, but I only have one in here cooking. Thank God.\" \"Shar! That\\'s great! We\\'re going to be pregnant together.\" Alex screamed as the two girls hugged. \"Well since we are all telling exciting news….Jason and I chose a date for the wedding!\" Kelsi cheered. \"When is it?\" Taylor asked with a little jealously in her voice that I noticed. She\\'s been engaged to Chad for almost a year and yet they still haven\\'t picked a date. \"November 12th. And I can\\'t wait. It\\'s about 8 months away so we have enough time to plan everything. At least I hope.\" Kelsi said with a mega watt smile. \"Yay two new babies and a wedding this is going to be amazing.\" I said as the girls all walked towards mine and Shapay\\'s cars. Taylor, Alex and I all drove together back to my place as Sharpay and Kelsi drove together. \"Hey Tay you okay? You\\'ve been a little quiet since we left the shoot.\" Alex ask as Taylor turned to look at her. \"Yea I\\'m fine.\" Taylor replied with a fake smile. I looked in her review mirror and connected eyes with my twin. We have known Taylor too long to let this pass. \"You know we don\\'t believe you right. Come on Tay what\\'s wrong.\" Taylor looked down at her hands before looking at the twins. \"I guess I\\'m a little jealous. Kelsi and Jason have only been engaged for what 4 months and they already have a date for their wedding. Plus Shar and Alex are having babies. No offense Alex….I just feel like I\\'m stuck in one spot.\" The twins looked at each before looking over at Taylor and both reaching over to rub her shoulder. \"We\\'re sorry Tay. Have you talked to Chad about picking a date?\" I asked as Taylor rolled her eyes. \"You know Chad, if I bring it up he\\'ll just do something to change the subject.\" \"Well ask tonight once you get home and see how he reacts. If he does the same thing let us know and we will happily kick his ass for you.\" Alex said making the girls laugh. Bolton Residence Troys POV \"Dude when are the girls getting here I\\'m starving.\" My best friend Chad Danforth asked me as he sat in the living room as we waited for the girls to get back. \"They should be here soon. Ella texted me saying that their video shoot ended about an hour ago.\" I told him as he entered his living room. Every week, once a week the gang would meet up for a group dinner at one of their places and this week so happened to be the our turn. \"Daddyyyyyyy\" I turned my head with a smile towards the back door to the tiny version of my wife running through the door. Kaylee ran towards me, giggling from being chased by her Uncle Zeke and Uncle Jason. \"Up daddy up!\" Kaylee said as she ran straight into my arms. \"God, she\\'s fast for a 3 year old.\" Jason said as he sat down trying to catch a breath. \"Well of course she is, she\\'s a born athlete. Running is in her blood. Isn\\'t that right baby girl.\" Kaylee nodded her head with a smile as she laid her head on my shoulder. \"I can\\'t wait to have my baby.\" All the guys turned their head turns Zeke who had a small smile on his face. \"I\\'m sorry can you repeat that.\" Chad asked as he shook his head causing Zeke to laugh. \"Shars pregnant guys.\" \"No way! So is Alex!\" Ryan said as the two men laughed. \"That\\'s freaky how did you two do that?\" Everyone rolled their eyes at Chad as congratulations to the two future fathers went around. \"I\\'m happy for you guys. There is no greater feeling then holding and seeing your child for the first time.\" I said as kissing the top of Kaylee\\'s head. \"Since we are all sharing news, Kelsi and I chose a date for the wedding. Im going to need all you guys standing by my side on November 12th.\" Jason said proudly. \"Dude that\\'s great! You know we will be there. Hopefully Alex and Shar aren\\'t still pregnant.\" Zeke said making the guys laugh. \"God I feel for you two. Hormones are awful. One minute Gabi was happy and the next she was crying. I walked in our room once and she was crying because of a dog food commercial. Then she got pissed at me for laughing. Pregnancy makes the crazy.\" I told them as Zeke and Ryan looked at each other scared for the next few months. Everyone knew that Alex and Sharpay were the feisty ones out of the group so if Gabriella, who was the calm one out of the girls, was crazy on hormones who knew how their wives would be. \"So Chad, when are you and Taylor going to tie the knot.\" Ryan asked as Chad shrugged his shoulders taking another swig of his beer. \"What\\'s the rush, we are fine with just the engagement.\" \"The rush? Dude you proposed 9 months ago. And you mean to tell me that Taylor, the same Taylor who planned out every aspect of her life, doesn\\'t care that you two haven\\'t chosen a date.\" I raised his eyebrow at my best friend not believing a word he was saying. \"I mean she has brought it up but that was in the beginning. I\\'m perfectly fine with waiting a few more months.\" \"Be prepared for a talk later, especially because I\\'m sure Kelsi told the girls today.\" Jason said as Chad rolled his eyes. He didn\\'t understand where we were coming from. \"So could one of you guys have a boy because our group is definitely outnumbered.\" Chad said making the guys laugh. \"It doesn\\'t work like that Danforth.\" We turned to see the girls all walking into the living room. The girls all came and took a seat by each of us. I pulled my wife down in my lap kissing her square on the lips. \"Hiya beautiful.\" \"Hi handsome how are my two favorite people.\" She asked picking Kaylee up and kissing all over her face causing them both to giggle. \"Mommy, daddy let me have ice cream.\" My mouth dropped as I looked at my daughter avoiding looking at my wife. \"Kay.\" I turned towards Gabriella and gave her a small smile. \"It was only a small bowl.\" Gabriella just rolled her eyes at me as she looked at everyone else. \"How did the shoot go girls.\" Ryan asked as he placed his hand on Alex\\'s stomach. \"Fabulous. This is our best yet.\" \"Which song is this for again?\" Zeke asked. \"Buttons.\" I groaned as I already knew this was a video I was going to have to worry about. \"Please tell me you had on a decent amount of clothes.\" I pleaded with Gabriella as she gave me a sly smile. \"Brieeeee.\" \"Oh calm down it won\\'t be that bad.\" \"I beg to differ. Do you not remember when you guys did the video for Suger.\" I raised my eyebrow as she had yet another sly smile. She knew what that video did to not only me but all the males around the world. \"Oh that was a great video.\" Sharpay said as the girls laughed. \"No it wasn\\'t. Do you not realized how many of our teammates asses we almost had to kick.\" Chad replied as the girls rolled their eyes. \"Anywayyyyyyyy, you guys are defiantly in our wedding. We have to start planning.\" Kelsi clapped her hands as Jason has a mega smile on his face. I noticed Chad and Taylor\\'s body language when everyone started talking about the wedding. I nudged Gabriella and we both silently looked at our best friends thinking the same thing. There defiantly was a elephant in the room and we were waiting for the attack. Chad and Taylor\\'s apartment Taylor\\'s POV I sat on our bed listening to some of the new songs we would be putting out soon. As much as I tried to focus I couldn\\'t get all the news the girls shared today out of my head. I mean first Alex and Sharpay tell us they\\'re pregnant and then Kelsi tells us that they set a date. I think Kelsi\\'s news is what hurts the most. I mean don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m happy for Kelsi and Jason, but at the same time I\\'m jealous as hell. Chad proposed to me damn near a year ago and has yet to say anything about the wedding. I felt him tense up today when we started talking about it. I wonder if the girls were right. Maybe I should say something. I jumped up off the bed and walked into the living room to see Chad on the couch watching ESPN with a beer in his hand. I bit my lip as I wondered if this was the perfect time to say something. Fuck it, it\\'s now or never. \"Chad….\" He turned around with a smile on his face. \"What\\'s up babe.\" I walked around and sat next to him. I placed my legs in his lap as he started to rub my legs. \"Um can we talk.\" He looked at me with a raised eyebrow as he turned the TV off. \"Is everything okay.\" \"You love me right.\" He looked taken back by that question. \"Of course I love you.\" I twisted my engagement ring as I thought about my next question \"You still want to marry me right?\" \"What?!...of course I want to still marry you. Taylor where the hell are these questions coming from?\" I sighed as I knew this wasn\\'t going to end well. \"If you want to still marry me why haven\\'t we picked a date.\" Chad groaned as he closed his eyes and tilted his head back. \"Is this what this is about? Taylor why do we need to pick a date?\" \"Why? Chad we have been engaged longer than Kelsi and Jason and they already have a date planned out. Do you know how embarrassed and jealous I felt when she told us. Every time my mom calls, she asks me how\\'s the planning going and I hurry and change the subject.\" I told him as I was getting irritated. \"Tay, we have only been engaged for what 8-9 months. What\\'s wrong with a long engagement.\" \"Are you fucking serious right now Chad. We have been dating for 7 years! Why would I want to wait any longer to marry you. You seem like you are perfectly fine with just being engaged\" I was pissed by this point. I could tell he was too but I had every right to be pissed. \"And what if I am. Who says we have to rush and get married. Everything is perfect right now.\" \"No it\\'s not Chad! I\\'m ready to get married Chad! I love you and I want to be your wife but I see you aren\\'t ready. I thought we would be half way to our wedding by now. All of our friends are moving on with their lives Chad. Alex and Sharpay are pregnant, Kelsi and Jason are planning a wedding, Hell Gabriella and Troy are damn near on baby number 2. I\\'m tired of not having my happy ending!\" At this point I was up yelling as he rubbed his head. \"What are you trying to say you aren\\'t happy? I\\'m sorry I\\'m not Zeke, Ryan, Jason or Hell Troy at that matter. We will set a date when we are ready! Maybe I want to wait a little longer. We don\\'t have to be in competition with our friends Taylor!\" I shook my head as this was hopeless. \"You know what, you just don\\'t get it. I\\'m not in competition with them but I want to move on with my life and if you can\\'t see that you can go to hell.\" I walked into our room as slammed our door as I heard Chad call my name. I wasn\\'t about to deal with this. I laid on our bed and let the silent tears rolled down my eyes. March 20, 2020 Chads POV It\\'s been four days and Taylor is still pissed at me. You can definitely feel how tense our place is when were in the same room. I honestly think she is overreacting. I\\'m not seeing what the problem is. Who says that once you propose you have to start planning a wedding as soon as possible. If I want to wait a little while before getting married then I should have that right. Hell we have been together since we were 18. What\\'s a few more months before it\\'s official. I parked my car in the airport lot as I went in through the back. Normally Taylor would drop me off, but she was gone before I even woke up. The team was headed to New York for our next game against the Knicks. This was the final game to let us know if we were making it to the playoffs and I wish I was as excited as I\\'ve been before. Every time Taylor and I are into, I play like shit and that can\\'t happen tomorrow night. I need to be on my best game because we need this win. I called Taylor and it went straight to voicemail. I sighed as I left her a voicemail. \"Hey Tay. I was hoping to see you before I left but I guess not. Um call me once you get this. I love you.\" I walked further to into the airport to see half the team kissing their love ones goodbye. I looked over and saw my best friend with his family and I just groaned. Why did our best friends have to be the cover family for Worlds Best Family. Troys POV \"Daddy is going to miss you soooo much.\" I placed kisses all over my daughters face as she giggled and wrapped her arms around my neck. \"Daddy why can\\'t we go with you?\" My heart broke as I looked at my daughter pout. This was the one part about my job I hated. I could barely handle being away from Gabriella but Kaylee was a different level. Sometimes they would fly out to the games but Gabriella had a photo shoot tomorrow so they had to miss this one. \"I\\'m sorry baby girl. You have to stay with mommy but I\\'ll be home before you know it.\" As soon as I saw the tears in her eyes, it took everything in me not to just say forget the game. I looked at my wife, who just had a small smile and rubbed her back. \"She\\'ll be fine. You know how she is.\" I nodded my head as I pulled them both into a hug. I kissed the top of their heads before we pulled back. Gabriella placed her hand on my cheek as she kissed me. \"Please be safe. Call me if you need me. I\\'ll call as soon as we land.\" I looked over at my daughter who looked back at me with the same eyes I own. \"Princess….Daddy promises to FaceTime you every night and when I come home we will cuddle and watch all the princesses movies you want okay?\" I gave her a small smile as she smiled back at me and nodded her head. She leaned over to hug me as I pulled her in arms. \"I love you daddy\" I closed my eyes as I pulled her close. That will forever be my favorite word. \"I love you too baby girl.\" I looked at Brie and kissed her again before passing our daughter back to her. \"I love you Mrs. Bolton.\" \"I love you too handsome. Go kick ass,\" \"Always.\" I winked as I walked through security and towards the plane. Getting on the plane I saw my best friend leaning his head against one of the windows. I could tell something was wrong with him. Of course I knew what it was about because Taylor has been talking to Brie. I sat next to him as I nudged him. \"Everything okay dude?\" \"Yea.\" Yup definitely a lie. \"Chad come on. Taylor has been talking to Gabriella. What\\'s going on.\" He rolled his eyes as he looked at me. \"Of course she\\'ll talk to her but she won\\'t say a word to me. She\\'s pissed because we haven\\'t picked a date. She said she was jealous because the rest of you are moving on with your lives and she feels like our relationship is at a stand still.\" \"I mean can you blame her Chad? You proposed before Jason and they already have their date.\" \"Dude you\\'re supposed to be on my side.\" \"I\\'m not choosing sides but think about it Chad. The girls have been discussing their weddings since college. That\\'s all girls talk about. She probably just wants to make sure you still care.\" Chad rolled his eyes as he pulled out his headphones. \"A wedding doesn\\'t prove that.\" He placed his headphones in his ears as I shook my head. This definitely was going to back fire and God knows all hell is going to break lose. March 21st, 2020 Taylor\\'s POV \"These pictures came out amazing.\" Kelsi said as we looked over the photos from our shoot with Peoples Magazine earlier today. We were all at Gabriella\\'s place getting ready to watch Chads and Troys big game. \"I look fat.\" Both Sharpay and Alex groaned as we all looked over at them with small smiles. \"You two are not fat. You barely look pregnant in these photos.\" I told them they rolled their eyes. \"Wait until you get pregnant, then we\\'ll be having the same conversation.\" I laughed as the boys entered the living room with the our food. \"You girls ready for the big game\" Zeke said excitedly as If the Lakers won then they would be in the playoffs. \"Duh, they have been working so hard they definitely need this win.\" Gabriella replied with a smile. I agreed with her because if they lost I don\\'t know what state Chad would be in. Normally when he argued he put all his focus into basketball because it made him feel better but he still didn\\'t play that well. This was a huge game and he really needed to focus and he can\\'t do that if we are arguing. I excused myself as I went into the kitchen and called Chad. The game wasn\\'t due to start for another hour so hopeful he could answer. Hey this is Chad, if I missed your call I\\'m probably playing basketball. Leave a message at the beep . I sighed as I really wanted to talk to him. \"Hey babe. I was hoping you would answer but I guess you are getting ready for the game. I really miss you. I\\'m sorry for being angry at you. We can talk about everything later but I\\'m really sorry baby. I hope you kill it tonight. I love you.\" I closed my eyes as I hoped he would listen to the message and call me back tonight. \"You okay Tay?\" I turned around to see Gabriella grabbing some plates. \"Yea I was um just calling Chad. Voicemail.\" I told her with a shrug. She gave me a hopeful look as she gave me a hug. \"I\\'m sorry you guys are fighting Tay but you know Chad. That boy loves you. He will see you call and jump to try and call you back.\" I smiled at her as I nodded my head and whipped away a tear. \"He will be home tomorrow and you two will be making out before you know it.\" We laughed as we walked back into the living room to grab food. I sat on the couch and prayed that Gabriella as right. Chad POV I walked over to my locker and took a sip of water as we were in halftime with the score tied at 52-52. We were killing it but the Knicks definitely were making us work for it. I check my phone and frowned as I saw I had a missed call and message from Taylor. Listening to the message my heart broke as I listened to her message. She sounded so sad and I couldn\\'t help but feel regret. Both of us are so fucking stubborn but I let this go on for two long. \"You okay dude?\" I looked up to see Troy with a towel in his hand. \"Yea, just listening to a message from Tay. God I miss her.\" I looked down at my phone and smiled as I looked at the picture of the both of us from one of the latest award shows we had to attention. \"Call her back later on tonight. I know she\\'s over at our house watching the game. Brie told me when I talked to her and Kaylee right before it started.\" \"Yea I am. Not talking to her has definitely giving me a lot of time to think. She was right. It\\'s not fair that I\\'ve been putting this wedding off.\" \"Well look at you making grown up decisions.\" I rolled my eyes as Troy just laughed at me and patted my back. \"I\\'m just messing with you dude. I think you\\'re making the right decision.\" \"Thanks now lets go win this game.\" Troy POV I just got out the shower at my hotel room as I was getting ready to call my beautiful girls. God I miss the hell out of them. Don\\'t get me wrong I\\'m happy as hell that we won and are in the playoffs but it would\\'ve felt 10x better if my girls were there. I looked at my phone as saw that is was almost time for Kaylee to go to bed so I grabbed my phone and FaceTimed them. It rang three times before my baby girl\\'s face popped up on the screen. \"Daddy!\" I laughed at the excitement coming from her voice. \"Hi princess\" \"daddy you won!\" \"I did win. Do you know what that means? Daddy only has to play a couple of more games before he gets to play for the big trophy.\" Her eyes grew to the size of a saucer at the word trophy. She loved to go into Brie and mines trophy room and look at all of our trophies. \"Can me and mommy come to the games.\" I laughed as I nodded my head. I didn\\'t know who was my bigger fan between her and Gabriella but boy did I love it. \"Of course you can baby. You and mommy will be in the front row as always.\" She smiled back at me with that smile that would make me do anything. \"Daddy when are you coming home?\" \"I\\'ll be back tomorrow and me and you can watch Cinderella and cuddle on the couch. That sound good.\" She nodded as I smiled back at her. \"Now I think it\\'s time for someone to go to bed.\" \"Okay I love you daddy.\" \"I love you too.\" We blew each other a kiss as she handed the phone over to my other favorite girl. \"There is my beautiful wife.\" She giggled as I felt my heart burst. \"Good game handsome. You didn\\'t bend your arms like I told you too which is why you missed that free throw but still good game.\" I rolled my eyes as she would always do this even in high school and college but I found it hot. \"Thanks coach.\" She laughed as I smiled back at her. \"I miss you baby.\" \"I miss you too but we\\'ll see each other tomorrow.\" \"Mmhmm And I can\\'t wait. How about after I have daddy-daughter time we have some Troy-Gabriella time.\" I wiggled my eyebrows as she laughed as shook her head. \"I think something can be arranged.\" She said with that look that got me every time. I groaned as she knew what the hell she was doing. All I wanted to do was be home with my girls. \"You going out with the boys?\" \"I was thinking about it but I much rather talk to you.\" \"Go ahead and celebrate with the boys. I have to get some sleep anyway, we have to be at the studio early. Just be safe.\" \"Will do baby. I love you. I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\" \"I love you too baby.\" She blew me a kiss as we hung up and I got ready to go meet the guys down in the bar. Going downstairs I saw most of my teammates celebrating including my best friend who looked drunk. \"Hoops!\" Yup he was drunk. \"How many drinks have you had Chad.\" \"Only 4 but I\\'ve had a couple of shoots.\" I shook my head and laughed. \"Dude I deserve it after that three pointer Winning shot.\" He said grinning like a Chesters cat. \"Whatever you say dude.\" I moved around to grab a shot as I ordered myself a drink. March 22nd, 2020 1:15am Chads POV I knocked back what I think was my 7th shot of the night. I don\\'t know I lost count. \"I think you\\'ve had enough dude.\" I felt Troy take my drink out of my hand. \"I\\'m fine.\" I slurred as he shook his head. \"Chad you\\'ve had enough. Come on we have a flight to catch tomorrow anyway.\" I shook my head as I pushed him away. \"I\\'ll go to bed after another drink.\" \"Dude come on. Don\\'t you have to call Taylor anyway.\" I rolled my eyes. \"I called her and left her message. I\\'ll see her tomorrow. I need another drink before I have to do all this wedding talk.\" \"Whatever you say man. I\\'m going to bed.\" I shrugged my shoulder as he walked away and I ordered myself another drink. I reached for my card to pay when another card was given to the bar tender. I looked up to see a pretty nice looking African American brown hair girl was standing next to me. She was hot but Taylor looked better. \"I got this.\" She looked over at me as a smile flirted on her face. \"Uh thanks but you didn\\'t have to do that.\" \"No problem. I wanted to thank you for that winning shot against the Knicks. One step closer to bringing that trophy to LA.\" I raised my eyebrow at her. \"You saw the game.\" She giggled as she sat down at the bar next to me. \"I was at the game. I love basketball. Played it in high school, could have in college but modeling was my true passion.\" \"Oh a model nice. You from LA?\" \"Born and raised, which is why that trophy would be nice.\" I laugh as I nodded my head. \"Would you like to dance?\" She looked at me with that flirty look I get from a lot of fans. Something in me told me to say no but one little dance wouldn\\'t hurt right? 9:00am Chads POV I groaned as I heard my alarm ring in my ear. I quickly shut it off as my head was pounding. How much did I drink last night? I rolled over to cover my face with the pillow, put something was blocking me. I looked over to see brown hair laid out on the pillow. My eyes grew as I looked around the room and noticed I wasn\\'t in my room and my clothes were laid out on the floor. Who the fuck was this girl? What the hell did I do? My phone went off again as I had to hurry and get ready to be at the airport but all I could think about was what happened last night. I just remember drinking and after that everything was a blur. I closed my eyes as I tried to take deep breaths. I snuck out of the bed, threw my clothes on and hurried out of the room. Once I reached my room, I hurried inside and slide down my room door as I closed my eyes trying to catch my breath. What the fuck Chad. 3:45pm Chad and Taylor\\'s apartment Chads POV I walked up the stairs to our apartment floor as I felt like I was going to puke. All I could think about was what I did. I can\\'t believe I would cheat on Taylor. I felt like crap. How was I supposed to tell her. Oh God, what if she cancels the engagement. I can\\'t lose her. I hate it when she doesn\\'t talk to me, but if she leave me, I don\\'t know what I will do. When I got to the door, I took a deep breathe before opening the it. I heard the shower run in our bathroom. I paced our room as I tried to think about what I was going to say. \"Come on Chad. If you tell her now maybe she will just understand that it was all a mistake.\" I groaned as I knew that was a lie. Who am I kidding she\\'s going to kill me. \"Chad!\" I jumped as I looked to see Taylor in a towel. I gulped as she looked beautiful in just that. She jumped into my arms as I breathed in her scent. \"God I missed you.\" \"I missed you too baby. Great game.\" She pulled back smiling at me as I smiled and moved her hair out of her face. \"Thanks baby.\" \"Listen about our fight-\" I placed my finger over her lips as I shook my head. \"Forget it. It\\'s in the past. How about you get some clothes on and we can look at the calendar and our schedules and figure out what day we want to get married.\" He eyes lit up and I felt my heart crack. How was I supposed to tell her? \"Really.\" I nodded my head as she squealed and kiss me and ran off to get ready. I laid back on the bed and closed my eyes. I mean maybe it was better if she didn\\'t know. Right? What do you all think? Will Chad tell Taylor about his one night stand? This story wont be that long maybe 2-3 chapters long but i kind of know where it is headed. Please drop a review and let me know what you think.'][Chapter 2] ['3 months later June 18,2020 Chads POV It\\'s been three months since everything has happened. Troy and I lead the team to championship ring and we are still on high from it. This made ring number 2 for us. Zeke successfully opened his third restaurant which is already a big hit. Kelsi and Jason are in full wedding mode while Sharpay is four months pregnant and Alex is five months pregnant. You can definitely tell that they were pregnant. I felt sorry for Ryan and Zeke too because man have their hormones kicked in. Taylor and I finally set a date for February 23rd and I couldn\\'t be more excited. I have no idea what I was thinking before, but I couldn\\'t wait to finally make her my wife. I decided not to tell Taylor because I mean what\\'s the point. I\\'ll never see the girl again so why make matters worse. It\\'s behind me and I can move on with my life and be happy. Right now we were all at the American Music Awards to cheer on the girls we were nominated for 5 awards. They had already won Song of the Year and Best Collaboration. \"I\\'m going to run to the bathroom.\" I whispered to Taylor as it was intermission. \"Okay hurry back. I think another award we\\'re nominated for is next.\" I nodded as I kissed her forehead before walking towards the bathroom. After doing my business, I walked out the bathroom, looking down at my phone, when I accidentally bumped into someone. \"Oh I\\'m sorry.\" I looked up and my breath stopped as it was the girl from New York. \"Well funny run into you here.\" She said with a smirk. I could tell that she was pissed just by how she looked at me. I also noticed the small baby bump through her dress not that she was trying to hide it. \"Um do I know you.\"I was hoping that If I pretended not to know her this would all go away. \"Please don\\'t act dumb Chad. It\\'s me, Jessica, from New York. You definitely were drunk last time I saw you but I know for a fact you won\\'t forget that night.\" I cringed as I closed my eyes and tried to breath. \"What are you doing here?\" I hadn\\'t seen her in three months and now all of a sudden she shows up. \"I was invited to present so I thought why not. Oh it\\'s good to see you too by the way. You know I never took as someone to fuck and leave.\" My eyes snapped up at that statement. \"Keep your voice down.\" I said as I looked around to make sure nobody heard her. \"Why? People are going to find out sooner than later. I mean this is your baby.\" She rubbed her stomach as my jaw dropped. \"What?!\"I couldn\\'t have heard her right. \"I\\'m pregnant Chad. With your child.\" I squinted my eyes as I looked at her. \"You\\'re lying\" she rolled her as she shook her head. \"I have no reason to lie Chad. I\\'m a Victoria Secret Angel. I make plenty of money so it\\'s not like I slept with you for the money. I did it because I wanted to. Honestly I\\'m surprised you did. Aren\\'t you engaged.\" She crossed her arms as she smirked at me. This bitch knew I was engaged! \"You fucking knew I was in a relationship and still kissed me! That\\'s sick.\" I was pissed at this point. She just shrugged her shoulders as she looked at me. \"Not my problem. You\\'re the one in a relationship. I just thought you would want to know about your child. Tell me…. how do you think Taylor will feel about this?\" She smirked as My Jaw dropped. She was definitely a monster. \"You leave her out of this.\" \"You better tell her or I will.\" I Looked at her as I couldn\\'t believe this was happening. \"It\\'s not mine!\" I yelled at her as I looked around once again. It\\'s way to many people here who don\\'t need to hear this conversation. \"Take a test I bet it\\'s positive.\" She shrugged her shoulders as this was definitely a nightmare. Before I could say anything I noticed Troy walking up to me. I turned back to look at Jessica with wide eyes. \"Don\\'t say anything.\" \"Dude where have you been? The show is about to start.\" I nodded my head as I thanked Troy for this rescue. \"Sorry I\\'m coming.\" \"It was nice seeing you again Chad.\" I cringed again as Jessica smirked and walked away. \"Who was that?\" Troy asked as I shocked my head. \"Nobody, lets get back to our seats before Taylor kills me.\" June 21st, 2020 Gabriella\\'s POV We all finally had an off day from our busy lives so us girls decided to have lunch at my house today. I also invited one of our friends from New York who we haven\\'t seen in forever. I walked downstairs towards the living room to see a scene that warmed my heart. Troy and Kaylee were playing on the floor together and seeing them together always made me smile. Troy has picked Kaylee up and placed kisses all over her face making her laugh. \"Mommy!\" I looked up to see my family looking at me with smiles as I walked over to them and sat my Troy on the couch. I placed Kaylee in my lap as I hugged her close to me. \"What are you doing princess?\" \"Me and daddy are coloring. Look!\" I smiled as I looked at her picture of me, her and Troy. \"Very pretty baby girl. Why don\\'t you go put it on the fridge.\" She smiled as she jumped down and ran off to the kitchen. I looked over at my husband as I kissed him. \"How are you today Mrs. Bolton?\" \"I\\'m good. What time are you leaving for Chad\\'s?\" I asked as Troy looked down at his watched. \"Um in like 15 minutes. I still don\\'t understand why he wants to meet with all of us. He said he had something to tell us.\" \"With Chad you never know.\" I giggled as Troy laughed. \"Yea you\\'re right about that. I\\'m going to go finish getting ready.\" As Troy walked upstairs, the doorbell rang. I walked over and opened it to see Taylor and Alex at the door. \"Hey.\" I said as we hugged and I let them in the door. \"How are my niece and nephew.\" I asked with a smile as I rubbed my sisters five month belly which was huge, but I mean she was pregnant with twins. \"Kicking like crazy.\" Alex said as she rolled her eyes. \"Ugh How did you end up not having twins.\" Taylor and I laughed as we sat next to her on the couch. Kaylee came running in to say hi to her aunts before going to play with some of her toys. \"Troy and I aren\\'t done having kids so we might actually have twins.\" \"If we have twins I might shit myself.\" Troy said coming down the stairs. I sent him a glare as I looked over at our daughter who wasn\\'t paying attention. He sent me a small smile as he kissed my forehead before saying hi to the girls. He rubbed Alex stomach and she slapped it away making us all laugh. \"Stop it you\\'re making them kick more.\" \"That\\'s because they know I\\'m their favorite uncle.\" I rolled my eyes as he chuckled before going to kiss Kaylee and I goodbye. \"I\\'ll catch you guys later.\" \"Guys guess who I invited over. Remember Jessica Thompson from the fashion show. She\\'s in town and I asked her to come over.\" \"God I haven\\'t seen her in forever.\" Taylor said as I started to get lunch ready for us. 10 minutes later the doorbell rang again and I went to the door to see the rest of the girls. \"Hey look who we found.\" Kelsi said as Jessica was walking up the driveway. \"Hey girl!\" I let her in as we all hugged and started catching up. \"Oh my God Jessica your bump is so cute. How far along are you?\" Taylor asked as Jessica smiled before rubbing her belly. \"3 months.\" \"My God is this the year of the babies.\" Sharpay said with a giggle as she rubbed on her belly as well. Her and Zeke found out they were having a little boy as well bringing our baby group to an even 2 boys and 2 girls. \"I guess you can say that. This was a little unexpected.\" \"Was your boyfriend happy?\" Kelsi asked. \"We actually aren\\'t together. After I found out I flew back home to be closer to my mom and my baby\\'s dad. I actually just told him.\" \"Oh who is he? Do we know him?\" I asked. I looked at her as she had this certain look in her eyes. \"Yea you do actually it\\'s Chad.\" The room got extremely quiet as we all looked at her. \"Chad who?\" Alex asked the question we were all scared to ask. \"Chad Danforth.\" Our mouths dropped as we couldn\\'t believe what she said. I turned to look at Taylor as she looked as if all the blood in her body had disappeared. What the hell is happening. Chads POV I paced the living room floor as I had asked all of the guys to come over plus my publicist, Aaron. He defiantly had to know what was going on if anything came out. I couldn\\'t get what Jessica told me out of my head. Pregnant. Three months. My baby. How in the Hell was this my baby. I mean we only slept together once. I groaned as I thought this was behind me. What the hell am I supposed to do. \"Uh Chad you want to tell us why you called us here.\" I looked over to see my friends all looking at me. I sighed as it was now or never. \"Uh Troy do you remember that girl you saw me with at the award show.\" \"Yea. What about her?\" \"Her name is Jessica. I met her when we were in New York for the game before the playoffs. She\\'s uh..she\\'s pregnant.\" The guys looked at me confused. \"Okay so what. Why do you care.\" Zeke asked as I let out a shaker breath. \"She says it\\'s my baby.\" I said quietly. \"What?!\" All the guys looked at me in shock as I cringed. \"Chad what the hell do you mean it\\'s your baby?\" Ryan asked as I shook my head. \"I was drunk okay. She bought me a drink at the bar, she asked me to dance and the next thing I know I wake up in her hotel room.\" \"You have got to be kidding me. Chad you cheated on Taylor! What the hell were you thinking!?\" Troy yelled at me as I lowered my head. \"Why didn\\'t you say anything?\" \"I don\\'t know! I thought that maybe I could put it behind me but she shows up and says she\\'s three months pregnant. I mean it can\\'t be my baby right.\" \"Chad you need to take a paternity test.\" Jason said as my head jumped up. \"No! I am not doing that. It\\'s not my baby! We had sex once.\" \"All it takes is one time!\" Troy yelled as I shook my head. \"Look I didn\\'t call you guys I over here to judge me.\" \"Chad they are right. You need to get on top of this before anything comes out. You and Taylor are famous and you know how the paparazzi love getting news on you guys.\"Aaron said as I placed my head in my hands. \"If I take this test it makes things real.\" \"And if you don\\'t matters are going to get worse.\" Ryan said. \"Chad you know better than this. How could you do this to Taylor?\" Troy asked as I could tell they were all disappointed in me. \"Does Taylor know?\" I looked at Jason as if he grew ten heads. \"Hell no she doesn\\'t know. Do you think I would sill be living if she knew. I was going to tell her the day we flew back to LA but I just….I couldn\\'t.\" \"Dude you need to tell her before she finds out.\" Troy said as their was a loud commotion outside our apartment. \"CHAD NICHOLAS DANFORTH OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR RIGHT NOW!\" My eyes grew ten times bigger as I looked at the door knowing whose voices those were. \"Oh shit.\" \"Dude go open the door.\" Zeke said as I shook my head. \"Hell no so they can kill me I think not.\" Aaron looked at us confused as the banging on the door got louder. \"Why are you guys looking like that. Who\\'s at the door?\" \"Gabriella and Kelsi.\" I swallowed the lump in my throat. \"I\\'ve meet them… they\\'re nice.. what\\'s the problem.\" \"Uh no dude. They may be the quiet and calm ones but oh boy when they are pissed they are like Sharpay on her nicest day.\" Jason said as we all agreed. \"Troy go open the door.\" I looked at my best friend as he looked at me like I was crazy. \"No thank you. Haven\\'t you heard the statement Happy Wife, Happy Life. She probably already is going to kill me because I\\'m your best friend.\" \"Chad!\" They only got louder as I was scared shitless. \"I\\'ll answer it.\" Ryan hopped up and ran to the door. \"Hey girls. How you doing?\" \"Where the hell is Chad Evans?\" \"Uh he\\'s not here at the moment can I take a message?\" We heard Ryan yelp as Gabriella had gripped his collar and brought him closer to her. \"Ryan I swear to God if you don\\'t move, you will be in the hospital long before my sister goes into labor.\" Gabriella said with fire in her eyes. \"He\\'s in the living room.\" \"Dude!\" I ran behind Aaron as the girls turned the corner. \"Hey girls. How-\" \"Aaron we like you but move.\" Aaron did as Kelsi said as I looked at the two girls with wide eyes. \"H…Hey.\" \"What the fuck Chad! How could you cheat on Taylor!\" I cringed as I looked at them. \"I didn\\'t meant to I was drunk.\" \"Oh and that makes it okay? What the hell were you thinking.\" Gabriella said as you could see fire in her eyes. \"Taylor is crushed.\" My head spun around to Kelsi as I felt the blood in my body leave. \"She knows?\" \"Of course she knows how the hell do you think we know.\" Gabriella stated as she rolled her eyes. \"I invited Jessica to my house with us and guess what. She told us who her baby daddy is and to our amazement she tells us that his name is Chad fucking Danforth. Taylor damn near fainted.\" Gabriella explained as I felt the tears come to my eyes. \"Wait how do you girls know her?\" I asked confused. \"We met her when we preformed at the Victoria Secret Fashion Show last year.\" I shook me head. Perfect Taylor would know the girl who is trying to destroy our relationship. \"Where is she now?\" I asked quietly. I heard them both sigh as they looked at me. \"She\\'s at my house crying her eyes out. Alex and Shar are with her.\" Gabriella said as I nodded my head. I didn\\'t even have to see her but my heart was breaking because I knew I had fucked up. \"You\\'re lucky we came because those two are ready to chew your head off.\" Kelsi said as I knew she was right. An angry Kelsi and Gabriella was scary but an angry and pregnant Sharpay and Alexandra was terrifying. \"God what am I going to do.\" I placed my head in my hands as I prayed from a miracle. Gabriella POV I stood in the kitchen making dinner as I thought about the events from today. Once Kelsi and I left Chad and Taylor\\'s place, we came back to my house to find Taylor still in tears. She cried and cried for hours and all we could do was hug her and tell her everything was going to be okay. I sighed because even I didn\\'t know if that was true. How do you come back from finding out that not only did your fiancé cheat on you but also get the girl pregnant. \"Momma?\" I looked down to see Kaylee standing next to me. \"Yes baby?\" \"When is daddy coming home?\" I looked up at the clock in the kitchen to see it was almost 5. Troy had text me a little while ago saying that he was headed home. \"He would be here soon. How about you go watch tv in the living room and wait for him okay.\" She nodded her head as I kissed the top of head before she ran off. Not even five minutes later I heard the garage door open and close and then our front door open. I walked out of the kitchen to the living room just in time to catch Kaylee in Troy\\'s arms. Our eyes locked as we knew we had to talk about the events involving our best friends. \"Hey baby girl, can you go play in your room. Mommy and Daddy need to talk.\" Kaylee nodded her head before Troy kissed her forehead and let her free to run upstairs. He pulled me in for a hug as we just stayed like that for a minute. \"How\\'s Taylor?\" Troy asked after a while of us being quiet. I looked up at him as he shook his head. \"I know dumb question.\" I sighed as I pulled back and walked over to the coach with Troy following. \"She cried for hours Troy. You should have seen her face when Jessica said Chad was the father. She looked like she stopped breathing. And Jessica…God she looked as if she knew what she was doing. I mean what the hell everyone knows that they are together.\" I shook my head as I couldn\\'t understand this. I hated groupies and celebrity groupies were worse. \"You know how it is Brie. People don\\'t care. Look how many men flirt with you or women with me.\" \"I just can\\'t believe Chad would do this. I mean they have been together for almost as long as us.\" \"I feel bad. I could\\'ve stopped this.\" Troy said as he ran his fingers through his hair. \"How?\" \"I knew he was drunk. I told him to stop. To come back to the rooms but he pushed me off. I should\\'ve made him Brie!\" I rubbed his hands as I had him look at me. I could tell he really did feel bad. \"Troy, Chad is 27 not 7. He knows what he did was wrong. Even if he was drunk. He can\\'t always rely on his best friend.\" I rubbed his hair out of his face as he nodded. \"I know but still maybe if I would\\'ve tried harder. We told him that he needed to get the paternity test done. That\\'s what took me so long. We went with him to make sure he did it.\" \"Even if he isn\\'t the father, Taylor is still pissed off. She\\'s staying at a hotel tonight because she said she can\\'t see Chad tonight. I told her she could stay here but she said she needed to think away from all of us.\" I looked over at the picture of all of us from when the boys won the finals. We looked so happy and to think that all of this happened and we didn\\'t even know. \"I can\\'t imagine being in Taylor\\'s position.\" I felt Troy grab my hands as he turned me to face him. He rubbed my cheek as he kissed my forehead. \"And you never have too. I haven\\'t looked at another girl since I realized my feelings for you. You are my life. You and Kaylee. I will never do anything to jeopardize that.\" I sighed as I laid my head in his chest. \"What are we going to do to help them?\" \"I don\\'t think there is anything we can do babe.\" I closed my eyes as I prayed he was wrong for once. June 22, 2020 Taylor\\'s Hotel Room Taylor\\'s POV I groaned as my head was pounding from all the crying. I can\\'t believe yesterday actually happened. Every time I closed my eyes, I hoped that it was all some awful nightmare but of course it wasn\\'t. I felt the tears come back to my eyes as I just thought about it all. When Jessica said that Chad was her baby\\'s father I could\\'ve died. Chad has done a lot of stupid things in his life, Hell in our relationship but this….this has to be the worse he\\'s done. He hid the fact that he slept with this girl for 3 months and what\\'s worse is he got her pregnant. I felt so stupid. He came home, apologized for the fight and told me that he was finally ready to set a date. I should\\'ve known that something was up. I rolled over to grab my phone and say 17 text and 32 missed calls from Chad. I couldn\\'t face him not right now. I knew he was going to want to talk but I couldn\\'t even look at him right now. I closed my eyes as I had to get away from him. I had found a nice apartment in the city to stay. I couldn\\'t live with Chad after this. I checked the time to see it was almost 9am. Normally Chad goes for a run so hopefully I could get to the apartment to collect my stuff before he got back. Closing my eyes I took a deep breath as I couldn\\'t believe that my relationship had fell apart in a matter of hours. Chads POV Reaching my apartment building, I used my shirt to wipe the sweat off my face as I had just came back from my hour run. Well today I made it a two hour run. I had way too much on my mind. Taylor never came home last night and she hasn\\'t been answering any of my calls. Gabriella told me she was staying at a hotel. I figured she wouldn\\'t answer my calls but my God I wish she would\\'ve come home. I had so much I needed to tell her. If she just let me explain maybe all of this would work it self out. I shook my head as I groaned. What was I thinking, of course this wouldn\\'t work itself out. After I took the test, I had Aaron get me Jessica\\'s number and we met last night to talk. I told her that I would take the test only to prove that this wasn\\'t my kid. She just laughed in my face. God if she wasn\\'t a girl. I had to wait two weeks to get the results back and when it says that I\\'m not the father all of this will be behind me. Opening my apartment door, I heard movement in the bedroom and I saw bags by the door. My eyes grew as I knew what this was. Running into the bedroom, I saw Taylor throwing her stuff in bags. \"Taylor…\" her head snapped towards me and I felt my heart break as I could tell she had been crying. \"Taylor..what…what are you doing?\" I walked to her and tried to pull her closer to me but her hand connected to my face. Yup, I probably deserved that. \"Don\\'t fucking touch me you asshole.\" I looked at Taylor and saw the fire in her eyes. \"Tay please, just let me explain.\" I begged her as she shook her head. \"Explain what Chad? How could you fucking cheat on me! I thought you loved me.\" \"I do! Taylor please, It was a mistake. I was drunk! She asked me to dance, and the next thing I know I wake up in her bed.\" \"So you think that makes it okay?! I\\'m just supposed to forgive you because you were drunk. Newsflash Chad it wasn\\'t the liquors fault you slept with her it was yours.\" She continued to move around grabbing her stuff as I followed her. \"I\\'m not trying to make an excuse, but baby please I promise you I didn\\'t mean for any of this to happen. I love you Taylor..more than anything.\" \"If you love me, you wouldn\\'t even danced with her Chad. Do you know how many guys have tried to buy me a drink or try and dance with me? A million! But guess what I always say no!\" I had never seen Taylor this angry before. I tried to pull her close to me as she hit my chest over and over. I pulled her in as she cried into my chest. \"I\\'m sorry Taylor. I\\'m so sorry.\" She pulled back and pushed me off of her and walked into the living room. I ran after her and pulled her back. \"Tay..baby, please don\\'t leave.\" \"You know what hurts the most Chad?\" I looked into her eyes to see angry, disappointment and most importantly hurt. \"It\\'s not the fact that you cheated on me, it\\'s the fact that you got her pregnant,\" Taylor whispered. \"That isn\\'t my baby!\" \"How do you know! She\\'s three months pregnant Chad. It\\'s been three months since you slept with her.\" I leaned my head back as I closed my eyes. \"She could be lying. I took the test. We\\'ll know in two weeks.\" \"You think I\\'m just supposed to wait. What happens if it\\'s positive?\" \"We will cross that road when we come to it.\" I grabbed her hands as Taylor shooked her head as she looked at me with tears in her eyes. \"Chad all I\\'ve ever wanted since we were in college was to be your wife and start a family with you. I\\'m not going to be able to watch you do that with another women.\" \"She means nothing to me baby. You are everything to me. You always have been.\" I whipped away her tears as she closed her eyes. She lowered her head as she looked at our hands. My breathing stopped as I watched her take her engagement ring off her finger and place it in my hand. \"I can\\'t do this Chad.\" \"Taylor please\" I begged with tears in my eyes as I tried to make her look at me but it was no use. \"Goodbye Chad.\" I watched as Taylor grabbed her bags and walked not only out the door but also out of my life. I dropped to my knees as the tears finally dropped. I starred at the ring in my hand as I felt like I was going to throw up. The girl of my dreams, the only girl I\\'ve ever loved just walked out on me and I have no clue how I\\'m going to get her back. 1:45am Chads POV I laid in our…I guess my bed as I couldn\\'t get to sleep. I haven\\'t eaten or talked to anyone since Taylor left. I tried to call her but it was going straight to voicemail. I don\\'t even know where she was living at now. I reached over towards my side table and picked up the 3.5 kart engagement ring she gave back. When she gave me back the ring I wanted to burst into tears. If I could take back that one mistake I would. I never thought that me sleeping with her would cause all of this trouble. Hearing Taylor say she couldn\\'t watch me have a family with another women hurt. I felt like complete shit. I hurt her to the point where I don\\'t even know if I\\'m ever going to get her back. I just have to think positive now. Once the test comes back negative, I\\'m going to do everything possible to get my girl back. I rolled over to my side as I stared at Taylor\\'s side of the bed. It felt so cold. For as long as I could remember she has always laid right next to me. I closed my eyes as I thought back to the happier times we had together. I was at my locker, packing up for the day. I was excited it was finally the weekend. This week had been hell but we had a three day weekend and only four more months of high school before we were finally high school graduates. \" Guess who.\" I smiled as I felt a pair of hands cover my eyes. \" Uhhh Hallie Berry.\" \" Oh ha ha very funny\" I turned around with a smile and leaned against my locker to see my girlfriend of 8 months, Taylor Mckessie. \" Ah you know I\\'m just kidding babe.\" \" Mmhmm\" I smiled as I pulled her in for a kiss. \" Ready for the weekend?\" She asked me as we walked to my car. \" Oh yea. You, me and the gang all up at the Evans lake house. I defiantly need this mini vacation.\" \" Speaking of, we need to go to the mall. \" I groaned as I leaned my head against my car. \" Oh come on Chad I need a new swim suit. If you promise not to whine I\\'ll even model the swimsuits for you.\" My head snapped up to see my oh so sexy girlfriend smirking at me. \" Promise?\" she giggled as she pulled me closer to her. \" Promise.\" I smiled as I kissed her and hoped in the car. \" What are we waiting for let\\'s go!\" I felt the tears slide down my face as I wish we could go back to being young and in love. Back before we became famous and back before I made the biggest mistake in my life. I looked over at the picture of the two of us on vacation on the night stand. I traced her beautiful face as I wished she was here next to me, laying in my arms asleep. I\\'d give anything for that to happen. \"I promise you Tay, I\\'ll make this right.\" What do you guys think? Do you think Chad is the father? Do you think Taylor did the right thing in ending their relationship? Leave a review with your thoughts!'][Chapter 3] ['July 6,2020 Chads POV 2:15pm I looked at the envelope in my hand. It stared back at me. Tempting me to open it, but I couldn\\'t. I was scared shitless. What if this says that I am the father? I don\\'t know how to be a father! I mean yes I have siblings but that\\'s different. I groaned as I couldn\\'t do this alone. I had called both Aaron and Troy because I needed them to be here. I really wanted Taylor but she won\\'t even speak to me. In the last two weeks, I\\'ve called her almost one hundred times and I\\'ve gotten nothing. I looked over at one of the many pictures of us. We were in Jamaica, on the beach and she was on my back with both of us smiling. That was actually the day before I had proposed to her. God we were so happy. \" Chad…\" I turned around to see my girlfriend, Taylor McKessie, walking out of the bathroom of our hotel room. We we in Jamaica on vacation. At least that\\'s what she thought. I actually was planning on proposing tonight which is why I have been out of it all day. \" You okay baby. You seem kind of spacey….\" I cleared my throat as I nodded my head. \" Yea I\\'m fine baby.\" I pulled her in my lap swiftly as she yelped and then giggled. I smiled as I rubbed my nose in her neck. \" Dinner was amazing tonight baby. Thank you.\" \" Mmhmm you are more than welcome baby girl.\" I kissed her as she got up and walked to the kitchen we had in our room. I patted my pocket as I felt the ring. I shook my head as I knew the time was getting closer. \" Hey Tay…you want to go for a walk on the beach.\" Her eyes lit up with a smile and all I could do was smile back. \" Duh..lets go.\" I laughed as we grabbed our shoes and walked the short distance to the beach. I had made sure I got us a hotel on the beach just for this moment. We had been walking for about ten minutes and I was getting more nervous by the minute. All I could think about was how our relationship has progressed over the years. I knew it was now or never so I has stopped walking and she turned to look at me. \" Why\\'d you stop.\" I took a deep breath as I grabbed her hands and looked at her. \" You know I love you right?\" She nodded her head as she looked in my eyes. \"Tay you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I never knew that a girl would be able to affect my life so much. Every time I\\'m around you, you make things better. One look at you and my entire mood will change. I love the way you laugh, the way that you are so determined, the way that you always know what you want. I love the way your eyes shine when you\\'re excited about something. I love how even though I act like a kid sometime, you love me for who I am and have never made me change. My greatest mission in life is to make sure I treat you like the queen you are.\" At this point tears were running down her face. I took the ring out of my pocket and I watched as she gasp and placed her hand over her mouth. I looked into her eyes as I got down on one knee. \"Taylor Destiny McKessie, you are the woman for me and always have been. I want to spend the rest of my life repaying you for making me happy. So Taylor…will you marry me?\" My heart pounded as I watched her eyes water. I couldn\\'t hear anything but my heart. My hands were sweating as all I wanted to do was hear that one word. \" Yes!\" She jumped into my arms as we both fell back into the sand. I felt her kiss me hard as I finally came back to my senses. Pulling back I looked at her shocked. \" Yes?\" I repeated to her as she nodded her head with a laugh. \" Yes you lunkhead. Yes I will marry you.\" I smiled as I pulled her close to me to kiss her again. Pulling back I remembered the ring and I happily placed it on her finger. \" I love you.\" I told her as I pushed her hair out of her face. \" I love you too Chad.\" To think that nearly a year later we would be like this. A knock on my door broke my thoughts and I ran to the door to see both Aaron and Troy. \"Alright dude, what\\'s going on? Why did you have us rush over here?\" Troy asked as he sat on my couch. I didn\\'t say anything as I handed him the envelope. \"What\\'s this?\" I sighed as I went to grab a beer. \"The results.\" They both looked at each other before looking at me. \"What does it say?\" Aaron asked as I shrugged. \"Don\\'t know. I\\'m too fucking scared to open it.\" \"Dude, you need to do this. You\\'ve been nervous about this for the last two weeks.\" I looked at my best friend before shaking my head. \" I can\\'t. What if it says I\\'m the father?\" \"Then you do what you have to do. Chad I\\'m not speaking as the person who handles your business in the media, but as a friend. You can\\'t not know. This doesn\\'t just affect you but others as well. If the baby isn\\'t yours…great, if it is….you need to step up.\" I looked at Aaron before I took the envelope from Troy. I held it for five more minutes before handing it to Troy. \"I can\\'t read it. You do it.\" Troy nodded his head before grabbing the paper. It felt like hours with him opening it and reading it over. \"What does it say?\" I could feel the sweat beating down my forehead as my heart raced. \"Well Chad you….\" Taylor\\'s POV 3:45pm \"Tay are you sure you\\'re okay. I haven\\'t seen you in like 4 days.\" I rolled my eyes as I was the phone with Gabriella. The girls were constantly calling and checking up on me daily. \"El, I\\'m fine. I\\'ve just been taking some time. I figured this was perfect since we were off for the last couple of days.\" I heard her sigh through the phone as I walked towards my kitchen. I had found a nice apartment in the city, far enough away from Chad. He has been calling me damn near everyday, but I wasn\\'t ready to talk to him. I don\\'t think I ever will be. \"Yea I know, but that doesn\\'t mean I\\'m not worried about you.\" \"I know and I love you for being worried, but trust me I\\'m fine. The moment I\\'m not you will be the first to know.\" I heard a knock on my door which caused confusion. Only a few people knew where my new place was at. I looked the the peephole and behold Chad was standing on the other side. I sighed and touched the bridge of my nose. \"Gabriella, I\\'m going to have to call you back.\" Once we hung up I took a couple of deep breathes before opening the door. I saw Chad\\'s head spring up as if he was shocked that I answered the door. \"Hi.\" I rolled my eyes as I crossed my arms over my chest. \"What do you want Chad? Wait how the hell did you find out where I lived?\" \"Troy told me….can I come in? I really need to talk to you.\" I narrowed my eyes as Chad looked at me. \"Please Taylor…\" I sighed as I moved aside and let him in. I closed the door before walking into the living room with him following. We sat down on opposite ends of the couch. You could cut the tension with a knife. \"So…why are you here?\" Chad looked at me as if he was about to cry. I instantly felt my heart fall into my stomach. \"I..um…I got the results back.\" I stayed quiet as I looked at him. He was looking down at the floor, rubbing his hands together. \"I\\'m the father Tay.\" I closed my eyes as my heart…or what\\'s left of it broke in half. I didn\\'t even know I was crying until I felt the tears on my face. I shook my head back and forth as I got up and ran to the kitchen. I felt Chad behind me as I cried into my hands. Chad grabbed my hand and I jerked it back. \"No…don\\'t…don\\'t touch me.\" I leaned against the wall as Chad looked at me. \"Taylor..I\\'m sorry. I honestly thought it wasn\\'t mine.\" \"Well guess what it is Chad!\" He cringed as I yelled at him. I didn\\'t even know I was yelling but I was pissed. I was hurt. \"We we\\'re engaged Chad! We are supposed to be the ones having children!\" \"Taylor please..we can work on this. I love you! I want to be with you! We can handle this together, just me and you.\" I shook my head as the tears and angry wouldn\\'t stop. \"You don\\'t fucking get it do you. There is no more me and you. You got her pregnant Chad. She will always be in your life! You just think I\\'m still going to be with you when she will always have an advantage against me! She is having your baby! She just doesn\\'t go away after 18 years, you will always have a connection with her.\" He pulled me close into his arms and as much as I wanted to pull back I was too tired to do it. \"I\\'m sorry.\" I pushed him away from me as I shook my head. \"I\\'m tired of hearing I\\'m sorry. You\\'re an adult Chad! Start acting like it! You should know better than this. You know what just leave.\" \"Tay…\" \"Leave!\" I yelled as I pointed towards the door. Chad looked at me with his eyes full of tears before walking out of the door. I slide down the wall as I placed my face in my hands and cried. Bolton Residence 11:22pm Troys POV \"So I was thinking we could have Kaylee\\'s birthday party with our family and friends on Sunday and then since we both have an off day that Monday, we could have a family day. Maybe take her to Sea World.\" My wife told me as we were laying in the bed talking. Well she was talking. I was too busy trying to make a hickey on her neck. \"Mmmm sounds great baby.\" I continued kissing and sucking on her neck as I rubbed her thigh. \"Troy are you even listening to me?\" I pulled back to see her face and all I could do was give her a small smile. \"Of course I am baby but honestly I think you are thinking about the wrong things at this time of night.\" She shook her head as she pushed me off her but I pulled her back. \"We need to start planning her party Troy.\" \"We have two months left. We have time.\" I moved her hair out of her neck as I found the spot I was looking for again. I heard her sigh as I smirked because I knew I was getting somewhere. \"Is sex all you ever think about?\" I laughed as I pulled back to look at her. \"Of course not. But it is number 3. Right behind my two favorite girls.\" I laughed again as she hit my chest. \"Honestly baby. I just think we need to work on baby #2.\" I said as she smirked down at me. \"Baby #2 huh…\" I nodded my head as I flipped us over so I was on top. \"Yup. I mean Kaylee will be four so it\\'s the perfect time for her to have a sibling. James and I are four year apart after all\" I gave my award winning smile as she just shook her head. \"You just want a boy.\" I only rolled my eyes as I kissed her lips before moving down to her neck again. It was just something about her neck that I couldn\\'t get enough of. \"That is not true.\" She giggled as she rubbed her hands through my hair. \"I don\\'t think Tony would be happy about the fact that you got me pregnant right behind Alex and Shar being pregnant. We already have to wait to do any videos.\" \"Eh he\\'ll be okay. Now hush and let me ravish you.\" She laughed as I attacked her lips again. She rubbed her hands down my abs which she knew turned me on. She flipped us over and I smirked as I watched her pull my shirt over her head. I rubbed my hands all over her body as our bodies blended into each other. Our mood was broken when her cell phone rang. I groaned as Gabriella tried to pull back but I pulled her closer. \"Don\\'t answer it.\" I mumbled into her lips as I pulled her closer to me. I started kissing down her neck when the phone rang again. I heard her sigh as she turned to grab her phone. \"Whoever this it, it better be important.\" I chuckled as I found her favorite spot again and sucked on it. \"Oh my God Tay are you okay?\" My eyes popped opened as I groaned. I already knew where this was headed. \"Okay I will be over in ten minutes.\" My head snapped up from her neck as she hung up the phone. \"Um excuse me where do you think you are going?\" Gabriella looked up at me as she rolled her eyes. \"My best friend is in tears because her ex-fiancé, who also happens to be your best friend, cheated on her and you want to have sex.\" I looked at her and she just shook her head. She pushed me off of her before going into the bathroom. I groaned as I placed my arm over my eyes. I was going to fucking kill Chad. July 7 12:35pm Chads POV I groaned as the banging on my door was getting louder and louder. I rolled over as I looked at my phone to see it was after 12pm. I had a massive hangover. After got home from Taylor\\'s I got drunk until I passed out. I got up and answered the door to see my best friend on the other side glaring at me. \"What the fu…\" I looked down to see he had Kaylee with him. \"What the fudge do you want.\" Troy rolled his eyes as he pushed past me and walked into my apartment. He looked around my apartment to see all the liquor bottles before shaking his head. \"Hey baby girl, do you want to go watch Lion King in Uncle Chads room.\" Kaylee nodded her head as we both went in my room to set the movie up before walking into the living room. \"So I\\'m guessing you told Taylor about the baby.\" I rolled my eyes as I went to go grab a glass and the whiskey that was sitting on table. \"What gave you that clue?\" \"Maybe the fact that she called Ella last night in tears or the fact that you are drowning yourself in liquor.\" He snatched the bottle out of my hand as I groaned. \"What the hell am I supposed to do Troy?! I\\'ve never seen Taylor so hurt before. After I told her she basically broke down in tears. I legit wanted to kick my own ass.\" I laid my head on the table as I felt the tears in my eyes. \"I hate to say it Chad but as your best friend I have to say this. You brought this on yourself.\" My head popped up as I glared at him. He held his hands up defensively as he shook his head. \"I\\'m sorry dude but come on we\\'re pro basketball players. You know we have women all over the US that want to hook up with us. They don\\'t care if we are in relationships. It\\'s been that way since we first got drafted. I get it we do dumb shit when we are angry but you crossed the line. Anytime Ella and I get into an argument, I always make sure I fix it before one of us leave the city for work. If I\\'m going to play a game or she has to go for a performance I\\'m not walking away angry. Anything can happen to one of us and I don\\'t want that to be the last memory of us.\" I sighed as I knew he was right. I did bring this on myself. \"Plus… you have a child on the way. That child is your number one priority at the moment. I would do anything for Kaylee. That\\'s another reason why I make sure that Ella and I are okay. You know I love Gabriella more than anything in the world and the same goes for Kaylee. What we do reflects her. I don\\'t want her to get older and see anything negative about her parents. I know you love Taylor but right now you need to focus on your baby. I\\'m not saying you have to be in a relationship with Jessica, but you at least need to work together to co-parents.\" I rubbed my face as I nodded my head. Troy was right. As much as I wanted Taylor back in my life I had to handle this first. 4:45pm I sat in my car as I stared at the house in front of me. I shook my head as I couldn\\'t believe I was about to do this. I took a deep breathe as I tried to remember what Troy told me. I walked up to the door and knocked and two seconds later she opened the door. \"What are you doing here?\" I stared at Jessica as I had to remember I was doing this for my baby. \"We need to talk. Can I come in.\" She nodded her head before she stepped aside. We walked into her living room as we sat on her couch. I looked at her as I noticed how she didn\\'t even look almost four months pregnant. \"So what do you want to talk about.\" \"I took the test Jessica. I know I\\'m the father.\" She rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \"Well duh.\" I took a deep breathe as I tried not to snap. \"Look I\\'m just came to tell you that I\\'m not walking away from this. We did this together and I\\'m not letting you go through this alone. I wasn\\'t raised that way. I will be there for my child but I need for you to understand where we stand. I don\\'t want a relationship with you. I still love Taylor and I will get her back. My child comes first now but our relationship is only about our child.\" I watched her soak all of this in as she nodded her head. \"Okay. To be honest Chad I never wanted this either. This was a mistake but I\\'m not going to let my child grow up unloved.\" \"And he or she won\\'t.\" Jessica sighed as she rubbed her belly. \"Thank you. We can work out the details of how we are going to do this later but thanks for taking the test and stepping up.\" I nodded my head as it was quiet for a moment. \"Do you want to feel the baby. It has been kicking a lot today.\" I looked up at her before getting up and sitting by her. She took my hand and placed it on the side of her stomach. As soon as my hand touched her stomach, I felt a strong kick. \"Wow…\" I stared down at her stomach as the baby kept doing it. I couldn\\'t believe it. This was my baby. \"They get stronger everyday. Might be a soccer player in there.\" I laughed as I shook my head before looking at her. \"Nah us Danforths don\\'t do soccer. Basketball, track, baseball but that\\'s about it.\" She laughed before placing her hand on top of mine. \"Like I said this means a lot Chad. I lost my parents when I was 17 and I\\'m an only child. I didn\\'t want to do this alone.\" I rubbed her belly before rubbing her hands. \"And you won\\'t have to.\" July 15 Taylor\\'s POV \"Taylor, where\\'s your ring?!\" \"Taylor, how are you and Chad?\" \"Hey Taylor, are the rumors true that Chad got that model pregnant?\" I bit my lip and kept my head down as I walked into the studio. I hated the media. They always wanted a new story. Word got out about Chad and I\\'s situation and they have been a pain in my ass ever since. I shook my head as I finally reached the inside of the studio. I was meeting with the girls today for us to record some new music. I hadn\\'t seen them in a while and I missed them all like crazy. We would talk on the phone or FaceTime but that\\'s about it. The only one I\\'ve really been seeing is Gabriella. She even helped me write a new song. We did a cover of it for the rest of the girls and they loved it. Walking into the room, I let off a small smile as I saw them. Sharpay and Alexandra were huge and both were rubbing their stomach. Kelsi was the first to see me and jumped up to come hug me. \"Oh my god Taylor. I missed you so much.\" I laughed as I hugged her back. \"I miss you too Kelsi.\" I went over to hug the rest of the girls before I sat down at the table with them. \"How have you been?\" Alex asked as I shrugged. \"I\\'ve been better. Well not really. I think it\\'s getting worse because the media knows or at least they have an idea.\" \"Have you talked to Chad.\" I shook my head as I sighed. \"No and he\\'s even texting me non stop. I just…I can\\'t deal with him right now.\" Gabriella rubbed my back as I gave them all a small smile. \"Well I for one think he is an asshole and if I wasn\\'t pregnant and always tired I would kick his ass for you.\" Sharpay said as we all laughed. \"Thanks Shar but I don\\'t need you going into labor this early. Zeke would kill Chad.\" I looked at them all before rubbing my face. I knew this was hard on all of our friends because we were so close. \"I don\\'t want you all to feel like you have to choose sides. I know Chad is like a brother to you all.\" \"Tay we aren\\'t choosing sides. Yes Chad was an idiot for what he did but we are here for the both of you. I\\'m just sorry because like you said he\\'s like a brother to us and he\\'s our husbands friend. He\\'s going to be around but so will we. We got your back.\" I smiled as I hugged them all. I loved these girls so much and even though I felt like I was alone, I knew I had them to help me ever step of the way. \"Okay enough of all of this sad stuff. Let\\'s start recording these songs before Tony flips his lid or before one of these twins uses my bladder as a trampoline.\" I laughed as Alex hopped up from her seat and we all followed her. We definitely were on a time frame between these three babies and our manger. I may have been going through a lot right now but I knew between my job and my friends I was going to be able to put Chad, our relationship and this baby to the back of my mind….at least I was going to try to. Another chapter finally out! Chad is the father! I\\'m sorry for those who didn\\'t want him to be the father but just stick with me okay. Don\\'t you just love Troy!

She had to make him understand her. \"I understand, Gabriella, but why...\" Troy Bolten trailed off, deep blue eyes searching dark wavery ones for an answer \"... I don\\'t understand why that would involve us... separating.\" His deep voice broke on that word, and a single tear made its way down his contorted face. She took a moment to take a closer look into his shining eyes, looking for an answer that would explain the web of tangled emotions she felt within her. There was an answer, but none of her answers felt right. \"Troy...\" she began to back away, his arms slipping from her waist. It felt like a brick hit her in her stomach. \"Why?\" His voice sounded broken, hurt. It was ripping at both of their hearts. \"This means so much to me... the collage is giving me one final chance... and I have to take it.\" Her voice wavered. \"And I can\\'t have both of you in my life at a time. The offer... It is a second chance, for one time only... and you-\" tears choked her. \"What is it, Gabriella?\" He slipped closer to her again, pulling her in tight, taking a whiff of her hair. \"Why?\" He whispered the last part, holding onto his emotions barely. \"I have a chance with you, and it will stand for a while.\" Her arms wrapped around his, clutching him. His familiar smell enveloped her comfortably. She took as much in as she could before she left. \"You\\'re right. I will wait for you.\" Suddenly, with much hope, he pulled back, taking in her breathtaking face. He\\'ll miss her big brown eyes, the contours of her face, luscious lips. He still had a chance with her. It didn\\'t help much to his fearful heart. \"Promise me something, Gabriella Montez.\" He held her tighter, gaze more intense. Her heart skipped a beat. She would do anything for him. \"Yes?\" \"I will wait for you, if you wait for me.\" His voice rose with the passion he felt in every particle in his being. \"Always.\" She breathed. Hope rested within her. With that, he brought her closer, lips crashing against lips. Sealed within this embrace was the mark of their promise. Though the promise was made, it didn\\'t stop him from worrying about obstacles that could change them. Only time would tell. Pulling back, he looked at her with fire in his eyes. \"I love you, I always will.\" \"I love you right back, Troy. Always.\" She replied, pulling back. Tears fell harder. \"I have to go.\" He let her go hesitantly. She would take half his heart with her. He hoped she would keep it safe. \"Bye.\" With that, she ran to her car. She didn\\'t want to look back in fear of changing her mind.'][Chapter 2] [\"Chapter 2 Troy could not believe it had been eight years since him and Gabriella had see each other. Troy was glad that he never got with any other girl and stayed faithful to Gabriella. Troy had decided that when he sees Gabriella that he was going to propose to her.

Gabriella told her boyfriend that she was going to go to the bathroom. So Gabriella went to the bathroom. Troy decided he would propose to his girlfriend under the stars. So the waitress brought the bill and sat it down on the table. Troy went to pay the bill. Gabriella came out of the bathroom and saw her boyfriend paying the bill. She went over to Troy and laid her head on his shoulder. Troy got the bill paid and they left the restraint. They went to the car and got in to it. They pulled out of the parking lot and were now on the way to the park. A few minutes later they arrived at the park and parked the car. They got out of the car and locked it up. Gabriella asked her boyfriend why they were at the park for. Troy told his girlfriend that she would find out soon enough. Gabriella saw her boyfriend carrying a blanket. They walk to a spot where they could see the stars. Troy spread the blanket out on the ground and they sat down on it. Gabriella looked over at her boyfriend and saw that he was getting nervous.

Go back and read Coach\\'s Daughter before diving into the sequel! Thank you! ENJOY! Chapter 1 – Shock Prologue Monday, April 6 th , 2020 NCAA Men\\'s Championship Duke vs. Michigan Gabi\\'s POV My eyes watched Troy stretch across the court with his hands open for the ball as Brady tossed him the ball. He was quick around the Michigan player before going in to score to pull Duke ahead. The Michigan coach called timeout as Troy yelled with victory as they came together for a timeout. Troy pulled his jersey up to wipe away the sweat from his face as he was beaming but his face grew serious as my dad was drawing up plays. My eyes were excited watching him as finally getting to the championship game his senior year. Lauren stood on one side of me while Sam and Jessie on the other side of me. Audrey and Jake were both standing on down the row as we watched a person, we all loved, do what he loved. Lauren squeezed my hand as Grey and Troy took the court together after the time out with only thirty seconds left of the game. Duke was leading by two as Michigan had the ball. Troy and Grey pressed with defense together from the top as Michigan tried to pass the ball down the court but Duke put on a good defensive show. My eyes watched the clock tick down to twenty seconds when Michigan threw the shot in the air. I gasped and held my breath as my eyes grew wide as everybody stood still as it bounced on the rim before bouncing out. Troy leaped into the air as he grabbed the ball for the board. He quickly pushed the ball down the court and away from Michigan as I felt it in my chest and excitement erupted throughout my entire body. The buzzer sounded, and I felt a scream of excitement leave my mouth as I watched the Duke basketball team mob the center of the court while blue confetti drained from the ceiling. Troy tilted his head back with a scream of enjoyment escaping his mouth. Chills ran over my body at how incredible he was and how much I wanted him. We were quickly ushered to the court as I watched from the sidelines of Troy pulling on the championship shirt with a hat as he was hugging all of his teammates. I saw him hugging my dad and I couldn\\'t stop my grin as my dad said something to him before Troy let out a laugh. I smiled watching him greet and hug everybody around him. His eyes finally started to roam the court and I grinned as our eyes met. He grinned from ear to ear as I quickly ran across the court before he wrapped his arms around me. \" Congrats baby, I am so proud of you,\" I whispered into his ear as I hugged him tightly while my legs wrapped around his waist. He laughed, and I pulled back as our lips locked in the middle of the court. \"I\\'m just happy that you are here. I was scared you weren\\'t going to make it.\" I titled my forehead to meet his as I shook my head, \"Never baby, absolutely never.\" He smiled as he kissed me softly again before he set me back down on the ground. He hugged his parents and his siblings as my dad pulled me into a hug. They started the trophy presentation and began to cut down the nets. The whole process took too long before the party began to end. The boys were all smiling and laughing. Everybody was happy and excited. They worked hard for this and I was proud of all of them. Troy and I took a picture together with the trophy and I repeated the process with my dad. We took a big group picture and then just one of Troy with the trophy. Once the madness began to die down, I felt his hand creep around my body as he pulled me back against him. \"Come here,\" he whispered into my ear as he dragged me around the corner and I laughed, \"Where are we going?\" he looked over his shoulder with a mischievous smile crossing his face. He pushed through an empty door before he had me pinned against it. I felt my lower body grow weak with his lips attacking mine. His warm mouth all over mine and I inhaled through my teeth with a gasp. Yes, everything was right in this world. Absolutely everything. Monday, November 2 nd , 2020 Troy\\'s POV I scrubbed my hand over my face as I loosened the tie around my neck while slid in the back door that only players knew about into Duke\\'s basketball arena. I slipped through the back and up into the bleachers as my eyes roamed until I landed on Eli Montez who was sitting with his wife. Trevor and Vivian were right next with an almost three-year-old Wyatt. Vivian had a noticeable bump, but she wasn\\'t very far along. Gabi was so excited when Trevor told her she was going to be an aunt again. I turned my head as I saw Coach Montez turn and scan the crowd. I avoided their section before ducking to my normal seat. My eyes found her on the court as she was in her warm-ups still. Her shorts were the only thing on her that I noticed. The white with blue trim that I had worn myself last year. The blue devil in the corner. Her blue pullover was hiding her jersey with a pair of white Nike shoes and blue socks. Her calves were toned and tight from her constant working in the gym. The constant need to be the best and to make a name for herself in the basketball community. If she wasn\\'t at the gym, she was studying or in class. Gabi pushed herself constantly and I knew it was just who she was but these past few months she pushed harder and harder than I was comfortable with. She was successfully admitted into Duke\\'s Medical School. She was happy to be taking all of her medical school classes along with being a basketball player, but it left her very little time with other things in life. Not that she was happy with me anyways. My hands rubbed on my slacks from a long day of work, but my eyes found her again. The messy bun on the top of her head with the white Nike band in her hair pushing back those curly strands. Her eyes did a scan of the crowd as she smiled at her parents but when her eyes flickered to this seat, she frowned. Sadness was constantly filled in her eyes and I didn\\'t know why she was constantly pushing me away. Pushing me to the point that I was so close to just giving up with her. I was fighting so hard for her. So hard. Those brown eyes connected with mine and my pleading blue eyes went back to her. It wasn\\'t that I was desperate for her to come back to my life in a regular fashion. I just wanted her to claim me again. She hadn\\'t stopped showing up at night and ending up in my bed. She hadn\\'t stopped texting me when she had a bad day. She still acted as if we were in a relationship but when we were in public and during the daylight hours: she kept her front tight of being really mad at me. Yet, the moment the moon came out she was lonely and wanted some sort of attention. I had to wait until almost one in the morning until she would come around, but she always did. Gabi only shook her head before taking the ball and making the next four shots in a row without flinching. I sighed leaning back in the chair when the seat next to me plopped out. \"You look like you\\'ve had a day,\" I grunted at Grey\\'s assessment of the situation. \"Coach\\'s practices were easier than today.\" I mumbled as I pulled at the ends of my hair as Grey sighed. \"Is she still mad at you?\" I nodded as the anger had been there since we graduated last May. It hadn\\'t really set in until August of this year, but her anger was relentless. \"Yup,\" my lips popped around the P as I laughed in my seat, \"Is she still showing up at night?\" I rolled my lips together as I nodded, \"Once or twice a week. If she doesn\\'t show up, she\\'ll send me a text. I think at night she realizes that I\\'m still here. That I still want her. Yet, during the day she can\\'t let go of her anger.\" Grey looked at Gabi as she had stripped her warm-up shirt and was only wearing her jersey. Damn, she was so fucking sexy. So beautiful. She was still mine. \"I just think you\\'re going to have to ride the wave,\" Grey said patting my back and I rolled my own eyes at his saying. \"How was work though? Still loving it?\" I nodded my head as I looked over at him. Grey hadn\\'t aged too much in the last two and a half years, but he was older. He grew out his facial hair more often and his hair was more of a clean-cut. \"Is Lauren making it tonight?\" I asked, and Grey grunted himself as they had been a bit rocky themselves. \"I think so. She\\'s trying to get out of work on time to be here by the second quarter but…\" Lauren had chosen to become a high school teacher at a local school that she did her student teaching. Yet, she was constantly working late to make sure everything was properly set up, lesson plans were made, and that the next day would go smoothly. She worked late frequently, which is what caused a tiff between the two lovers not that long ago. Damn, what I would give to have that tiff with Gabi. \"How was your job today?\" I asked, and he shrugged as he brushed his fingers through his hair. The whistles blew, and my attention was full of Gabi as she was a starter. She stood back from the center paint as she had become a force to be reckoned with on the court. She was full of ESPN most times after games and was the constant talk. She led them to a final four last year in March Madness, but we took it all. I was just glad she was able to be at our championship game. Before everything turned to shit. \"Job…the job was okay. I need to get into grad school so that I can become an athletic trainer. I am sick of shadowing and constantly not getting paid.\" I bit on my lip as I looked over at him, \"I enrolled for my master\\'s program in the spring.\" I said stretching my legs out and he swung his eyes towards me a little surprised. \"I ended up doing the Syracuse online program. I\\'ll start in January and should be done with it next January. I hope if I tell her that I am doing that then she\\'ll fucking relax and just let us happen.\" Grey sighed as he leaned back while we both just watched Gabi on the court. Her movement was effortless, and I could only think about how much I love her. She has been a constant person in my life for the past three years. In my eyes, we were still together. In her eyes, we weren\\'t together. The facts were fuzzy, and people were angry, she was angry. Biting down on my lip Gabi stumbled for the ball but she recovered easily but I still couldn\\'t breathe. \"How was the Durham Bulls today?\" I sighed as I leaned back, \"Off season is really boring.\" I said with a roll of my eyes and he laughed, \"No scandals to take care of yet?\" I laughed shaking my head, \"No. Nothing of that nature yet.\" I picked at my pants as I had taken a job with a minor league baseball team with their public relation department. I was an assistant for now with the head director, but I was doing a lot of hands on things and working hard. We were working on next season promotions and how to spread awareness of the team. During next season, I would help with game day operations and coordinating interviews. It was a great starting out the job and I was making decent money for doing it. It may have not been my first choice, but it was the job closest to Gabi. I was hired on in May right after graduation and I fucking loved season. I traveled with the team, I helped make press releases and got to know the players. It was a lot of fun. Gabi had yet to miss a shot tonight and I felt a pair of eyes on me. I couldn\\'t help but look and Trevor glanced over at me. He stood up whispering something to Viv and I sighed before pushing out of my seat, \"I\\'ll be right back.\" Grey turned to see Trevor and he nodded as I went back a few rows where Trevor met me. \"Hey,\" he said, and I nodded as I rubbed my hands together. \"You know I\\'m team Troy, right?\" I laughed and nodded, \"Yea, I just…fuck, I don\\'t know man. I just wish she would let me make my life choices.\" Trevor watched his sister and he sighed. \"I think she just doesn\\'t want to hold you back.\" \"She\\'s not,\" I said with gritted teeth, \"I wish she would understand that.\" The frustration laced through my voice. Trevor patted my back, \"Just keep trying. You look exhausted.\" I grumbled, \"She calls me at one in the morning. She comes over to my apartment.\" Trevor held his hands out and I shook my head, \"No, it\\'s okay, I get it. She still wants to be with you.\" I nodded my head as I scrubbed my five o\\'clock shadow on my face with my hands. \"Yes, and I am not denying that. I love those late nights with her because she is a normal Gabi. She isn\\'t mad at me. We just don\\'t talk about it. Something about the daylight that brings it all out.\" He patted my back, \"She\\'ll understand eventually, obviously, you aren\\'t giving up.\" I shook my head, \"She\\'s mine,\" I mumbled, \"She\\'s always been mine.\" Trevor nodded his head and we both watched her play. The score being run up with the early season game. I was excited to be able to watch an entire season of hers. I was so excited. We barely ever got to watch each other when we were both playing, and the times were so fucking hard to be with each other, but we did it. \"Wy has been asking for you,\" I smiled and looked over at the family that had adopted me. \"Yea, I miss that little dude.\" Trevor rubbed my shoulder, \"She\\'ll come around. Just keeping talking to her.\" I nodded as he got up to leave and I sighed as the buzzer winded down to half time. I hung my head and rubbed my face with both hands just trying to understand what I was supposed to do next. I moved back down and sat next to Grey. \"We\\'ll get through to her,\" Grey said as I just nodded looking up at the half time show. \"Yea,\" I finally whispered because I wasn\\'t sure what I could believe anymore. I leaned back against the wall as I waited for her locker room door to open and for her to come out. The girls who recognized me smiled and nodded and when the door opened again, and my hair rose on my arms and I smelled her body scent that I know so fucking well, I pushed off the wall. My eyes peered up at her in a pair of sweats and a t-shirt. Her hair wet and laying down her back. I inhaled with uncertainty and her lips turned upside down. I was so distracted by her smell that I couldn\\'t form words. Our eyes locked together, and she shook her head trying to move past me. \"B, please,\" I whispered, and she winced at my nickname for her and she crossed her arms. Her body language is so stiff. I don\\'t remember when things changed this badly between us but I hated it. I didn\\'t want this anymore. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked, I fucking laughed and I ran my hand through my hair. My hands running down my face as I looked at her. She was biting her lower lip and she shook her head back and forth at my reaction. \"What am I doing here,\" I muttered her phrase a few different times while I closed my eyes tightly. \"As if my love for you just disappears.\" I snap my fingers and she shifted uncomfortably. \"I have never been able to just come to watch a game without having to sacrifice a thousand other things. It was always the plan to just watch you this season. To enjoy you. Then you are asking what the fuck I am doing here.\" I couldn\\'t stop my laugh again and I just rubbed my face. \"I know it doesn\\'t, I know.\" She breathed, and I just shook my head. \"Do you?\" the question fell dead between us as our eyes were locked on each other. \"Why won\\'t you just let us happen again?\" I asked stubbornly, and she huffed with her eyes turning away from me. \"I don\\'t want to be with somebody who doesn\\'t chase what he should be chasing.\" I rolled my eyes at her comment and tugged on my hair. \"Jesus, Gabi, you act as if I turned down a dream job and took a shitty job just to be near you and you know damn well that isn\\'t the case.\" Gabi rolled her lips together and she shook her head, \"I don\\'t have time for this tonight.\" She mumbled and tried to walk away. I pulled on her arm and she looked at me, her eyes moving down to my hand on her skin. The burn between our bodies was still so strong that I struggled to not just press her back against the wall. \"Please, Troy,\" I hesitated at her words as I had so many words myself to say but, I let her go and she walked away from me. I let my head fall back and I shook it back and forth with frustration. I pulled out my car keys and went to my car. I got inside, and I slammed my hand down several times into the steering wheel. Tears rushing my eyes and my chest welling with pressure. I was so fucking angry. I just wanted her in my life, every single day. She wasn\\'t living in dorms anymore or student apartments. She was supposed to want to live with me. Taking another step in our relationship. Instead, she freaked out. I continued to watch the lights as I passed through them and drove my car around Durham, North Carolina. Gabi and I worked hard to keep our relationship steady with her class load plus basketball. I had basketball plus work it had caused not a lot of time for the two of us. Yet, it worked. We made time for each other. I would help her study, or she would come to sit at Rents. We would go to as many basketball games of each other as possible. If we were home and they were home and if neither of us had something else conflicting: we supported each other. Always. The more I dove into public relations with sports the more I was interested. I constantly was working with Duke\\'s PR guy and it made me happy. I loved learning and using social media to our advantage. I loved constantly getting to work with the press and being a communicator with the team. It was something I really enjoyed. Gabi knew I enjoyed it too, which is what caused our greatest down fall. She was constantly thinking that I turned down a job in Seattle with a triple-a baseball team. Gabi thought it was perfect for me because I would be close to family and it was a really good stepping stone to the major leagues public relations. I also received a job offer in Chicago and Georgia for different minor sports teams to get a footing before being promoted. They were decent jobs and they did catch my attention, but she wasn\\'t going to be there. She would never be there. Gabi was stuck in Durham until at least 2024 and then she would match for her residency somewhere in the world. Why would I want a job that would chain me somewhere else? I would get a really good experience here and then move onto another job. Gabi never understood it and we fought endlessly all summer long. She refused to be a part of something that I would regret later and tried to break up with me in August. She was struggling with it all summer and we had fought and fought with it. When I moved into my apartment, the very first night after she tried to break up with me. She had sent me a text from the bar and asked for my address. She wanted to come over and see me. Thus, started the hot and cold game we had been playing. At night, she was all mine. She loved me. Wanted me. Yet, she was always gone in the morning and if I tried to contact her, she would freak out. It was causing me whiplash from her constant tugging of needing me and hating me. I wasn\\'t even sure if she hated me. She just was disappointed with the choice that I made. My palm rubbed my chin as I continued to drive around the city, constantly going in circles. I continued to drive around aimlessly before I found my way to my apartment. It wasn\\'t too far from campus so that I was still close to Gabi during school hours and basketball games. It was a nice place with one bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen with a large open living room. My balcony had two chairs and a small table. It had become my bachelor pad, but I would fucking love for Gabi to just make it a home for the both of us. Grey had an apartment in this building as well, but Lauren lived with him. Their apartment had character. I turned my car off and I sat there for a minute as my eyes flickered to the clock to see it was almost midnight. My phone buzzed in the cupholder and I knew exactly what this text read before I picked my phone up. Gabi: Can I come over? I miss you. I wanted to say no. Badly, I so badly just wanted to tell her to fuck off, but I physically and mentally couldn\\'t ever tell her that. I couldn\\'t in my life tell her that because I always wanted her coming to me. I exhaled as I just sent back and okay before I moved inside my apartment. I dropped my backpack with my day\\'s work and reached for the glasses and the Crown Royal sitting on my counter. I filled my glass fuller than it should be as I took off my tie. I slung it on the chair as I settled on the stool sipping my drink. There was a soft knock on the door and then she slipped in. She was in a pair of leggings with a t-shirt, her hair braided back. The girl I fell in love with, but she wasn\\'t there. She was a ghost of herself. The smile couldn\\'t reach her eyes, and something happened. I didn\\'t know what happened, but I just wish she would talk to me. I wasn\\'t sure if her anger anymore had something to do with my job but something that caused this shift of mood towards me. Her eyes were focused on the floor as she kicked off her shoes and dropped her bag onto the ground. The sound it made was louder than most sounds in this apartment because of her large books that her face was constantly stuck in. \"Hey,\" she said, and I didn\\'t say anything. Her eyes quickly looked up at me and I swallowed on the alcohol. Praying it hit my system faster. \"Troy,\" she said my name causing goosebumps to travel down my back and I gripped my glass tighter. \"Gabi, I can\\'t fucking play this game anymore.\" I looked up at her and she seemed surprised, she shook her head, \"No. This isn\\'t the deal. I come over here, we go in there, I leave before you wake up.\" I sucked in a dry laugh and I shook my head. \"No. I\\'m over it. I love fucking having you in my bed, but I can\\'t do it anymore. I love you, Gabi. I love you so fucking hard and you are pushing me away because of what? I took a job that I thought was the best fit for me? I don\\'t want to be in Seattle. I don\\'t want to be in Chicago. I don\\'t want to be in Atlanta. I want to be right fucking here in Durham where the love of my fucking life is.\" Gabi\\'s brown eyes were wide, and I finished off my whiskey before I poured another glass. \"I love my job. I love this city. I love you.\" My eyes pierced hers and she sucked in on her bottom lip. I only wanted that lip in my mouth. So badly. I wanted her pinned in my bed. I wanted her in every single capacity. \"I love that you still want to come to me even though you broke up with me, but I can\\'t do this anymore. You are fucking with my head every single time you walk through that door.\" Gabi released a really heavy sigh and she walked to my cabinet and found herself a glass. She stole the Crown Royal in front of me and poured some into her own glass. She took a long drink. \"I love you,\" she finally mustered, and my chest relaxed, and I closed my eyes at her words. She has said them to me a few different times but never before we had sex and called it a night. \"I love you so much Troy, I hate that you wouldn\\'t branch out because of me though. I blame myself. I…\" I shook my head as I walked away. My hands sitting on the top of my head. \"Why the fuck are you blaming yourself?\" I turned to look at her and she bit her lip. Those brown eyes filling with tears, \"I made this choice.\" I said loudly as I tapped my chest with my flat palm. \"I made it. I looked at all of these places and let me fucking tell you. I would have made less money in Seattle. In Chicago, I would have been an intern and at the bottom of the food chain. In Atlanta, it was the same exact fucking job I have right fucking now.\" My voice rose with every single syllable. \"But I have told you all of this Gabi, a thousand times. I have constantly told you over and over again that out of all of these job offers. Durham was the best one for me. It was the job I was looking for and guess what Gabi?\" She didn\\'t say anything and only gave me a deer in the headlights look. I never rose my voice before when we had these conversations. I never lost my cool. I just had explained it a thousand times to her why I had made my decision. We stopped talking about it in August though. When she finally tried to pull away and started just talking to me at night was when we just used each other. I ran my hands through my hair and my palms down my face as I laughed. I was so tired of having this fight with her. \"You\\'re in Durham, Gabi. You. You are not in Chicago. You are not in Atlanta. You are not in Seattle. You are not at any of those fucking places so tell me why I would choose them?\" Gabi bit down hard on her lip as she looked down at her feet, her hands ringing each other terrified of something. \"You were basically promised a job in the majors with the Seattle job, which is near your family!\" she said finally meeting my eye and I shook my head. \"I would still be almost four hours away from my family. They actually told me to take the Durham position. They told me that it was a better fit for who I was. I am actually saving money here. I would be scraping for pennies in Seattle. Oh, and guess what Gabi? My family thought I would be stupid to not take this position because of you!\" Gabi rubbed her face with her hands before she went and collapsed in my couch. Her body language was defeated and exhausted. She looked, how I felt. Completely defeated with the situation. \"I just don\\'t know where I will be in three years, Troy.\" I went over, and I collapsed down next to her myself as I let my elbows rest on my knees. \"You don\\'t think I don\\'t know that Gabi?\" her eyes moved to mine and she gripped her glass tighter. \"I would happily move to another location. I am getting experience and I am getting to learn how it works and during your residency maybe I go for a bigger job? I don\\'t know. It\\'ll depend on where we land. It doesn\\'t matter to me though, Gabi because I will still be doing the same job just with a different team. I love it. I love that I will get to change and try something new.\" I paused as I exhaled draining the rest of my second glass. \"I would never have settled for this job if I didn\\'t think it was a good fit for me. I was looking at places about two to three hours from here as well. This was just the one that was right for me. The one I thought would best fit all of my needs. Yes, of course, you were a factor. You will always be a factor in my decision.\" I whispered towards her as she rubbed her face as the tears were only falling faster. \"How can you not hate me?\" she whispered, \"I just keep pushing you away because I know you have dreams, Troy.\" I let out a laugh and shook my head as I gently reached over to place my hand on her knee. My eyes locked in on it as I let my thumb trace over and over again. \"I could never hate you. I am just so fucking sick of having this conversation with you. I am sick of trying to prove to you that you are what matters to me. The same job in a different city doesn\\'t even put a blimp on where you are in my life. It was supposed to be our apartment. It was supposed to be my year of just getting to watch you, ball out on that court.\" My hands gently pulled her closer to me and my nose pressed into her neck. \"I have dreams, yes, of course, but I\\'m 22. I have so much time for my dreams and you\\'re chasing your dreams still. I want to watch you chase them and do them. I told you and have told you over and over and over again that I am in your corner. That I am and always will be in your corner. You are my girl. The love of my life. The one I need but I can\\'t let you keep pushing me away. My heart can\\'t handle watching you get up in the morning and leave without even a word. If I text you, you yell at me.\" \"I\\'m sorry, I just…\" I quickly moved away, and I shook my head, \"No. I just…if that is how this conversation is going to go then just leave. I don\\'t want to listen to you tell me over and over again that you are afraid I\\'ll hate you later. I don\\'t want to listen to you tell me that I am making a big mistake. Unless there is something else going on that you just will not tell me then please just leave because I am so over all of this. I am so over us arguing because I want my memories of you good ones. You are the best spot in my life and if you are just done with it. Stop texting me. Stop coming over. Stop telling me you love me.\" My breathing was rapid and my chest rising heavily. The pain rapidly filling my chest of her leaving me. A sob broke free from her mouth and my chest cracked. I looked at her and all I saw was a girl who was broken. I never thought in a million years that me staying behind and being with her was going to cause this. I never wanted to cause this heartbroken girl across from me. She stood up, but she didn\\'t move for the door, she only moved towards me. Her hands rested on my chest and she tilted her head back. Those brown eyes were sad and if I was at Rents I would order her a caramel latte that would help soothe her restlessness in those eyes. The trapped sadness. \"If I tell you something, you\\'re going to finally hate me. I was hoping that if I just made you hate me another way then you would leave. That I could forget you, but you have dug your heels into the ground and you refuse to hate me. You refuse to just leave and do what is best for you and that isn\\'t me. I am not good enough for you. You deserve so much better and the fact that you took a job in Durham from me. It broke my heart because I don\\'t deserve you.\" She said, and I grabbed her hand and held it close to me. I hated how this conversation was going but I kept my mouth shut. Her brown eyes were so fucking sad, and they had been for quite some time. \"You are going to hear nothing I have to say after I say what I need to say but I am so sorry, Troy. I never wanted to tell you. I never wanted this to happen.\" She choked back another sob and she closed her eyes painfully. A cracked sob echoed from her mouth, \"I need you to understand that I love you and that I hate how I\\'ve treated you these past several months,\" my mind was racing with the worst of news as I stared at her desperately looking for answers. \"Just tell me,\" I begged her, and she inhaled sharply as she looked up at me. My heart was racing because I didn\\'t know what was happening. I don\\'t know when this happened or why it happened. I was terrified. Did she cheat on me? Did something happen? My eyes were frantically searching every single inch of her face trying to find all of my answers. Her eyes were on mine and she closed them briefly before nodding her head once. \"I had an abortion in May, right before we graduated.\" She whispered, and I felt my hands let go of her hands and I took three steps away from her. My eyes going wide as I stumbled into the wall and she let out a loud sob in my direction, but she turned, picked up her bag, and left. My jaw was hanging open and my eyes watching her retreat. The words repeating over and over again in my head. I never blinked. Not once until the door slammed shut and I knew I should chase her. Find her but I was shocked to the floor. My feet wouldn\\'t move, and my eyes couldn\\'t leave the door as one word rang in my head over and over again. Abortion . Friday, May 1 st , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV Troy tugged me closer to him and his nose pressed into my temple, \"I cannot wait for our time together,\" he whispered, and I felt my stomach twist at his words. My mind racing with everything in my trash can at my apartment. \"Yea,\" I finally squeaked out as Troy kissed my lips, then my jaw, before moving to my collarbone. \"How many finals do you have next week?\" Troy asked, and I tried to find an answer, but I was distracted. I was too distracted. \" Gabi?\" I looked up at him and his blue eyes were concerned as I swallowed on the sand paper in my throat. \"Uh…I think three.\" I said, but I didn\\'t have a single clue how many finals I had. I just knew that I had them. That I had to take them. I couldn\\'t study until I did this until I was able to breathe again. \"My parents and siblings are coming into town on Wednesday. They want to do a whole big thing. They are so excited I am graduating with people offering me jobs.\" Troy was chatty, and I just didn\\'t have it in me today. I rolled away from him and he gave me a confused look, \"I have to go study,\" I said with a false smile and he narrowed his eyes towards me. \"We said that tonight was our night.\" He clarified something that we had planned for a while. Before I threw myself into my studies, we would have a night together. We were really good at making sure we had time for each other. I will forever be proud of us for doing that. \" I know,\" I said as my face dropped, \"I just can\\'t give you the attention I want to give you right now. I have too. I don\\'t want our time to be like this. My mind just isn\\'t here.\" I said honestly, and Troy only nodded his head. He knew that I had been busy. He tugged on my hand gently though and my brown eyes found his blue eyes. \"I love you,\" he told me, and I smiled as I leaned in closer to him. I pressed a soft kiss to his forehead. \"I love you too.\" Getting dressed, I quickly left his apartment as I walked down the stairs to my own apartment. Chewing on my lip, I opened the door as I unlocked my bedroom door and I pushed open the bedroom door. Sitting on the counter was the pregnancy test that I bought earlier today, two towns over. I couldn\\'t be spotted buying this or it would start rumors. I inhaled as the only thing I could think of was the night they won the national championship. Chewing down on my lip until it was raw, I peed on it and then I paced back and forth. I couldn\\'t possibly be pregnant. Troy and I were smart. I went back to birth control after my IUD was taken out six months ago. I was religious with it. Troy and I mostly used condoms as well. We did have a few nights that it didn\\'t happen but for the most part, we always used condoms and relied on my birth control. There was no chance. Zero. My phone dinged with the allotted five minutes and I felt the panic rise in my chest. I flipped the test over and my whole body was frozen. Pregnant. A sob released from my throat as I sank to the floor. I was starting Medical School. I had one more year of eligibility. My brain began to slowly count the months in my head as I counted down to eight because the last time Troy went without a condom was that night. I still took my birth control that night though. I wouldn\\'t have this baby until January. I couldn\\'t. The sobs shook my chest as I rested my hand on my belly terrified. I knew I truly only had one choice but that wasn\\'t fair to this baby or Troy. Troy. I couldn\\'t tell him. He would never let me abort our baby. I grimaced at the thought alone. He would be such a great father, but he hadn\\'t even picked a job yet. He had a few different offers, but he was keeping his options open. He was still doing interviews every so often. I was proud of him and I didn\\'t want to drag him down with this choice. This wasn\\'t fair to him. I had to do it. I wouldn\\'t tell him. I wouldn\\'t tell anybody. I tilted my head forward as I felt the guilt eat at my stomach. If I was at a different spot in my life, I would be welcoming this. I would be happy. This just wasn\\'t the right time for me and I had to put me first. I never put myself first. I wanted to go to medical school. I wanted to play my last year of basketball. Basketball was already ripped away from me once, I wasn\\'t allowing it to happen again. I stood up as I wiped my tears, I threw away my pregnancy tests and I googled the closest location and what I needed to do for this to be over and done with. Gabi\\'s POV The moment I stepped outside of his apartment I doubled over in pain. I never wanted to tell him what I did all those months ago. I never wanted to see the hurt on his face. It was just supposed to be easy in and out procedure, that I asked some freshman girl to take me to on the team. I paid her to keep her trap shut and it had worked. Yet, the moment I saw Troy Bolton after that I felt guilt. Deep and imbedded guilt in my bones. He didn\\'t deserve what I did to him. It just so happened the first time I saw him after I had the abortion is when he told me about the job in Durham that appeared out of nowhere and he took it. So, I pushed all of my anger towards that. We fought all summer about it. I finally tried my best move to push him away with his swift push trying to break-up with him, but he wouldn\\'t budge. The man was stuck in a puddle of cement. No matter how many times I went to him at night and no matter how many times I ignored him during the day. He still let me come. Every single time. So, tonight, when he said he had enough of this hot and cold game. I felt my final straw burst and I told him. The moment his hands left my body was when the rushing cold air enveloped me and the second, he took steps backward caused everything in me to crack and shatter. He hated me. Now, I didn\\'t want him to hate me though. Now I just wanted him to comfort me because I didn\\'t have to hide my secret anymore. I didn\\'t have to have guilt eating at me. He knew. I could fucking breath again. Yet, he didn\\'t come after me. The sobs tore through my chest and I just sat in the stairwell sobbing. It wasn\\'t like it was an easy decision, but it was the right decision for me. I was getting ready to start Med school. I still had another year of eligibility for basketball. He was just starting out in his career making pennies. I wasn\\'t ready for a baby and neither was he. I just didn\\'t ask him about it. I wasn\\'t going to let my senior season go for basketball to have a baby. I want kids, don\\'t get me wrong, and it eats at me all the time that I had an abortion. I wasn\\'t proud, but I knew that it was the right choice for me. \"Gabi?\" I tilted my head back to see Grey looking at me with concern. I only sobbed harder and Grey sat down on the other side of me. \"G, baby, what\\'s wrong?\" he hugged me close to his body and I couldn\\'t stop crying long enough to tell him. \"I love him so much,\" I whispered and Grey just hugged me tighter. \"I have a feeling you just broke his heart.\" He whispered, and I only nodded my head up and down. Grey sighed heavily and we both sat there while he let me cry. \"You know that man loves you so much, right Gabi? I don\\'t know why you are so upset that he stayed here.\" I shook my head, \"You\\'ll have to go talk to Troy, I bet he needs somebody.\" I whispered as I tried to gain composure, so I could go back to my apartment. Grey\\'s face was blank, and he was trying to search my face for answers. I bit down on my lip and I began to stand up, \"Why don\\'t you go talk to Lauren?\" he asked as he tugged on my arm. I shook my head back and forth, \"No. I have to leave. I can\\'t be here right now.\" I told him trying to pull away, but Grey\\'s face was only distraught. \"Gabi, please, Lauren said you haven\\'t talked to her in weeks. She is upset because she feels like she\\'s losing you.\" I shook my head back and forth because it was true. I was pulling away from everybody because I couldn\\'t handle the guilt of eating at my insides. I was fucking guilty and an awful human. How am I supposed to live with myself? I lied to my boyfriend. I lied to my friends. I even let somebody kill my baby. Pulling away from Grey I began to walk down the stairs. \"Gabi, please, if you break his heart, he will never survive that.\" My lips were dry, my body was hurt, and I was exhausted. I was already tired from the game but the conversation with Troy took more out of me than the entire game did. \"It\\'s already too late,\" I whispered as I finished going down the stairs. My body screaming for me to go back to check on Troy, to tell Grey the truth, and to just talk to my best friend again for the first time in a long time. I was ashamed, I was terrified, and I just wanted my boyfriend back. I hated that I had the abortion the same time he found out about his Durham job. I would have been excited. I would have been happy. I am happy. I just found an outlet for my anger and I was just exhausted. Rolling my lips together I slid into my car as I just let my head lean against the steering wheel. My phone rang in my cup holder and I looked down to see Trevor calling me. A wave of nausea rose in my throat and I pushed it back down. My avoidance was with absolutely everybody. Especially, Vivian. I felt guilty. I couldn\\'t shake it either. I tried. I was just hoping that telling Troy would ease the guilt, but it was sitting on the top of my chest. Pressing down harder and harder with the need to break free. I wanted to scream it from the top of the world what had happened, but I would be shamed. I would bring bad press towards Duke and I didn\\'t want that either. Closing my eyes, I turned my car over and I backed out of the parking lot. The drive was short and I pulled into my apartment. Going inside and upstairs, I only crawled into my bed. I pulled the covers up over my head and I cried because I lost the love of my life, I got rid of my baby, and everything inside was completely voided. Troy\\'s POV The door opened and shut but I just tilted back the bottle of whiskey. It burned down my throat, but I was drunk by this point. There was no returning and it was exactly the state I wanted to be in. I should have gone after her. I should have told her that I didn\\'t care about the baby. I should have been better, but I was frozen. I was stuck. I couldn\\'t move. \"Oh buddy,\" I looked over at Grey as he was in a pair of shorts with a long-sleeve shirt. His eyes were stuck on the Whiskey in my hand. The bottle that was almost empty. \"Troy, man, what the fuck happened?\" Grey settled on the couch next to me and I fucking laughed. I laughed until the tears were running down my face. I was laughing and crying sitting on my couch drinking whiskey until I couldn\\'t feel anymore. Yet, I couldn\\'t stop feeling. I couldn\\'t stop feeling her inside of my chest. The need to chase her. The need to go after her. To love her. I will never not love her. Grey could only give me a concerned look before he eased the bottle out of my head. He took a whiff before he tilted the bottle back himself. \"She had an abortion,\" I said quietly, and I could have sworn he broke his neck from turning to look my direction so quickly while forcing the liquid down his throat. \"What the fuck?\" Grey said, and I nodded as I let my hands hold my head. My fingers locked behind and I just laughed again shaking my head back and forth. \"Apparently right before graduation. Sometime in there. I don\\'t know. I never knew she was even pregnant. I don\\'t fucking know.\" Grey didn\\'t answer anything, he just took another long pull of the whiskey. \"Jesus,\" he whispered. I only nodded my head. \"I don\\'t know what to say. I should have gone after her. I should have told her that I didn\\'t care but…I\\'m hurt she never told me. I\\'m pissed. I\\'m angry. I\\'m fucking stuck on what the fuck to do. She\\'s the love of my damn life and she just lies to me?\" I shook my head trying to stop the force of tears that were going to happen. I was drunk, vulnerable, and I fucking missed that girl like no other. Grey exhaled heavily because we both knew that I would have to talk to Gabi to get the full story. It wasn\\'t like I wasn\\'t going to talk to her again, I just need a moment. \"It\\'s probably best if you waited until tomorrow anyway.\" Grey patted my back and he laid back on the couch as he stared up at the ceiling. \"I would have never imagined that was what was bugging, Gabi.\" Grey said, \"She was torn up in the hallway.\" I sat up quickly to look at him, but it caused rapid dizziness from me. Grey looked at me surprised, \"Is she out there? Jesus, I knew I should have followed her.\" I quickly stood up, but all of the whiskey-fueled my body. I could feel the sway in my motion. \"She left. I made sure she calmed down before she left. She kept saying she broke your heart and that I had to come to talk to you. She wasn\\'t going to tell me. I understand why now.\" I shook my head, \"She didn\\'t break my heart. She just…\" I paused to think about what had happened in this apartment tonight. \"She surprised the fuck out of me. I don\\'t know how in the hell I was supposed to react. She was gone faster than I could actually react to the news she delivered.\" Grey couldn\\'t stop a smile from etching over his lips, \"Imagine that, you can\\'t even hate her for that.\" I shook my head as I ran my fingers through my hair, down my face, across my stubble. \"Did Lauren know?\" Grey shook his head back and forth, \"No. She would have told me.\" I exhaled and felt my eyes trying to slip shut. \"I should be mad at her…\" Grey sighed, \"I don\\'t think you can be mad at her until you get the full story out of her.\" My eyes stared at the picture of Gabi and me on my end table. She was smiling up at me while my hand was on her face. My thumb stroking her cheek. \"I think Gabi probably had her reasons for everything. I\\'m not sure why she wouldn\\'t just tell you but maybe she was scared of how you were going to react.\" I rubbed my fingers to my temples as I couldn\\'t think straight anymore. \"I need to go to bed. I\\'m drunk.\" Grey nodded, \"Yea, we can talk more tomorrow morning.\" He helped me into the bedroom and I laid on my bed without taking any of my clothes off. \"I love her man, so damn much, I had a ring,\" I mumbled, and Grey looked at me with a bit of surprise. \"I know buddy,\" I nodded my head as I looked at the ceiling fan, \"Yup. I had it all picked out and I was going to wait a few more weeks before buying it. That\\'s when everything turned to shit and I backed off. I don\\'t know. I just…I would have been there for her.\" I mumbled in my drunken state. Chewing down onto my lip, Grey sighed, \"Just talk to her tomorrow, okay? Get some sleep.\" He shut my lights off. He then shut my bedroom door, but he didn\\'t leave my apartment. I heard the TV flicker on and I closed my eyes. I was thankful for a friend like him. Tuesday, November 3 rd , 2020 \"Hadley, no, man, I just don\\'t feel so hot. I don\\'t want to spread my illness around the office. I\\'ll be back tomorrow but I think a day away from the office will be good. If you need anything done email it to me and I\\'ll see what I can get done from my apartment.\" Hadley spewed an answer through the phone line, but my head was throbbing so bad I couldn\\'t focus on his words. The only thing I knew was that I couldn\\'t go to work today. I was in no right mind to go into the office and act like I knew what I was doing. All night the only thing I could dream about was Gabi saying the word abortion over and over again. Hadley finally shut up and my phone landed on my chest as my eyes closed again. My mind was stuck on the abortion but the thing that I was really caught up on was that Gabi was scared to tell me. She was scared that I wouldn\\'t support what she wanted to do. I could only imagine how scared she was and how alone she felt through the entire thing. I should have been there for her. That was the only thing that made me angry. I just wanted to be there for her and she pushed me away. My head throbbed again as I stuffed my face into a pillow. My mouth was dry as a desert and my body just hurt. It was a fitful night of sleep that my drunk state couldn\\'t even drag me under. I constantly was tossing and turning through the evening trying to find sleep, to just let go and rest, but my mind was spinning. After a few more minutes I swung my feet out of bed and planted them on the ground. My elbows resting on my knees as I rubbed my eyes. \"Hey man,\" I tilted my head back to see Grey and I just nodded as I went into the bathroom to grab my toothbrush. \"I brewed some coffee. I tried to do it the way you like but I know…\" he stopped as I looked at him and he shook his head. \"You look like hell,\" I grunted as I spit out the spit collecting in my mouth from my toothbrush. I rinsed my face and I just shook my head. \"I can\\'t believe she had an abortion without telling you. That is what I would be angry about.\" Grey finally said as if he thought about it all night long as well. I just nodded, \"Basically why I am mad. I just…I have to talk to her, but I want to be in a clear head when I do it. I need to not be hungover and I think a few hours of sleep would be a good idea as well.\" I mentioned as I changed into shorts with a t-shirt. I went out to pour myself a cup of coffee as I leaned against the bar. My lips rolling together as I couldn\\'t stop thinking about everything. Shaking my head, I looked up at Grey, \"How upset was she last night? I feel bad that I didn\\'t go after her. I wanted to go after her. I was just stuck. I was surprised and shocked.\" I told him honestly, \"I couldn\\'t process anything other than the word abortion. I had to mentally connect the word abortion to pregnancy and that meant she was pregnant with a baby. My baby. \" Grey couldn\\'t help but chuckle. \"I can only imagine your face during that moment.\" I rolled my eyes as I sipped my coffee. \"I was in shock and then I just drowned myself in whiskey because I figured she was long gone by that point and I was fucking shocked.\" Grey sighed, \"She was really upset. She couldn\\'t calm down for the longest time and I about came to beat down your damn door to ask you what the fuck she did.\" I grimaced as Grey tilted his head to the side. \"I think you two will be okay. She told me last night that she really loves you. That she hated breaking you and that she just wanted you to be happy.\" He rolled his hands together and he looked at me, \"Now that she doesn\\'t have to hide that anymore and the fact that you wanted to chase after her last night. I think it will just take time for the two of you to patch up this spot in your relationship.\" My phone buzzed next to me as I realized it had been sitting out here all night. Grey glanced at it and he nodded, \"It buzzed a few times last night.\" I picked it up and I scrolled through the different text messages. 1:24 am Gabi: I\\'m so sorry, Troy. So sorry. 1:51 am Gabi: I wish I could be there right now. I wish I didn\\'t do this to you. I wish…I wish I would have been honest with you. I\\'m sorry. 2:30 am Gabi: I understand if you hate me. I would hate me too. I just…I have so much to say still. I want to talk to you but if you don\\'t want to ever talk to me again. I understand. I\\'m sorry. 8:13 am Gabi: I miss you. I exhaled as I read over the messages and I knew I needed to say something, so she understood that I just needed a moment to think. I just needed to wrap my head around this. I just…I needed a moment. 8:17 am Troy: I want to talk. I do. I just need a day or two to wrap my mind around this. Please, don\\'t take this the wrong way. Just give my mind some time to catch up. I then shut my phone off because I didn\\'t know what else to say. Uh…hi. So welcome back to these characters! I bet you didn\\'t expect…this. It was the wild hair that caught my attention to this story and getting to re-fall in love with Gabi and Troy. OF course, there had to be conflict but…yea. I really hope all of you enjoyed. This was surprising, to say the least, and I can\\'t wait to hear all of your reactions! Please please tell me what you think! Thanks for coming back and joining me with another story of these characters! Please Review! Next Update: February 24th'][Chapter 2] ['Chapter 2 – Talk to Me Thursday, November 5 th , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV I couldn\\'t focus on basketball with Troy and I not talking. He sent me that one text and I gave him space. I knew that he needed that time because I dropped a huge bombshell on him. I hadn\\'t heard from Grey or Lauren since that night. I can only assume they were there for Troy. I just hoped that Troy would let me explain. I just hope that he would let me talk to him because I missed him. I knew that there was no going back on our relationship. He was never going to forgive me, there was just no way. \"Montez!\" Coach P snapped as I missed another shot during the drill and I just shook my head. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I said as I wiped the sweat from my face. \"I am just…distracted,\" I muttered, and Coach P shook her head back and forth. \"You are more than distracted. You haven\\'t been able to focus in days.\" She remarked, \"Hell, Gabi, you haven\\'t been able to focus most of this season. What is the matter? You are my star player.\" The lump grew in my throat and I just shrugged my shoulders as I didn\\'t want to talk to anybody here about this. I would tell Coach P but I couldn\\'t say it with everybody looking right at me. The entire team had their eyes on me and only one girl knew: Brooke. Her eyes were stuck on me with wide saucers. Her face scared that I was about to spill right here in front of everybody, but I couldn\\'t, and I wouldn\\'t. \"Come with me,\" Coach P said, and I looked down as I followed her to her office. Tears were full in my eyes as she walked into her office and I followed. \"Gabi,\" she said softly, and I knew that she was concerned. I was always focused on basketball. The tears flowed freely down my face as she knew this wasn\\'t like me. Her arms circled me in and she hugged me close to her body. \"What happened?\" she asked, and I tried to find the words, but I was lost. My eyes looked up at her and she had me sit down while she sat on the edge of her desk. Taking several deep breaths, I finally stopped my tears as my eyes took her in. \"Last May, I found out I was pregnant,\" I told her quietly and her body stilled. Coach P shocked into silence as she stared at me. \"I had an abortion and I never told anybody. I didn\\'t tell Troy, I didn\\'t tell my parents, I didn\\'t even tell my best friend. I then lashed out at Troy all summer. We argued about his job, but I only ever started that fight because I didn\\'t want him to know about abortion. I tried to push him away, but he wouldn\\'t let me. He constantly was there, even when I tried to break-up with him. I finally snapped the other night and told him, and he hasn\\'t talked to me since. I don\\'t know,\" I cried again as Coach P didn\\'t say anything for the longest time. \"Oh Gabi,\" she finally sat down on the other side of me while she rubbed my back. My eyes closing from the weight of the world on my shoulders. \"You shouldn\\'t have had to do that by yourself.\" She told me quietly and I shook my head. \"I couldn\\'t have told Troy because he would have hated me for aborting his baby. He would have wanted me to keep it. He just graduated. I couldn\\'t tell my dad because he would have killed Troy alive. I couldn\\'t tell you because then you would have been disappointed. I didn\\'t want to start any rumors, so I did it without anybody knowing.\" Coach P shook her head, \"Gabi, I have always told you and every single girl on this team to just come to talk to me.\" I bit down on my lip, \"I know, I know, I wanted too. I just…I didn\\'t want to start anything.\" Coach P shook her head and I could see her eyes filling with something. \"You need to talk to Troy before you can get back on the court. You are distracted because he knows, and you don\\'t know how he is reacting to the news. What did he say to you?\" she asked, and I scratched my knee with my finger as my eyes were trained on one singular spot. \"When I told him? Nothing.\" I took a deep breath before I met her eyes again. \"He was surprised. He was holding my hand and the moment I said it he let go of me and stumbled backwards away from me. He didn\\'t know what to say.\" I paused as I thought back to the moment. How his blue eyes were instantly filled with shock and then quickly after hurt. How his jaw stiffened and his whole body was rigid. \"Honey, you dropped a bombshell on him.\" Coach P told me quietly, \"How did you expect him to react?\" I shrugged, \"I never planned on telling him. He was just trying his damn hardest to keep me around and I don\\'t deserve him. He deserves somebody who doesn\\'t abort his baby, he deserves somebody who doesn\\'t lie to him, he deserves so much more.\" Coach P shook her head back and forth, \"No, you have to let him decide all of those things. This is going to eat at you until you talk to him.\" Her face was sincere, and I didn\\'t see any disappointment or hurt that I hid it from her as well, but she just wanted what was best for me. \"I texted him later that night to just…to just tell him that I missed him.\" I said quietly, \"He texted me back the next morning that he just needed a few days of space and that he needed to wrap his mind around everything. I told him on Monday and it\\'s Friday.\" I replied quietly causing Coach P to rub my back again. \"You need to give him that time. He deserves it but for your sake on the basketball court, I hope you two talk soon.\" I inhaled as I rubbed my face. \"I hate that I did it to him, but I had to do it for me. I had to.\" Coach P didn\\'t say anything for a minute before she let off a little smile, \"Gabi, Troy loves you. Like, really loves you.\" She told me, \"I think if you would have just talked to him then he might have understood from the very beginning. I\\'m assuming basketball played into your decision along with medical school. I understand both things probably were big factors and I think Troy would have understood that.\" I didn\\'t say anything as I tugged on my basketball shorts. \"How about you go take a shower and be done for the day? You look like you need a mental break.\" I just nodded as she stood up. \"I\\'m not disappointed in you, Gabi. I just wish you would have come to me. I wish I could have been there for you.\" Biting down on my lip I just nodded while she walked towards the door. I sat here for a few moments before I stood up and I walked in the locker room, but I knew exactly where I needed to go. There was only one place I could go on a day like today. Monday, May 4 th , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV \" Brooke,\" I said her name loudly and she turned around to look at me with wide eyes. \"Yea?\" she asked in return and I looked around before I pulled her towards the back of the locker room. \"I need you to help me with something but what I am about to tell you, can\\'t go anywhere but between you and me.\" I told her quietly and she just nodded her head. \"Promise me, Brooke. If this comes out, I will know it came from you because you are the only person I am telling.\" She again just nodded her head as I sucked in a deep breath. It had been on my mind all weekend. I was avoiding Troy to the best of my abilities until it was taken care of because once it was then I didn\\'t feel like I was lying. Afterward,s it was denial, what pregnancy? There never was one. \" Gabi are you okay?\" I quickly nodded, \"Yes, I just…I need you to drive me to planned parenthood and back, okay? I just…\" her jaw dropped open and she them clamped it shut within seconds. I shook my head because I couldn\\'t let her say the words. \"Okay, when?\" she finally managed to say, and I let out a large sigh. \"I don\\'t have any finals on Thursday, do you think you could do it that day?\" she nodded again, \"Yes, I can.\" I swallowed against the growing lump in my throat and I nodded. \" Yes, I uh…thank you. If you need my help with anything afterwards then I am here for you.\" She smiled, \"I\\'m sorry,\" she spoke, and I nodded, \"I\\'m sorry, too.\" She chewed on her lip and I tried to find words, but they were all stuck. I was stuck. I couldn\\'t believe I was pregnant. I had taken several more tests and they all came back positive. I was terrified. \"I\\'ll see you Thursday,\" she said, and I nodded while she disappeared. My gut tightened with regret and disappointment for myself. I just knew that this wasn\\'t the time for a baby. Troy wasn\\'t ready, and I wasn\\'t ready. This was a losing situation that we were both in. A wave of nausea kicked in and I doubled over trying to hold it back. The door to the locker room opened and I bolted upright. \"Gabs? Are you in here?\" I turned to see Troy standing in the doorway with a look towards me. A look of worry etching in his face and I swallowed down on my panic. \"Hi!\" I said a little too loudly and he turned his head. \" Hi, you okay?\" I nodded, and I walked over to wrap my arms around his neck. \"I missed you,\" I whispered kissing his jaw. He smiled, \"I\\'ve missed you, too. I was coming to see if you wanted to go to the basketball court for a bit? I need a stress relief after my last final.\" I nodded my head, \"Yea, just give me a minute okay?\" he nodded, and he kissed me again. His blue eyes hovered over my face after he pulled back as if he was looking for all the answers. I prayed that he couldn\\'t see that I wasn\\'t telling him something. I was hoping that he couldn\\'t see that I was afraid. I was hoping that he couldn\\'t see that I was pregnant with his child. I could only hope that my eyes didn\\'t betray me. He kissed my forehead, \"You sure you\\'re okay?\" he asked softly, and I just nodded, \"Yes, I am okay.\" I promised as I squeezed his wrist softly. He nodded, \"I\\'ll wait for you outside.\" I thanked him and the moment he left, I was on my knees in the bathroom. Fuck. Troy\\'s POV Friday, November 6 th , 2020 My eyes stared at the ceiling as I had been a zombie since the moment, she told me. I couldn\\'t fight though all of my emotions that had been running through my brain. I couldn\\'t figure everything out and I knew I needed to talk to her, but I was just…confused. The fan circled the ceiling and after a few moments, I finally twisted over planted my feet on the ground. I needed to go to work today but I just didn\\'t have the energy to do it. My elbows rested on my thighs as I rubbed the back of my neck. The tension was just folded underneath and I continued to rub it while trying to motivate myself. Everybody saw through me this week that I was struggling. They were asking me to go out after work, I said yes, and then they were trying to get me to talk but I just drowned more alcohol instead. The buzz in the back of my head told me that I drank too much last night, but I didn\\'t care. The vibration next to me caused me to look up and I reached for my phone. I pulled the phone up to my ear as I answered it, \"Hey honey, did I catch you before work?\" my mom\\'s chipper voice entered my ear as I glanced at the clock. It would only be 4 in the morning in Oregon. What in the fuck was she doing awake and this chipper? \"Mom, what are you doing awake?\" I grumbled as I pushed off my feet and into my bathroom that was attached to my bedroom. \"I was awake and thought about you. I just wondered what you were up to lately, I haven\\'t heard from you in a few days.\" I sighed as I grabbed a towel for a shower and I rubbed my temples after I hung it. \"I am okay.\" I told her, and she didn\\'t say anything for a few moments, \"What\\'s wrong? Are you and Gabi still fighting?\" I hummed with odd laughter and she wanted to say something. She knew I wasn\\'t going to tell her this morning, but I also knew she was interested in my odd response. \"I\\'m sorry.\" She said softly, \"Do you know…\" I cut her off, \"I have to get ready for work mom, I love you. I\\'ll call you soon.\" My mom let out a long sigh, \"Don\\'t make me fly all the way out there, Troy.\" I chewed on my lip and I just nodded, \"Okay, I\\'ll call you tomorrow, okay?\" she sighed, \"Okay, I love you.\" \"I love you, too.\" I hung up as my head was throbbing. I stripped my clothes and stepped into the warm shower. My eyes closing from the warmth surrounding my body. I just wanted to my girlfriend to be in my bed with me every single morning. I just wanted her to wrap her arms around me every single night. I just wanted her. Chewing my lip, I tried to shake all my thoughts of her as I planned on finding her tonight. I had to talk to her. It was eating at me alive. Grey and Lauren were constantly checking in. Lauren was devastated when she found out about Gabi. She was angry with her for lying and not trusting Lauren with such a big piece of information. I wasn\\'t angry too much with her. I was just disappointed and really sad. Not sad that I could have been a father but sad because she didn\\'t trust me either. I would think after almost three years that she would trust me with that information. That I would judge her for her choice and that I would have supported her. It made me sad. I shut my shower off and took my towel. I wrapped it around my waist as there was a knock on my door. I groaned as I was just trying to get my ass to work on time. I walked to the door and swung it open to see that brown-haired girl with those chocolate brown eyes staring back at me. Her eyes were red-rimmed, and she looked so skinny. She was drowning in a pair of leggings with a large sweatshirt that appeared to be mine. Her hair was tied in a knot on the top of her head. Neither of us said a word to each other as she hiccupped. She had been crying. My heart softened, and I tilted my head down, \"I have to go to work, Gabs,\" I said quietly, and she bit on her lip turning her head away. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she whispered, and I knew she wasn\\'t sorry for showing up today but for everything. I only nodded, \"I know. I was going to call you after work today, so we could talk. I\\'m ready.\" Her brown eyes met mine and I looked down at my lack of clothes. \"Come in,\" I told her, and she nodded as she walked into the apartment. \"I\\'ll be right back,\" I said, and she just sat down as I went in pulling on a pair of jeans with a Durham Bulls t-shirt. Casual Friday\\'s were my favorite. I grabbed my tennis shoes and I went back out as Gabi let her eyes trail my body. I grimaced because I missed her in many different ways and sexually was definitely one of them. \"Coach P said I couldn\\'t practice until I talked to you because I can\\'t focus. I can\\'t play. I am a mess.\" Her voice was barely above a whisper and a straight shot to my heart. I knew she was hurting. I knew this was hard for her. Yet, I made no moves any earlier. My chest rose and fell with hurt as I went over towards her. I sat down on the other side of the couch and I rested my elbows on my knees. I wasn\\'t sure what to say right now because I had to go to work and I couldn\\'t have a long conversation with her. I needed coffee if I was going to make it through this morning. Biting down on my lip, I sighed, \"Tell Coach P you\\'ll be ready to go tomorrow. If that\\'s all you need from me.\" I pushed off the couch and she let out another cry. A straight shot to my heart as I closed my eyes. That sound caused my whole body to hurt. \"That\\'s not all I need from you. I…\" she tried to stop the sob with her hand over her mouth. \"I need you, too.\" I tried to hold back a chuckle, but it escaped. Twisting around I faced her to see that she was destroyed on the inside. She was crying into her hands and she looked at me. I knew she was telling the truth, but I also knew that I deserved better than that. \"I wish you would have needed me 6 months ago.\" I didn\\'t wait long after that before I grabbed my shoes and my backpack before leaving. Gabi\\'s POV I deserved that comment. Whole heartedly I deserved that comment. I should have needed him six months ago. I should have done a lot of things different, but I couldn\\'t. A sob broke through my voice as the door slammed shut and I buried my face against my hands. I don\\'t know why I came here this morning. I wasn\\'t sleeping. I wasn\\'t eating, and I knew I just needed to talk to Troy. I guess I forgot that he had a job that demanded his attention. Just like I had school work that needed my attention. I just couldn\\'t focus or breath. I was lost. I missed him. I was really glad that he knew now so that I didn\\'t have to hide it anymore. I just needed him to end it so that I could move forward. That I could deal with my heartbreak. I rubbed my eyes as I knew Lauren was angry with me. Grey was on Troy\\'s side. I was just stuck. My eyes took in Troy\\'s apartment as the only time I had truly been here was for sex and to leave. I treated Troy like complete shit for months. There was no way that he could ever actually love me again. My lips pressed together, and I exhaled before I stood up. I had a class in an hour and I had to focus. I was in medical school and a really good one at that. I interviewed at three different places, but I was pretty sure Coach P pulled some strings. Not that I didn\\'t deserve it, but I was sure that was one of the reasons. We only had a handful of clinicals and my professors were really good about working around my schedule. I missed a few practices, but it was working out. My body sagged with defeat as I walked back to my apartment as I walked here this morning. I pushed open the door and I found my backpack and cell phone. I debated about sending Troy a text message, but I was going to leave him alone. He was probably really angry that I showed up this early in the morning, but I just didn\\'t know what else to do. My phone buzzed, and I quickly picked it up to only see Brooke calling me. She had become a closer friend since that day and I had been showing her a lot more with basketball as a thanks for helping me. \"Hi,\" I answered, and she sighed, \"How are you?\" she asked, and I glanced around, \"I\\'m okay. I wish Troy and I had time to talk but he\\'s been working, and he wasn\\'t ready a few days ago.\" I told her, and Brooke sighed, \"I\\'m sorry.\" She spoke softly, \"I wish that I could be better help.\" I smiled softly, \"Brooke, you\\'ve kept a really big secret for me. I still need it to stay between us on the basketball team, but Coach knows. Troy knows.\" \"I\\'m glad. You weren\\'t yourself after that and I think Troy knowing will help.\" I sighed, \"I\\'m not sure that I will ever be able to actually be myself again. That changed me. I feel guilty all of the time.\" I spoke, and Brooke barely said anything as what was there to say. \"Do you want to get drinks tonight?\" she asked. My eyes looked at the wall to see that it was Friday. Every Friday I had a standing date with Troy unless we had a game or were going to be away for a tournament. Friday night Troy would always show up to the court and would bring coffee. It was always different every single week. It was another safe period in our relationship. After dark and Friday nights were the only times where I didn\\'t get mad at him and he didn\\'t ask any questions. We were just together. I think those times saved our relationship but there was no returning to that most likely, but I would show up tonight. I had too. I knew Troy wanted to talk tonight. \"I can\\'t tonight.\" I told her after a moment and she sighed, \"Friday night, yes, I remember.\" I just nodded my head not knowing what else to say. \"You can do it, Gabi. I always thought that Troy would understand but I will also always support your decision. It was yours to make.\" My lip was raw from the constant chewing and I just nodded my head, \"I get it. I\\'ll hopefully talk to him tonight.\" Making my way through campus I sighed, \"Brooke, maybe we can get coffee tomorrow and talk about my newly single life.\" Brooke didn\\'t say anything for a few moments before she had her words of advice, \"Have some hope, Gabi. He loves you.\" I just snorted. Troy Bolton may love me, but he wasn\\'t a saint. I would be angry if he hid something like that from me. Furious. I made it even worse blaming him for taking a job that I knew was good for him and good for everything. Yet, I yelled at him. I belittled him. I made him think so much worse than it actually was. He still showed up to expo games, scrimmages, and our first game. He was so excited to watch me this year and I was robbing him that chance. I exhaled. Fuck this. Troy\\'s POV I collapsed into my chair after work that was a typical boring day. My eyes stared at the clock as Gabi didn\\'t call me afterwards and she didn\\'t send a text, but I knew I hurt her with that one comment. I knew she also slightly deserved it. Pushing onto my feet, I went to change into a pair of shorts with a Duke t-shirt. I slid on my tennis shoes while I picked up a basketball. I walked down the apartment steps as I did my regular Friday routine. I would walk to Rents and then I would walk to the basketball court. I have done it every single Friday since I graduated and some Friday\\'s she would show up and we would play. Some Friday\\'s she wouldn\\'t show up at all. Some Friday\\'s we just sit on the court with each other. There never was a lot of talking but I figured that would change today. Rolling my lips together I tilted my head back as I walked the sidewalk. Pulling my phone out, I called Grey. \"Hey man,\" I sighed, \"I just don\\'t know what to say to her. She showed up at my place this morning and I didn\\'t know what to say. I have never had a moment with Gabi where I didn\\'t know what to say. From the moment we met, we have constantly been able to talk with each other. We may have been arguing but we knew always knew how to talk with each other.\" Grey sighed from the other end of the phone as he had a lot of these phone calls since that night. \"Are you going to the court?\" I kicked a rock as I tried to talk myself out of it, but I wasn\\'t able too. \"Yes,\" I said stubbornly. \"Just play basketball for a little bit and then maybe the conversation will just happen. She hasn\\'t reached out to me or Lauren.\" I chewed on my lip, \"I feel bad in a way that I should have picked up on it.\" I told him honestly as I neared in on Rents. \"I should have saw the change. It happened right around graduation though with my job. There was a lot of change, but I should have seen it.\" \"Do not beat yourself up over this,\" Grey warned. \"She kept it from you.\" \"I know,\" I told him, \"I honestly know but I also love her. I also know she was probably scared. I know that she has a lot going on right now and what…for her to be six months pregnant? No way that would have been good. I\\'m just hurt that she didn\\'t trust me enough to allow me to know the information. To trust her judgement. To be there for her.\" \"I think you just need to tell her that. It\\'s okay if you take her back, Troy. Nobody is expecting you to turn her away. Yes, she lied to you. Yes, she probably has a story. Yes, she is absolutely heartbroken over the situation. I think you need to know the whole story before you can make a final decision.\" I inhaled and just nodded my head, \"I will. I will try to do it tonight.\" I opened the door to Rents as I worked here all through college in my spare time. I loved it. I still loved it. I ordered two coffees and when Alyssa slid me my coffees, I thanked her, and I backed away. I continued to the court in silence trying to process everything. When I got to the court she was already sitting there. I sighed as I just went to sit next to her. I handed her the cup of coffee and she thanked me with a sad nod. We both just stared at the sky ahead because the small talk wasn\\'t appropriate. \"I can\\'t do this here.\" She finally said, and I tilted my head towards her. \"Why?\" I asked her, and she swallowed hard. \"I can\\'t have this conversation here. This place is all of the good memories of us. This place was where we first kissed. This place is where I fell in love with you. This is my safe place with you. Just like our indoor court and Rents. Those places are safe with only good memories and if we have this conversation here then this will no longer hold just good memories. I want only good memories here.\" The tears were evident in her voice and I released a heavy breath. \"I just want you to talk to me, B.\" she buried her face into her knees. My jaw tightened as I took a sip of coffee myself. I had no interest in playing basketball today. I had no interest in doing anything that figuring out where everything in our relationship went wrong when I felt like it was so right. \"How about we go back to my apartment. We can hash it out there.\" I told her, and she exhaled heavily before lifting her head up to look at me. \"Can we sit here just a little bit longer as us? I don\\'t know what you want to say to me, I know you have to hate me and don\\'t want to continue this, but I just want ten more minutes of us sitting right here where I first loved you.\" Her words tore through my chest because I couldn\\'t hate her. I could never hate her. That wasn\\'t possible because I loved her too damn much. No, I wasn\\'t sure where this conversation would take us. I didn\\'t want our relationship to end but she was going to have to make me a lot of promises. My eyes looked over at her and she was still in the same clothes as this morning. Her hair braided back though with a different head band. \"I just want to clarify, that I don\\'t hate you. I could never hate you, Gabi. I\\'m upset, I\\'m hurt, and I\\'m disappointed but I am not angry, and I don\\'t hate you .\" She turned her head to catch a glimpse of my eyes. Her brown eyes softened for a moment and she just turned to look at the world again. \"How are you not angry?\" she whispered quietly, and I sighed as I picked at the weeds growing in our court. My fingers carefully taking care of each little strand. I rolled the blades between my fingers and sighed. \"At first, I was angry. I might still have a little anger but that isn\\'t what is feeding my emotions. Look, you don\\'t want to talk about this here and explaining all of that will go into that.\" She only nodded her head in understanding that if I started, I wasn\\'t going to stop talking. \"You know, this court,\" she paused, \"Has seen a lot of things between us. The innocent beginning, the kissing, the constant need to be with each other, the rivalry, the love, the arguments. This one court has seen it all. I can come here, and I can feel you with me. I love it. I love that we have this one place that almost nobody else goes to because that makes it special to just us.\" My eyes were heavy as I thought of her words. She shook her head with a tiny smile, \"This is just one thing I don\\'t want this court to see.\" She stood up slowly and I followed her as she picked up my things and we both slowly began to walk with each other. Our strides fell in sync with each other as we were both quiet until she finally decided to talk. \"I think I could handle angry,\" Gabi said softly as we began to near my apartment, \"I think angry was the emotion I prepared myself most for. The disappointment is the one I am going to have the hardest time to swallow because you know I hate disappointing. I know you have your reasons and I am sure you will tell me all of them but…\" I wasn\\'t sure where she was going with this, but I could see the fear in her eyes. The fear that she was about to lose absolutely everything. \"But what?\" I asked her, my voice on edge, \"But I need you to know that I love you and that I am so fucking sorry for everything. I feel like that\\'s the best way to start but you have to voice everything, and I will tell you everything.\" I just nodded stiffly as I walked ahead. I pushed into my apartment as she followed. I shut the door and she put down her coffee. My jaw ticked with a bit more anger that I was staring at her and that I could see her in my line of vision, but all those other emotions trampled them. \"Like I was saying on the court, anger was the first reaction but after that, I was shocked. I was scared. I was upset with myself because I didn\\'t see that you were going through something else. Yet, what hurt the most Gabi is that you didn\\'t trust me to come to you with that information? Did you think I wouldn\\'t understand? That I wouldn\\'t be there for you? That…that fucking hurt the most. I thought through the two plus years we have been together I had earned at least that. That I had earned your trust and the thought that I just might understand what was going through your head.\" Tears were running down her face as she stared at me. Those brown eyes were so lost and so far away from the girl, I fell in love with. My voice was gritty and raw as I was battling my own tears, \"I fucking love you, Gabi. So, fucking much. It hurts me to breathe sometimes because I love you. I love you at all hours of the day. At all different situations. We made our relationship work for two years of both of us playing basketball. The constant travel, homework, MCATs, basketball, training, working out. We made all of that fucking work because we communicated. We found the times to be together but the moment something big happens. The moment something scary happens you couldn\\'t even come to me. Do you know how that fucking feels?\" She shook her head, her face filling with pain, because she knew that I went to her with everything. She knew I was constantly communicating and talking with her. \"I was so scared, Troy.\" She whispered, and I laughed, and I nodded, \"I bet you fucking were. I would have been scared but I would have been there for you. I would have helped you.\" I told her, and she bit down on her lip, \"I didn\\'t want to have a baby right then Troy!\" her words flew towards me and I shrugged, \"Okay? I would have been there for you no matter what you decided Gabi! I would have been there if you wanted to do adoption. I would have been there if you wanted to have the baby. I would have been there with you while you had the abortion. I didn\\'t give a flying fuck about that Gabi. I only fucking care about you! When will you fucking understand that?\" She shook her head as if she didn\\'t think any of the words that I said were true. She always had a hard time believing I would put her first, but I would. Always. \"No, you wouldn\\'t have thought that.\" She whispered, and I nodded as she struggled with her emotions and to hold everything together, \"I would have.\" My breathing was ragged, and I was crying now looking at her. Her sobs were loud, and it was taking everything in me to not walk across this room and bury her into my arms. To protect her from my words. To protect her from the future and the past. To just fucking keep her safe because that was all I ever wanted to do. I wanted to keep her safe. I wanted to love her. \"You don\\'t understand why…\" she started to talk but I shook my head. \"No, I figured it out before I went to sleep that night Gabi and I was drunk off my ass when I did! You were getting ready to start medical school. You had one more year of eligibility for basketball and you are out of red-shirt years and we both know that you couldn\\'t do year two of medical school with basketball. This is your last year. You and I weren\\'t married, and I just took a job. We have zero money and you have wants and dreams. I got it. I understand,\" I stressed to her and I saw her face pale and her whole-body slump in defeat. Nailed it. This didn\\'t take long for either of us to figure out, but my mind did it easily. I knew her. Inside and out. I ran my fingers through my hair and then down my jaw as I let out a large breath of air, \"I understand that it was a hard spot to be in. I understand that you were scared. I understand the choices you made. I fucking understand Gabi. What I don\\'t understand is why you didn\\'t think for one second that I would have understand any of that? I never want you to throw your dreams and love away. You worked so fucking hard to get back onto the basketball team. We made a mistake. We took all nthe ecessary precautions, but a mistake was made. I would have listened to you, Gabi.\" She turned around and went to sit on my couch. Her painful tears were still happening, and I went to lean against the wall. Gabi chewed on her lower lip and she shook her head, \"You can\\'t honestly say you wouldn\\'t have wanted that baby if I told you I was pregnant.\" She whispered, and I had considered this. It crossed my mind if she had told me she was pregnant, I would have been happy. But if she would have followed up quickly with what she wanted to do and why? I would have understood in a heartbeat. Maybe, I would have had a little sadness, but I understand. This is her life that would be messed with. \"Maybe I would have but I would have also listened to you. I would have saw your side of things and I would have supported you. Just like when I was looking at jobs, it was always you first. I constantly am going to put your needs above anybody else\\'s because I love you.\" Her face was buried in her hands and she was wiping away tears. Her hands were shaking, and she pressed the palms of her hands into her eyes. It broke my fucking heart. \"Let me ask you a question,\" I proposed, and I walked closer to her. I sat on the opposite couch and leaned my elbows on my knees as I wanted her to look at me. I reached forward, and my fingers found her chin and I tilted it up, so those brown eyes were looking right at me. Her brown eyes that were normally full of life, looked dead and beat. There was nothing there and that caught me completely off guard. Yet, I focused on the task at hand. \"If you were graduating with a normal degree, say teaching, and we were both getting jobs. You didn\\'t have any basketball left to play, would you still have gone and got an abortion?\" I asked her quietly praying I actually knew her answer. Because if she said a different answer, this would turn into an ugly conversation. \"Absolutely not.\" She confirmed quickly, enough to listen to my question and know exactly what her answer already was. \"The guilt eats me alive every single day knowing what I did to our child. That I did that and that I was selfish. That I put my own needs before it but I just…\" That one sentence broke my heart because she had been carrying that around for over six months. Yet, it brought a surge of anger with it. I dropped my head into my hands. I wanted to be there for her but at the same time, she didn\\'t allow me to be there for her. She refused my presence. \"Troy, I am so sorry. I should have done everything different, but it\\'s done now, and I know there is no fixing this. I fucking messed up. You took a job so that you could be close to me and I bet you are regretting that right about now.\" I shook my head in my hands and I lifted it up to look at her. \"That thought hasn\\'t crossed my mind once.\" I told her honestly and she seemed surprised by that answer. Her brown eyes wide and she pulled on her hair gently. \"I\\'m not giving up on this. Yes, we have plenty of shit work through. Yes, we have plenty to still fucking talk about. But you are still mine. You have always been mine and I am not going to let this get in the way of it. I\\'m fucking upset because you lied to me. You thought you knew what I would think and yet…you had zero clue.\" \"You say that now.\" \"No, Gabi,\" the tone of my voice was angry now and her eyes snapped to mine, I never got angry with her. \"I would have not made a different decision then. When you told me, I was only mad that you didn\\'t tell me. I was only mad that you hid it from me. I was only mad because you didn\\'t let me be there for you when I would have. I would have been there every single step of the way and you wouldn\\'t have to do that alone. That was why I was angry. It wasn\\'t the right time for us and we both would have known that then. I would have never asked you to give up your senior year of basketball. I would have never asked you to not go to medical school to have my baby. We are stupidly young still. We have time.\" She bit down on her lip until it drew blood while tilting her head forward. Her forehead almost meeting mine. \"I\\'m just…I wasn\\'t sure how in the hell we got into this situation. I really thought you would have never understood. That you would have begged me to keep it.\" She shook her head back and forth, \"Gabi, I feel like you don\\'t understand how much I know you. Deep down, I\\'m not ready for a kid. I want to get settled into my career. I want to make sure I am able to get further along and that I can provide for a kid. If you had decided to keep it, I would have been just as happy and would have worked harder.\" Standing up, I began to pace the room. \"I was so scared, Troy.\" \"I know you were scared. I would have been too, and I just wish that you would have told me. I would have held your hand and been there for you. I would have never let you do that alone because I cannot imagine how much you were hurting. How much you needed somebody to be there. I would have done everything for you. I would have not questioned you once.\" I barked with a bit louder voice than I wanted, and her body tensed up. She tried to calm her breathing and relax but she was struggling. I only wanted to fucking hold her close to me, but I kept my distance for now. The moment I wrapped her into my arms this thing was over. I was going to be gone. \"You do not get to make choices for me. You do not get to know what I think. If you would have just come to me.\" My voice was raw, and my eyes stared at her. I blinked once, and I knew I shouldn\\'t share this, but I was going to anyways. \"You know, I had a ring picked out.\" Her head snapped up to mine and her face was in disbelief. Her head was going back and forth as if my words weren\\'t true to what she was hearing. \"No,\" she whispered, \"No, no,\" she continued to whisper and shake her head faster. I only nodded my head, \"Yes, I had a ring picked out. I was getting ready to go pick it up and get it. I was ready to buy it and I was going to propose to you after graduation when we were supposed to go to Seaside for a week. I was going to kayak with you to our favorite spot that we spent every summer since we started going. I was going to propose to you because I love you. Because I can only imagine sharing my life with you. Because I thought we shared everything with each other.\" She continued to shake her head more and more as she cried. Her hands pulling at her hair and then her hands covered her face again as if she didn\\'t want to hear any of this. \"Then we started fighting about stupid shit, like my damn job. I backed off because something was wrong, and you didn\\'t want to go to Seaside with me. I was completely and utterly disappointed. Now, I find out about this six months later and…how do I ever know if you\\'ll come to me when big things happen that scare you? What will prevent you from keeping shit from me? If you\\'re willing to keep that from me for six fucking months?\" I breathed, and my eyes looked at her. Her brown eyes held mine and I looked into them, deeply. Trying to find all of the answers deep within her. \"I\\'m so sorry that you went through that alone, but I wish you would have given me the chance. To have at least 10% of faith in me that I would choose you. That I would listen to you .\" I whispered, and she broke down again to the point that I couldn\\'t not go over to her again. I loved her, I could only resist so long. I wrapped her into my arms and eased her onto my lap. My hands running down her body as my body hummed with electricity and a sense of calmness waved over me. \"I just only ever want you to talk to me, Gabi. I want to be important to you. I want you to share those things with me. The good, the bad, the ugly, the scary. I want it all.\" She rested her head on my shoulder and I just let her calm down. Her whole body shaking against me and I knew that she had done enough to her own conscious that I didn\\'t have to be mad. She was mad at herself. She was guilty. She was most likely angry with herself. I didn\\'t want any of that. She slowly began to calm down to the point that she was able to breath. A few hiccups echoed through my living room. \"The moment I found out, I was terrified. It wasn\\'t like I didn\\'t want to have your baby, but it just wasn\\'t the right time. I figured if I just had it done and then moved on it wouldn\\'t be a big deal but…the moment it was done. I felt guilty.\" Her hands wiped away the new tears that escaped, \"Then you approached me, and you were so excited because you had gotten the job in Durham. I was angry because I had just done something to you and you didn\\'t even know. So, I lashed out at the news. We never talked about Durham and it made sense for me to be angry about it. Maybe, it wasn\\'t something to actually be angry about, but it was better than just telling you. In the moment.\" She clarified, and I inhaled listening to her talk. My breathing having trouble regulating. \"And I kept it up because I felt guiltier and guiltier. I wish you would have taken that job in Seattle because you do not deserve me, Troy. You deserve somebody so much better than me. I lied to you. I hurt you. I disappointed you and that hurts. It hurts to know that I disappointed you. That hurts more than anything else.\" My forehead rested into her hair as she continued to talk, and I just let her. She was finally talking to me and I wasn\\'t going to stop her. \"If you would have just left and we would have broken up. It would have been easier, but you kept fighting. You dug your damn heels in and you weren\\'t going to go away. So, I told you. Yet, here we are. You are still here, and I don\\'t fucking deserve you, Troy.\" I went to say something, but she shook her head, \"No. Don\\'t say anything. You have never hidden a damn thing from me. You constantly told me about all the girls who contacted you. You constantly were there for me. You told me about all the jobs you were considering. You told me everything. You were always good to me. You never forgot anything. You met my needs and I can\\'t even give you one damn moment to think for yourself. I do not deserve you. I never will. I will never forgive myself either for doing any of this because,\" she stopped and turned to face me. She was desperately trying to hold my attention. Yet, she had all of my attention. \"Because you, Troy Bolton, are my one true love. You are the man I will forever love and forever hate myself for losing.\" I finally shook my head, my eyebrows wrinkling due to her comment as I was confused. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" I whispered so softly that she would be the only person possible to hear those words from my mouth, and those brown eyes held mine. A sense of surprise rising in them with a strong sense of curiosity. \"You haven\\'t lost me.\" A sob crumbled from her mouth and my lips pressed to her forehead. \"Yes, you made mistakes. Yes, you lied to me for months. Yes, we have a lot of fucking work to do on our relationship, but we aren\\'t over. I\\'m not breaking up with you over this.\" My arms pulled her in tightly to my body and she pressed her snotty nose into my neck. \"I\\'m sorry, I\\'m so sorry Troy.\" My lips pressed to her temple and I didn\\'t say anything for a few minutes. Yes, we had a lot to do but she was also the love of my life and if I let her go because of this? I would hate myself. Yes, I\\'m glad I didn\\'t propose when I had planned on it because obviously, we still had things we needed to work on. We had things that we needed to do. It was going to be a long road, but it was going to be a road that I needed to go down. She was the light to my life and fighting with her for the last six months had been awful. I needed her. \"I have so many more questions,\" I whispered to her, \"But I think we both need to take a step back tonight and breathe. I\\'m not going anywhere, and I am, and I always will be here for you. That will never change. You are still mine. You are my girlfriend. My B. My everything. I just think I need time to wrap all of this up in my head. I need to think about everything that was said and I just…I want to make sure my follow-up questions are worth asking.\" I told her, and she only nodded her head. The pain and the absence of my girl. \"You had every single reason of why I did it, right.\" She told me, and I rubbed her arm as I nodded, \"I know, I know you Gabi.\" \"I wish I would have given you a chance because I did need you .\" My eyes closed, and I almost didn\\'t want to hear that. I didn\\'t want to hear that she wanted me there, but she was too stubborn to allow me to be there for her. \"It was never easy. I wanted to tell you a thousand times. I just…dug my hole and I didn\\'t want to pull myself out of it.\" My lips pressed into the top of her head and I just held her against me. \"I have one rule before you walk out of this apartment tonight.\" I told her, she looked at me and I held her face gently with my fingers. My thumb stroked her skin and she leaned into my touch. \"You have to talk to me. About everything. You can\\'t hide anything from me because I need you to tell me everything. Every little detail and if you have a bad day or if you feel guilty one day, talk to me. I just…I just need you to talk to me.\" She nodded her head, \"I will. I promise.\" I leaned my forehead against hers and I closed my eyes. \"I need you to keep that promise, Gabs. I\\'m not scared of listening to your feelings. I am not scared of you having opinions. I am not scared of you being such a strong woman. What I am scared of is you constantly lying to me now. Will I ever truly understand if you are telling the truth or not?\" Gabi bit down on her lip again and she just nodded sadly, \"I wish I didn\\'t do this.\" She whispered, \"Mostly, because that\\'s the only thing I have ever lied about to you. The only thing I ever kept from you and I know it\\'s huge and awful but…I hate that I lost your trust.\" I sighed heavily myself, \"I hate it, too.\" Well, well…this probably went a bit better than you guys thought. I hope you loved it! I love the response to the first chapter. I loved starting off with such chaos and that nothing is the same as it was before type of situation. I know some of you are confused on how Gabi\\'s character could ever do that and how Troy wouldn\\'t notice this type of thing and I get it. This is completely out of character for Gabi…which is the point. This is something she would never do but it\\'s something she believed she had to do. I hope that was clarified a little bit in this chapter! I love listening to your thoughts about it all! Thanks for the love! PLEASE REVIEW! Next Update: March 10 th'][Chapter 3] ['Chapter 3 – Q&A; Gabi\\'s POV Saturday, November 7 th , 2020 The constant rotating of my fan wasn\\'t helping my insomnia. I chewed on my lip because Troy held me until I was completely calmed down last night, and he walked me to my car. He kissed my forehead before he walked back, and I hadn\\'t heard from him since. My brain was still in a state of shock that he didn\\'t want to break-up with me, he just needed time to process everything. I understood, it was a lot and it made me more upset that he didn\\'t even have to ask why I did it. He already knew. It upset me further because I did need him in those times after it happened. I would lay in my bed and sob because it hurt and because I was guilty as fuck. If I would have had them there? To talk to? Maybe my mind wouldn\\'t be nearly as fucked up as it is right now. I had sent coach a text that we talked and that I felt better. That I was ready to work hard. She was glad, and I was going to go to practice before our game tomorrow. I was hoping that Troy and I were better by his birthday in a few days. I wanted to make-up for him. I wanted to explain everything to him. I just let him get out all of his anger out and then I talked a little bit, but I knew that we got a lot of it off our chests in the very beginning. My alarm clock went off again. I pressed snooze as I pulled up my text messages and I sent one to Troy. G: I just wanted to text you and tell you I\\'m thinking about you. I love you. I am so sorry. I know I will never be able to say that enough to make up for the past several months but I am. I want to work on us and I really hope that we can. I have practice until 12:45 and then I\\'ll be free if you want to talk again. I\\'ll understand if you aren\\'t ready though. Pushing away the blankets I finally got out of bed as I changed into my work-out clothes. My compressed cut-off shirt and I slid on my blue basketball Duke shorts before slipping my feet into a pair of tennis shoes. It was a mildly warm day and I was ready to tackle it. I slipped my backup on when my phone buzzed again. I looked down afraid to see what he said back to me, but I couldn\\'t be afraid anymore. T: Let\\'s talk after practice. Pick the place and I\\'ll meet you at 1:30. I love you, too. I exhaled as I just replied with Rents because the hard conversation took place last night. This would hopefully be easier. He wasn\\'t going to break-up with me and he wasn\\'t going to break-up with me. That was my main concern last night at the court. If he did that last night, then I was going to freak out. It may have been just a basketball court, but it wasn\\'t something I was going to be able to handle. I walked out the door when I ran into Jade and Courtney. \"Hey! The coach said you have been sick, the past couple of days.\" Jade said, \"Are you feeling better?\" I nodded with a tight smile, \"Just some stuff going on, but I am so much better.\" I replied even though I wasn\\'t so much better, but I was better. \"Good, we need you out there.\" Chewing on my lip I was worried about everything else in my life. Classes that I was falling behind in. Basketball that I needed to work harder in. Making my relationship a priority with Troy. It all made me dizzy. We all entered the arena with each other. Jade was a red-shirt freshman and a year younger than me. She was the only girl from the original team that I was supposed to be on. This was my fourth and final year of eligibility even though I lost a year for the five-year rule. I was just lucky enough that I was able to play. I went to my locker as I laced up my ankle braces, pulled on my basketball shoes, and tugged on my practice jersey. Most girls were still coming in when I walked to the court. I picked up a basketball and I then got lost in the court with twenty minutes before practice. I worked on shooting, running, and just trying to get back into the swing of things. \"Gabi,\" I stopped as I was already sweating, and Coach P was looking at me. \"You look better.\" She told me with a nod, \"Keep it up.\" I just nodded back at her as I went to get a drink and wipe the sweat away from my face. Chewing on my lower lip, I did my warm-ups with the girls and then we were thrown into drills. I pushed my body harder than I had all season. I ran every down and back and was the first one back. I didn\\'t miss and when I did, I worked twice as hard the next time to not miss. I cheered on my teammates and I was barely standing by the time practice was over. My legs were liquid, but I still pushed forward. I was not going to slack anymore. I had too much shit to do. I had to be perfect. Once the final whistle blew, we all rounded up as Coach P was grinning at me. \"You guys need to start taking notes. Gabi has been out for a few days but came back and worked harder than any of you. By twice as much. Work hard. If we\\'re going to redeem ourselves for that championship season, then we have to work harder. You all know it too.\" Everybody grumbled, and Coach P pulled me aside. \"Gabi, you did well today. I\\'m glad you talked to Troy. How is everything?\" she asked quietly and away from the team. I pulled on my shirt to find a dry spot to help wipe off my face. \"Uh…it went okay. He understood why I did it. He was mostly just angry that I didn\\'t allow him to be there for me. I feel stupid now about it, but I also was scared then. I don\\'t know. I\\'m meeting up with him after practice, so he can ask, and we can talk a little bit more. He wasn\\'t angry though. Just disappointed, which I think is harder for me.\" Coach P nodded in understanding. \"I\\'m glad that he is being open to being with you.\" I tried to hide a smile, but I couldn\\'t. \"That boy loves me. I always knew that, but I think this reinforced it. He isn\\'t going anywhere.\" Coach P squeezed my hand. \"You\\'ll do big things, Gabi. It wasn\\'t the time and you made a hard decision. Next time let people be there for you. You\\'ve had a really hard time the past couple of years with the trust of other people, but you know you can trust a handful of people. You can trust me. You can trust Troy. You can trust your brother. You can do all of that. Maybe it would have been harder with your parents. But you have people, Gabi. More people than you did three years ago.\" I thanked her with a hug and she smiled. \"Now, go talk.\" I walked back into the locker room as I grabbed my change of clothes with a towel as I headed for the showers. I took my time showering and when I was done, I dressed in a pair of ripped jeans with a crew neck Duke sweatshirt. I slid my converse on my feet and tied them up. Brooke was sitting at her locker when I came out. Her eyes looked up at me as all of the other girls were either on the court or had left already. \"How did it go?\" she asked, and I sighed sitting on the other side of her. \"It went okay. He doesn\\'t want to break-up, but he doesn\\'t have a whole lot of trust in me.\" I said with a shrug, I played with the strings on my jeans as I looked at her. \"He uh…was planning on proposing to me this past summer.\" Tears welled in my eyes thinking of him picking out a ring, planning it, and then doing it in one of my favorite spots. Brooke looked at me with shock written on her face. \"I ruined that, too. I would have been engaged to him. I would have had everything.\" I sat down as I buried my face into my hands as Brooke bit down on her lip. \"Gabi, you made the decision you had to make.\" \"He understood,\" I answered with a quiet voice. \"I didn\\'t even have to tell him why I did it. He already knew. If I would have just told him then nothing would have probably changed, and I would still have it all. I wouldn\\'t feel like an awful human and I would still have the trust of my boyfriend.\" Brooke sighed, \"I hope that you two can work it out. I don\\'t think it\\'ll take long for Troy Bolton to forgive you and trust you again. I think you just need to be overly honest with him.\" I have a supportive smile before I stood up. \"I\\'ll talk to you later, Brooke. Thank you for everything. If Troy and I don\\'t hang very long, do you want to do some more work?\" I asked nudging my head to the court and she shook her head. \"I need to study.\" She told me, and I nodded, \"Let\\'s do a study date then. I\\'ll text you after I\\'m done with Troy.\" She nodded, and I began to walk out with my backpack when I stopped in my tracks. Lauren was standing outside the basketball offices with a grim look on her face. Her hair was tied up high and she was fiddling with her backpack. \"Troy said you were here,\" my breath faltered, and I nodded, \"Why didn\\'t you tell me, Gabs? We\\'ve been best friends forever and you couldn\\'t even tell me?\" My bit down on my lip as I avoided her gaze and then around the area, we were in. This was too public. Too many people. \"C\\'mon,\" I said gently as I searched for a building for us to go into but disappeared into the library before finding an empty room and shutting the door. \"I didn\\'t tell you because I didn\\'t want anybody to know,\" I told her honestly, \"Only one person knew before Troy did. One person.\" Lauren winced at the news, \"It was just her because I needed a ride. She wasn\\'t even a friend before it happened. I was ashamed, Lo. I was embarrassed, and you are so close to Troy too. You would have told Grey and then I would have been forced to tell Troy then and I didn\\'t want to do any of that. If I had it my way nobody would know.\" Lauren shook her head, \"I could have kept it a secret,\" I shook my head again, \"No, Lo, it would have put a strain on you and Grey. It would have ruined you guys. I couldn\\'t do that to you. I ruined my own relationship with it. I was protecting everybody.\" Lauren rolled her eyes, her face pained with the conversation, \"You\\'ve ruined our relationship, Gabi!\" she yelled, and I cringed at her voice. \"I know, I\\'m so sorry. I ruined my relationship with you, with Troy, with Grey. I\\'ve ruined all of my relationships and for some reason, Troy still wants to be with me. For some reason, Grey texted me this morning and checked in on me when I have been nothing but shitty to all of you.\" She laughed and nodded, \"Yea, this is shitty. You were a shitty friend. If that was me I would have come to you!\" I chewed on my lip and I nodded, \"I know you would have. I wanted to come to you, but it was all going back to telling Troy. I couldn\\'t tell Troy. I regret it. I do, I really fucking regret it, but I was scared. I didn\\'t want to see Troy beg for me to keep it because I probably would have and then I wouldn\\'t be in medical school and I wouldn\\'t be playing basketball. I would have hated it.\" \"Troy would have never asked you to do that.\" She said quietly, and I must have been the only one who doubted Troy in that situation. I lowered my head into my hands and I tried to hold back a cry. It released anyways, and Lauren sat on the other side of me. \"I know that now but then I was scared. He had just graduated and took a job. We didn\\'t have money and I was scared that it was going to be exciting for him. The next step in our lives.\" Lauren didn\\'t say anything for a minute and she shook her head, \"Do you even know him?\" I bit down on my lip shaking my head, \"Apparently not in that aspect. I can tell you so much about Troy Bolton but apparently, our future and how I think he\\'ll react to things isn\\'t one of them.\" Lauren swallowed hard, \"He told me he told you about the proposal.\" \"That hurt. I think out of everything, that hurt the most. That I scared him away from doing that. That he knew something was wrong and that I prevented him from wanting to take that step with me. That he had it all planned out and that I ruined it. I fucking ruined it.\" I couldn\\'t breathe as Lauren leaned against me. \"He asked me to help pick out the ring and he knew every single quality of you. He knew everything about you, Gabi. I highly suggest if you are going to make this relationship work, you need to learn everything about him.\" My mouth was like sandpaper and I looked at her. \"What about us?\" I asked, and she sighed. \"I don\\'t know, Gabi. You pulled so far away from me, I don\\'t know if we can fix us.\" I lowered my head and I just nodded because I deserved all of this. I will forever deserve all of this that was happening. \"I don\\'t want to throw away our friendship, Gabi. I just…I\\'m sad that you didn\\'t think I could be there for you. I get it, you were protecting yourself. You were scared. I just wish you would think more highly of everybody around you. I wouldn\\'t judge you for something like that. I wouldn\\'t judge you.\" I nodded, \"I never thought you would judge me. It was just not wanting to put my burdens on the people I love. After I was done, I was really guilty though.\" I was quiet for a minute as Lauren was just staring at me. \"I thought once I did it then it would be over and done with. I would let everything go back to normal but every single time I looked at Troy, I felt guiltier. I was mad that he didn\\'t take a job somewhere else because then I had to see him every single day. I had to feel that rush of guilt every time I looked at him. So, I pulled away from him which naturally meant I pulled away from you and Grey. I hated myself for it and the longer it went on the more I hated everything. The more pressure I put on myself. The more I couldn\\'t stand hurting all of you. I was just hoping that everything could go back to normal but instead, I was grieving and angry. I was sad and emotional, and I couldn\\'t tell anybody why.\" \"But you could have!\" she yelled, and she pulled at her hair. \"I know that now. I know that Troy would have been okay with it and that\\'s all great now, but it doesn\\'t give me back the last six months that I made the mistakes. Yes, maybe, I don\\'t know Troy as well as I thought I knew him but…fuck. Lauren, I didn\\'t make any of my choices lightly. It ate at me daily and there were so many times that I was just going to tell all of you but then I would have to admit my mistakes and saying it out loud was even harder than just dealing with it.\" My chest rose and fell with anger and I couldn\\'t breathe. I was fighting back sobs and I looked at Lauren. \"Admitting to any of you what I did make me anxious. It made me want to just run away from everything because that was Troy\\'s baby. That was my baby. Our baby together and it was made on one of the happiest days of our lives together. It wasn\\'t like I wanted to do it. I had to do it. I had to do what I needed to do for me and at the time I just didn\\'t want anybody to know. I am lost. I don\\'t have my friends anymore. My boyfriend doesn\\'t trust me, rightfully, and I am so fucking sorry to everybody.\" I bit on my lip, \"I am so fucking sorry. I ruined everything.\" Lauren took a step forward and she wrapped her arms around me tightly. \"I just wish sometimes that you weren\\'t as independent. That you would just allow people to make their own decisions. That you would go to people who fucking love you so much. He loves you. I love you. Grey loves you. We all love you so much and if you would have come to us we would have all understood. Troy would have held your hand, I would have been there when Troy couldn\\'t, and Grey would have done everything to support Troy.\" I just held onto her and she sighed, \"You\\'re just so damn stubborn and I am so sorry that you went through that by yourself. I wish you would have let us.\" I pulled away and wiped away my tears, \"I wish I would have too.\" Lauren just nodded, \"I think we\\'ll grow close again in time, I just…I\\'m sad Gabi.\" I nodded, \"I understand. I don\\'t deserve any of you and I tried to tell Troy that, but he wouldn\\'t listen.\" Lauren gave a small smile with a tiny nod, \"Yea, we told him that he shouldn\\'t, but he loves you so fucking much. His love for you never wavered. Troy told Grey and the first thing he said was that he wanted to go after you, comfort you, he loves you. If you let him, he\\'ll be okay. He\\'ll learn to trust you again. I will too.\" I just hugged her tightly. \"I love you, Lo.\" \"I love you too, Gabs, \" I wiped my hands on my jeans as I walked into Rents. Lauren told me that Troy was just going to wait for me there and he knew that she was taking up my time. I walked in and he was sitting in our typical booth reading something on his laptop. He looked up and he spotted me, his eyes taking everything in. Going from my shoes all the way to the top of my head before our eyes held each other. A tiny smile appeared on his face and I felt my stomach warm with happiness. He doesn\\'t hate me. I walked over and slid into the booth across from him. \"How was Lauren?\" he asked quietly, those blue eyes capturing all of my attention. I stared at him and I shrugged my shoulder, \"All of my answers will never be good enough for anybody.\" I said quietly, and Troy looked at me with hard eyes and a tick in his jaw. \"They are good enough for me.\" I swallowed on the lump in my throat as I tore my eyes away from him. \"She said that I should really get to know you because when you were trying to pick out my ring that you knew every quality, every thought, everything and now I feel stupid. Like I never gave you the same attention you gave to me. That makes my heart hurt.\" I said to him and Troy shut his laptop, his hand reaching across from mine. His thumb stroking my skin. \"B, baby, you were stretched thin. Basketball, medicine, working at the hospital for those patient contact hours. We hardly spent time together those two years. I mean, we did but I had more time with you than you had with me…does that make sense?\" I shook my head no and Troy sighed, \"I learned all about you from just watching. I always watch. From the moment we met, I watched you. I learned about you. How do you think I know you want an Iced Vanilla Latte with an extra shot right now? Because I watch, and I learn. I see you do things and I just pick up on them. I\\'ve always been a watcher.\" He bit on his lip and he tilted his head to the side. \"Your brain doesn\\'t ever stop. You are constantly thinking about everything you need to be doing. When I\\'m around you, I can only think and look at you.\" \"Yea, but I should be more mindful of everything. If I would have asked you questions, learned about your wants and needs…I didn\\'t give you the time of day that you did for me. I feel awful.\" His fingers locked with mine and his eyes took me in again. \"You, Gabriella, are a very independent woman and I never want to take that from you. Yes, I wish you would have come to me. That you would have allowed me to be there for you but in the moment, I can understand where your head was. We never had a conversation about it.\" \"But you\\'ve told me time and time again that you\\'d always put me first. Always.\" He smiled and nodded, \"Yea, I\\'m glad you\\'ve finally accepted those words.\" My eyes took him in, his chopped hair that was styled back with a cotton t-shirt with Durham Bulls pasted on the front. His biceps were hugged by his t-shirt and the veins in his forearms were protruding. My mouth watered because it had been months since we had good sex. Since we made-out. Since we just held each other without a barrier. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I whispered to him and he shook his head, \"It\\'s okay,\" he whispered back. \"I would say we should spend more time together and find our way back but…your schedule is ridiculous right now.\" I cracked a tiny smile with a nod. \"Yea, it\\'s a bit crazy right now.\" Rolling my lips together I glanced at the table. Troy shifted, \"Iced vanilla latte?\" he asked me, and I just nodded with a smile because he always got my coffee order right. Always. Troy went up to the counter and I could only admire him in his jeans. They hugged his ass and fuck, I missed him. He laughed, and his Adam\\'s apple bobbed in his throat. I couldn\\'t stop a tiny smile on my face watching him and when he turned around and caught me staring. A smirk rose to his lips and I felt my face flush with heat. I turned around to face the front again as I played with my fingers before a coffee cup landed in front of me with a purple straw and then I felt his lips near my ear. \"Mmm…glad to know these jeans still turn you on.\" His warm breath caused goosebumps down my back. I pulled away and he smiled before sitting across from me again. \"I know you have more questions,\" I said quietly, and he nodded sadly. \"I do.\" He said honestly. His eyes were hesitant, and he sighed, \"Are you really not mad that I took the Durham job?\" he asked me, and I finally let a small smile cross my face. \"No,\" I spoke honestly. \"I was actually excited initially, that you didn\\'t have to go somewhere else and that we could be together. It is a good job and I am so proud of you.\" His eyes flickered to mine and I reached across to thread our fingers together. \"Well, that\\'s really good to know.\" Troy said with a tiny smile, \"It was it really the same day?\" Troy asked me, and I nodded, \"The next day.\" I said, \"I spent the whole day in bed and I still didn\\'t feel good the next day, but you were so happy. I let you talk first, but I felt so guilty. I was terrified, and I could have never ruined your happiness at that moment with my news. I almost told you that day because of the guilt and anger towards myself but I just…I snapped at that. It felt safer.\" His thumb ran over my fingers and I took a deep breath. \"You were so angry.\" He whispered, and I nodded, \"I was. Most of that anger was at me though.\" Troy just nodded, \"Why did you always come over at night?\" he asked turning his head and I sighed. \"I missed you. You never really wanted to talk at night, so it felt safe. Then we just fell into a routine with it. You wouldn\\'t ask questions. We both got to have each other, and that was it.\" \"I would always miss you more after those nights,\" Troy said with a hint of sadness coming over his face. \"Because when you came to me, I knew that you missed me. That you still wanted me. I knew you weren\\'t seeing other people and I don\\'t know. I just wanted you during the daylight as well. I wanted you during all hours.\" The lump in my throat grew as my tongue turned to sand paper. \"I\\'m sorry,\" Troy just shrugged his shoulders. \"We can\\'t turn back the clock. Who helped you?\" my cheeks turned red with embarrassment. \"A freshman on the basketball team. She\\'s now a sophomore. She was there for me.\" Troy grimaced and turned his head away. His jaw ticked a few different times and I then saw the tears in the corner of his eyes. My stomach twisted, and I felt my gut wrench with anguish. I wasn\\'t sure I would be able to handle him crying right now. I just wasn\\'t sure I could do it. \"Fuck,\" he muttered as he rubbed the palms of his hand into his eye socket. \"I think that\\'s what hangs up the most for me.\" He said pinching the bridge of his nose. \"That I wasn\\'t there for you. That you did that alone. If you chose to or not…it hurts me. I can\\'t imagine you alone, in pain, in that emotional state, and if fucking tears me apart that I couldn\\'t be there.\" I went to say I something, but he shook his head, \"I would have held your hand, I would have laid with you in bed, fuck, Gabs, I would have done absolutely anything you wanted me to do. Held you, cried with you, and just protected you from everything. I think that\\'s what I get the most upset about.\" I squeezed his hand and he had two tears run down his face, but he quickly wiped them away. I got up and I went to sit next to him. Mostly, because I couldn\\'t handle seeing his tears. If I was next to him, I could just hold him. \"I wish I could change so many things, but I can\\'t. I know you would have been there every step of the way and would have done anything I needed. I know. I wish…\" he squeezed me close to him and he buried his face into my hair. \"I wish original me would have known that you would have understood because it would have saved so much heartbreak.\" Troy squeezed my knee, \"We are going to get through this. You\\'ve answered any question without hesitation and you are open with me now about it. It might be six months late but…I\\'m here. You\\'re here. I just…I need you in my life.\" I rubbed my lips together and I kissed his jaw. \"I need you, too. I may not act like it sometimes, but the past six months have been me trying to convince myself I don\\'t need you and I couldn\\'t do it. That\\'s why I would come around because I fucking missed you.\" \"Can I take you out on a date tonight?\" he asked looking up at me with pure want in his eyes. I nodded my head, \"Yes, please, can we do it kinda later though? I need to study and do a ton of homework for the rest of today.\" Troy nodded his head, \"Yea, we can do a late dinner and maybe a movie at my place?\" he asked, and I smiled with a tiny nod. \"As long as I get to cuddle with you on your couch.\" Troy grinned with a nod, \"Yea, absolutely.\" There was a beat of silence and I inhaled softly before I rubbed my thumb over his hand. \"Troy, you can be upset with me still. We don\\'t have to move fast or anything. I hid something from you for six months and you were barely angry with me. You just…accepted it but you have the right and I would never be upset with you. I just…I don\\'t want us to be building something false because you never were truly angry or upset.\" I said, and he gave a little flicker of a smile. \"I\\'ve been angry, B. I drank every single night since you told me until I blacked. I\\'ve cried. I\\'ve yelled. I\\'ve gone through a ton of emotions, but I am not going to get physically angry with you. You made a mistake. You owned your mistakes. Gabs, I just wanted to know why you were angry with me and yes, it wasn\\'t what I thought it was and yes, we still have a ton to work out, but it starts with dating again. It starts with finding time for each other. It starts now. I\\'m not going to fume for the next several weeks because it won\\'t change anything.\" He paused while his fingers brushed mine and he made our eyes connect, \"It doesn\\'t change that I love you. I\\'ll never stop loving you. So being angry with you for weeks over something that we can\\'t change is pointless.\" I shook my head, \"I seriously do not deserve you.\" I whispered, and he shook his head, \"No, we both have made mistakes in our relationship. We\\'ve both lied. We\\'ve both had our moments. You know this. It doesn\\'t matter how big or how little. We all make mistakes. We learn. Just from this one thing you\\'ve learned more about me. About your friends. Your coach. You\\'ve learned and that\\'s all I care about.\" I glanced up at Troy and his blue eyes were looking down at me. His eyes fell to my lips and it had been over a week since my lips touched his. Too fucking long. \"I want to take this slow with you, but I can\\'t,\" he whispered before his lips crashed onto mine. I twisted myself in his lap until my knees hit the back of the booth with my thighs on the outside of his. Our lips tangled together and his hands gripping the side of my body. I pulled back because we were in Rents and I let my forehead fall against his. Those blue eyes were full of want but I knew he was pushing that back down. I pulled my lip into my mouth and I smiled softly, \"I miss you.\" He squeezed his eyes, \"I am so glad to hear you say those words.\" I smiled kissing him softly this time before I left his lap. \"I have to go get homework done. Pick me up at 8?\" he nodded, and I bent over one more time for one more kiss. \"I love you,\" I whispered into his ear. He smiled, \"I love you, too.\" I disappeared from Rents with my coffee cup in hand trying to figure out how I was so lucky to get him. I made a big mistake, he shouldn\\'t even think about taking me back. Biting down on my lip, I called Brooke and she agreed to meet at my apartment. Once I got back I began to unload all of my books and papers as I really had to hit it hard tonight. I had a test next week with finals around the corner during basketball season. I exhaled as we were off to the Bahamas for our big Thanksgiving trip. Brooke walked through my door and I smiled, \"Hey,\" I called as I went over calculations again and made sure that I had it all accurate. \"Hi, how did the conversation with Troy go?\" she asked, \"Good.\" I said with a shrug, \"Better than I could ever have imagined. He doesn\\'t want to break up, he just wants me to talk to him and tell him everything. He just wants us to be a stronger couple. I think I am mostly waiting for the other shoe to drop, y\\'know?\" Brooke nodded her head, \"I think that\\'s fair, but I also think he wouldn\\'t hold things back from you either.\" I just shrugged my shoulders as I focused in on my homework. Hours passed before I looked up towards Brooke who was typing away on her laptop. My eyes caught the time in the corner of the stove and I smiled as I couldn\\'t wait to just spend time with Troy tonight. It was long overdue, and I honestly hoped that he would let me sleep over tonight. Not have sex, just to intertwine my body with his and hold on tight. I switched to another subject when my phone buzzed next to me. Grey\\'s picture popped up and I hesitantly answered the phone call. \"Hey Gabs,\" I smiled as it sounded like the old Grey. \"Hi, what\\'s up?\" I asked him, \"I just wanted to check in on you. Lauren said you guys talked this morning and she was pretty beat up over it.\" I played with my pencil and I didn\\'t say anything for a few moments. \"Yea, we talked. It was hard, and I knew that was going to be the second hardest person to keep the secret from, but I didn\\'t want her to ruin your guys relationship.\" Grey sighed, \"I know everybody has probably told you this but you gotta let people decide for themselves, Gabi.\" I bit down on my lip and I wish I could just go back and fix it all, but I couldn\\'t. I was just going to try my best to do better. Be better. \"I know.\" I said quietly, \"I know I ruined and didn\\'t let anybody think for themselves, but I have to move forward. If Lauren doesn\\'t want to be my friend any more than she doesn\\'t have to be.\" \"Lauren will come around. I just…I just think you have to be careful with Troy. You can\\'t break his heart again, okay? Be honest with him. Love him. He was in pain these past several months because he just didn\\'t understand why you were so angry at him. I know he knows now but that doesn\\'t mean that something else will cause that to switch up.\" I bit down on my lip and I just nodded, \"I understand. I feel bad, but I also know that I will and can do better.\" \"I sure hope so, G.\" I smiled as I looked down at my calendar, \"Grey,\" I spoke as I looked over at Brooke with a tiny smile forming at my lips, \"How would you feel about helping me throw a surprise birthday party for Troy?\" I asked, Grey, laughed, \"Now that sounds like a good ass time. Let me see what I can do. You study. Troy said you two were going on a date tonight.\" I smiled, \"Yea, he really is all about giving me another chance.\" \"Everybody deserves a second chance, G. Everybody.\" I tugged on my jeans with a tank-top and a pull of leather jacket. A knock at my apartment door sounded as I grabbed my backpack and moved across to swing it open to reveal Troy in a pair of snug jeans on his hips with a soft Duke t-shirt that was worn and tattered. I grinned, \"Hi,\" I said, and his eyes went down my body all the way to my eyes as those blue eyes were full of want. \"Hey,\" he said, and I pulled him into my arms and then I pressed a kiss onto his lips. \"C\\'mon, let\\'s go get some dinner.\" He said picking up my backpack, he grunted, \"Damn, B, what the hell is in here?\" I laughed, \"Study material. I don\\'t plan on leaving you apartment too fast tomorrow.\" I said with a wink and his face faltered and I shook my head. \"No, not like that, I just…I miss you. I miss cuddling with you. We don\\'t have to have sex tonight, but I just want to spend the night. I figured that would be okay since I typically fall asleep during movies anyways.\" Troy cracked a tiny smile not being able to deny that I do always fall asleep during movies, \"That sounds nice. What time do you have practice tomorrow?\" he asked as we both slipped into his car. \"Not until tomorrow night. Late practice. We leave Monday for our next game.\" I told him, and Troy nodded, \"I just want you to know that I am thankful for you being understanding,\" I said as I fiddled with my hands and Troy sighed softly, \"We can hash this out over and over again, Gabi. I am just going to give you the same answers. The questions I have, I will ask. I am not angry. I am just disappointed and that won\\'t disappear until I can trust you again. Until I know that you come to me for everything.\" I squeezed his hand and I just nodded because from the sound of it, he didn\\'t want to continue that conversation. \"How is your job going?\" I asked him as I wanted tonight to be about Troy. I wanted tonight to be me learning all about him because I had spent the last six months trying to push him away. \"It\\'s going really well. I really love it.\" He said glancing over towards me. \"I am getting to become in charge of more things. Helping players learn how to communicate with the media and they are thinking I\\'ll be in charge of the social media pages next year.\" I grinned, \"Troy, I am so happy for you.\" He squeezed my hands as he pulled into a little place that we both loved to come too. We got out and walked hand in hand towards the restaurant. \"I am so excited that you have a job that you love. I should put out that I would have been happy no matter what you chose.\" Troy smiled softly as we walked in waiting behind another couple to be seated. \"I wouldn\\'t have been happy anywhere else.\" He told me, and his lips pressed to my forehead. Once we were at the front of the line Troy flashed two fingers and he was instantly recognized. The girl was probably in college as she ogled him up and down. Troy became pretty famous after the first final four, an Elite 8 appearance, and then finally winning it all his senior year. He was the center of the Duke Devils basketball team. I tugged on Troy a little bit more, but it only caused a smirk to rise over his lips because he made it known to every single girl to every interact with him that he was seeing somebody. That didn\\'t stop half of those bitches though. She took us to the back table and we both sat down as neither of us truly needed a menu. I ordered a glass of wine while he had a beer. We both flashed our IDs and the waitress walked away. Troy leaned across the table, \"The off season is fairly slow right now, but I am learning a lot. I can\\'t wait until I finally get to share my days with somebody again.\" His eyes pierced mine and I smiled, \"I just hope you don\\'t miss study Gabi because she is in full force. Medical school is zero jokes.\" \"I\\'m here to help you,\" he told me, \"Always.\" I couldn\\'t stop my wide spread grin because Troy and I were really good study partners and I could only imagine how well he would help me. \"Good, because with everything coming up, I want to be able to make time for you but that might be the only way how.\" Troy smiled, \"You know that I\\'m okay with that.\" I bit down on my lip, \"Do you still want me to celebrate your birthday with you?\" Troy\\'s lips flatlined and he shook his head, \"Gabi, I want to spend every day with you. Especially my birthday.\" I knew I was frustrating him to a point, but I just didn\\'t want to cross lines yet. I just nodded, \"I just don\\'t want to overstep my welcome, Troy. I don\\'t want to do anything to scare you away because for the past six months that\\'s all I have been trying to do and I fucking hate it.\" Troy let a brief pained smile cross his face and he nodded. \"Yes, I know. I am vividly remembering the past six months of my life and they were horrible.\" \"Why did you never just let me go?\" I asked him and he took a minute as he pressed his lips together tightly. His hands wrapped around his beer before our food was sat in front of us even more delaying his answer before he met my eye. His blue sparkling eyes looked at me and a tentative smile crossed his lips. \"Because, I was convinced that I could change your mind and that you would see that I was doing it because being here was making me happy. That if I left you here that I would be so unhappy. I didn\\'t make a selfless decision, Gabi. I made a selfish one. I need you. Every single day. I need your smile, your laugh, and you fucking beautiful brown eyes. I need you. When I tell you that you are my number one, it\\'s because I\\'m a fucking selfish man and it\\'s you. It\\'s only you that I want in my life.\" He took a sip of his beer as I was pressed back against the booth. He shook his head for a brief moment before he chuckled slightly, \"You rocked my world, Gabi. I never left because I still needed you. If I was any sane man I would have left months earlier, but I am not a sane man. I am a man in so fucking deep that I can\\'t see past you. I can only see you in my future and by God…you are going to be in my future. I never left because my love for you kept me close.\" I didn\\'t have any words but I could only look at him. My eyes connecting with his and I cleared my throat as I swallowed on the lump that just wouldn\\'t go away. \"The reason I kept coming back?\" I voiced roughly, his eyes coming to mine, \"Because I was just as selfish.\" He shrugged his shoulders as if we both knew that deep down, we both needed each other badly. We were both just too proud to admit it. Troy\\'s POV My fingers brushed through her hair as her head rested on my shoulder. She had fallen asleep within the first thirty minutes of the movie but that was something I was used to by now. Our bodies were covered up by a blanket while I breathed in her deep amber smell that had a bit of a floral string to it. It was intoxicating along with her vanilla shampoo that she used. My lips pressed into her hair while my phone buzzed against my chest. Grey: How did tonight go? He knew I was nervous for tonight. I was nervous because what if things were tension filled and awkward. What if we could never get back to our old relationship that we loved and wanted? Yet, the moment I picked her up, I knew everything was going to be okay. We talked about a few different things but for the most part, we were relaxed. We both had laughs and she asked a lot about me. We talked about my job. We talked about things in the past six months that we both wished the other would have been there for. Troy: It went really well. She\\'s asleep on top of me right now. We watched a movie so that was to be expected. The credits began to roll across the screen as I turned my TV off and I easily scooped her up into my arms. She nestled her head right into my chest and I couldn\\'t help but pull her tighter to my chest. I fucking missed her so much. I only wanted her to be right there every night. I knew I had to take it slow for a little bit, but I knew it wasn\\'t going to be too long before I was asking her to move in with me. I gave zero fuck about her apartment. I wanted her in my bed every single fucking night. I wasn\\'t sure if that was because if I kept her closer to me then she wouldn\\'t keep things from me. I still wasn\\'t sure why in the world that she never asked me, told me, or confided in me within the first couple of weeks. I inhaled deeply as I tugged her closer to me again. I couldn\\'t get her close enough if I even tried. She muttered in her sleep and I kissed her forehead. My phone buzzed on my chest while picked it up to look at it. Grey: Sounds about right. I\\'m glad it went well. Lauren is still torn up about it. I get why she didn\\'t tell Lauren though. Especially if she didn\\'t want to tell you. If she told Lauren, Lauren would have had to tell me and that would have ruined a lot of relationships. I rubbed my face as I understood that part. I just don\\'t understand why she didn\\'t tell me. I was going to get caught up on it over and over again for quite some time. I guess, if I stuck myself in her shoes I would understand the fear of if I did ask her to keep it. Yet, I would never ask her to put her dreams on hold or never do them. It\\'s not like we can\\'t have a baby together in the future. I groaned frustrated before I looked at his text again. Troy: It all would have been a non-issue if she would have just told me. I plugged my phone in and turned off my light as I snuggled tightly with her in my bed. Ignored the next buzz of my phone and I just held onto her. Because at least I had her now. Her sobs woke me up as she had somehow pulled out of my arms, I pushed up on the bed as I reached over for the lamp as I turned it on. \"Gabi?\" I asked quietly but she cried out again while she wrapped her arms around herself. It\\'s when I realized she was dreaming. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she cried out and I gently pulled her up and kissed on her face. \"B, baby, it\\'s just a dream.\" I whispered as I took in her tear strained face as I tried to get her to wake up from her dream. \"Gabi,\" I said a little louder as I stroked her face and then her eyes opened with alert and a sob cracked from her throat. I hugged her to my chest and I rocked her gently back and forth. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she cried again, and I pressed my lips to her forehead. \"What\\'s wrong?\" I whispered, and she began to calm down, but her fingers were still clutched around my t-shirt and I knew she wasn\\'t letting go for a while. \"I have these dreams of the baby asking me why over and over again.\" She whispered, and my heart cracked in half. For six months she had been having nightmares. For six months there was nobody there to comfort her. For six fucking months. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I whispered into her ear, \"I\\'m sorry.\" I just rocked her in my arms until she was relaxed again, \"I hate that you did this alone for so fucking long,\" I whispered quietly into her ear, \"I hate that you didn\\'t stay the night all those times because of this. I hate it.\" She tilted her head back and I wiped away tears from her face. \"I\\'m sorry.\" I told her again and she shook her head, \"I hate it, too.\" I kissed her softly and I laid her back down. She wrapped her arms around my neck while she kept me close. \"The baby is just asking me why I did it over and over again but this time you were there.\" I swallowed on the lump in my throat, \"And you just kept asking me why, why I would ruin our relationship and why I would do this to you. That you wanted that baby.\" I shook my head, \"I\\'m not mad at you for choosing what you thought was best. I am not. I know why, and I understand why.\" I whispered to her quietly. I could feel her heart racing next to me and I just kissed her forehead softly. I just wanted her to calm down. \"I feel so guilty.\" She whispered. \"B, baby,\" I rotated so I could see her eyes and I tilted her face to look right at me. \"You would have been full of regrets if you went down the mom path before you were ready.\" I reminded her gently, \"If you weren\\'t able to do med school and you didn\\'t get your last year of basketball that you worked so fucking hard for…you would have regretted it. I know you would have loved our baby so much as well, but you would have never completely fulfilled your needs in life before going down that path.\" Her bottom lip trembled, and those brown eyes looked at me with an intensity that made my stomach crawl. I let my thumb traced her bottom lip and I placed a tender kiss there. \"You were brave. You had to be selfish. You had to do what you had to do, and nobody can get mad at you for that.\" She pulled on my shirt again and I just held her close to my body. I let my chin rest on her head as I held her in my arms. \"Please promise me you\\'ll tell me. Please.\" I whispered, \"I want to be there for you and I can\\'t go through this again. I can\\'t watch you in pain knowing that you\\'ve had to handle this on your own for so many months.\" \"I will, I promise, I\\'m so sorry.\" She whispered into my chest and I just nodded holding onto her. \"I don\\'t want you to be guilty anymore, B. You did what you had to do. I would have been nothing but encouraging and supportive. Please, understand that.\" She kissed my chest and I just held her until she fell asleep and eventually, I fell asleep myself. Sunday, November 8 th , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV I woke up still pressed firm against Troy\\'s chest as I remember the look of worry on his face last night when he woke me up from my nightmare. It was a constant nightmare I had along with all of the guilt that I had. He held me tight to him until I was ready to talk, and I could see the hurt in his eyes because that I was doing this alone. It was taking a while before it was getting through my head that he was only upset because I did it alone. He hated that I dealt with all of these emotions alone. He hated that he couldn\\'t support me. I inhaled softly as I kissed his chest softly before I pulled out of his grasp. I was still in my jeans and shirt from last night. I took my jeans off and I slipped one of Troy\\'s shirts on as I went into the kitchen to brew coffee. I then opened his fridge and peered in before I pulled out eggs and fruit with a loaf of bread to make breakfast for the two of us. Moving around the kitchen I couldn\\'t help but think to his constant understanding and how much I didn\\'t deserve that. I couldn\\'t keep anything from him though. I had to be open with him from now on because I couldn\\'t handle the pain I was seeing in his features. I hated that he didn\\'t trust me, and he was full of disappointment. I hated that I could wake him up how I wanted to wake him up because he wanted to take this slow and make sure we were with each other. It was all my fault, though. A heavy breath left my mouth as I made over easy eggs when a pair of arms wrapped around my neck easing me back gently against his solid chest. His lips buried in my hair, \"Morning baby,\" he whispered into my ear and I closed my eyes to his voice as I felt his warm body wrap me up tightly. \"Morning,\" I said softly as he pulled back to grab two mugs from his cabinet. I finished the eggs as Troy took over the role of toast making as I made him three eggs and I made myself two. He made each of us toast while I just put the bowl of fruit between us while we slid into the barstools with our breakfast. Troy perfectly made my morning coffee and I thanked him with a peck on the lips. He was shirtless in a pair of gym shorts while he sent me a tiny smile, \"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t lose that touch,\" he said nudging his head towards the kitchen. I smiled as I sipped on my coffee. \"I\\'m going to work out after this…\" he said quietly, and I nodded, \"I\\'m going to get a start on studying. I have so much homework to get done. A few projects to start and of course studying.\" \"Yea, I\\'ll work-out and then run to the grocery store so I can meal prep for this week. What time is practice tonight?\" he asked as we both ate our breakfast. \"6:30,\" I said, \"I\\'ll probably go back to my apartment tonight because I have class pretty early tomorrow morning.\" Troy rolled his lips together and nodded, \"I\\'ll leave behind my class schedule.\" I told him with a smile and he gave a smile back. \"We play at home Thursday night.\" I mentioned casually, and Troy chuckled. \"Your game schedule is in my phone.\" A small smile crept up onto my face, \"I told you, I was excited to see almost all of your games. I\\'m going to try my damn hardest to be at all of your away games. I already booked my ticket to the Bahamas.\" He said, and I couldn\\'t stop my full-blown smile coming over my face. \"Serious?\" I asked, and he nodded as he finished his last bite before taking a sip of coffee. He leaned in close to me before leaning into my ear. \"I\\'m enjoying this year with you, babe. It\\'s all about you.\" I shook my head, \"No. Troy, this year needs to be about us.\" His face softened, and he pulled me into a breathtaking kiss. His lips on mine and he gently eased me into his lap. His erection pressed into my leg as it had been a few weeks, but I knew he wasn\\'t going to let this get too far this morning. \"We\\'re going to be okay, baby. We\\'re going to make it through this.\" I smiled resting my head to his forehead, \"Thank you for breakfast,\" Troy eased me back to my chair to finish my breakfast. I quickly scarfed it down as Troy went to get ready. He came back out with his gym back with a long sleeve Duke t-shirt on with a pair of shorts. His feet stuffed into a pair of worn gym shoes. He then leaned up behind me pressing his lips to my cheek. His stumble rubbing against me as his hand slid on the counter. \"Use it whenever,\" he said as he put a key to his apartment down on the counter. I twisted in my chair to face him with surprise written on my face. Amusement sparked his and he pulled his fingers to my chin tilting my face backwards to make sure our eyes locked, \"No secrets. No bullshit. I\\'m open with you Gabs, that means my door is too.\" \"How long are you going to make me wait to have sex with you again?\" I asked with a whisper and his timber laugh fell from his mouth as he tilted his head back, \"Not that long. I just didn\\'t want to jump right back into our relationship like that. I want to make sure we have a solid foundation. Sex with you will always cloud my judgement on anything.\" He said with a wink and I laughed before I kissed him again. \"I love you,\" my voice spoke as I rested my head onto his shoulder. He pressed his lips into my hair and he let out a heavy breath. \"I love you so much, B.\" So sweet. I hope you guys are enjoying this story! I know I am enjoying writing this story!

PLEASE REVIEW Next update: March 24 th'][Chapter 4] ['Chapter 4 – Birthday Celebrations Tuesday, November 10 th , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV I twisted the key in the lock for the very first time very early in the morning. I had class at 8 and I knew he had to be at work at 8:30 so I wanted to surprise him early. I quietly entered his apartment while I shut the door behind me. The lock turned back into place as I dragged the balloons in behind me while I quietly let them go. I sat his favorite breakfast and coffee on the kitchen counter while I set his present out. My eyes surveyed my work that only took five minutes as the balloons drifted throughout his living room and kitchen. My eyes peered at his bedroom door that was closed as I smiled glancing down at my leggings and sweater with a pair of Converse. I had practice after classes until almost 8 pm but I still had plans for us tonight. I quickly kicked my shoes off before I snuck into his bedroom. I shut the door quietly as I took him in. He was laying on his stomach with one arm tucked underneath his head. The other was curled up next to him as the blankets were rumpled and only pulled to just above his waistline. His back muscles taunted me. A smile pulled to my lips as it was 6:45. I crawled into the bed as I straddled him, and I rubbed his back up and down. My fingers kneading into his back as he let out a moan of noise, I giggled as I tilted down and pressed my lips right above his ear, \"Happy birthday, baby.\" A smile tugged onto his face, but his eyes remained closed. \"Did you use that key?\" he questioned with his rough voice full of sleep still. I laughed as I nodded, my lips pressing into his cheek, \"Yup. I sure did. Figured I should choose your birthday to use it for the first time.\" Troy finally let his eyes open and sleep filled them, \"Hi,\" I whispered as I rolled onto my side and he quickly tugged me against his body. \"23…you\\'re old,\" I said, and he laughed pushing me backward on the bed. \"You\\'ll be joining the 23 club in three weeks. Better be careful.\" I laughed as I kissed him softly. \"Thank you,\" he whispered, and I wrapped my body around him while I kissed him harder. He rolled me onto his body as I straddled him while my lips meshed with his. His hands gripping my hips to keep me close to him. \"I love you,\" I whispered pulling back as both of us were trying to breathe again. His blue eyes flickered over my face while his thumb ran down my cheek. \"I love you, too.\" He kissed me softly again. \"C\\'mon,\" I said as I tugged his hand gently and I pulled him out of bed. He was only in his Calvin Klein boxer briefs framing his ass and it made me want to push him back down into the bed. We went out into the living room and I heard his rumble of a laugh. His arms pulling me back against him and his lips pressing into my neck. \"Did you do this for me?\" he whispered, and I laughed nodding, \"Yea, I did.\" His eyes were looking at the balloons and then landed on the coffee. One arm kept me snug against him while the other hand reached out for his coffee. He took a drink of his coffee and he looked at the breakfast, \"I love it, thank you.\" I turned in his grasp and I let my head rest against his chest. \"I\\'m just lucky that I am right here. That you are letting me be right here because trust me, T. I absolutely never thought you would let me be here again. To celebrate with you.\" He exhaled, and he only kissed the top of my head. \"Trust me, I want you here. I\\'ve always wanted you here. I just hope I have all of you here now.\" His eyes pierced mine and I exhaled at his words and I nodded. \"You have all of me, Troy. No more lies.\" He gave a faint smile before nodding, a serious look overcoming his face as those blue eyes looked directly at me. Keeping me to my word as if I broke it there would be no more us. I was on my second chance and I couldn\\'t fuck this up. \"No more lies.\" Biting down on my lip I looked at his present and then back up to him. The air growing anxious as he took another drink of his coffee. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I spoke with my nerves hitting the top. Troy looked at me with a shake of his head, \"Nothing to be sorry about. I know that we have to get through all of this, but I really appreciate all of this.\" He said waving his arms around. I bit down on my lip as he tugged me closer to him while his thumb did a pattern of my lip. \"I love you, G. I am so happy that you told me everything…finally. That I have you in my life fully again. Don\\'t beat yourself up. Please,\" I breathed with a tiny nod, my eyes closing, and he just held me close to his chest. My arms tucked against him, \"What time do you get out of practice today?\" he asked into the top of my hair, \"About 8,\" I said with a loud sigh of annoyance. He chuckled as he found my lips again, a soft kiss against my lips. \"9 tonight…how about you come over and I\\'ll have some dinner ready for the both of us.\" I bit down on my lip gently while I glanced up at him because I had a test tomorrow, but I wanted to be with him tonight. I took in a deep breath while my eyes held his, \"Yea, I\\'ll be here but I have to get some studying done.\" I said with a sigh and Troy nodded, \"I\\'ll help you study, okay?\" I gave him a relieved smile and he kissed me lightly one more time. \"I\\'m going to get ready, wait for me?\" I nodded as he disappeared, and I fell back against the counter. My heart crumbling that nothing would just magically go back to normal. My eyes focused in on him going into the bathroom with his coffee. I barely deserved him, but I was going to show him that I did. I was going to make him proud to be with me and I was going to make all of this right. I had too. Troy\\'s POV I slipped my badge around my neck as I held my second coffee for the morning. I was wearing a pair of slacks with a collared Bulls shirt. The logo in the corner as I tipped my coffee back thinking back to Gabi this morning. She surprised me, using the key, celebrating my birthday. I was thankful that she had done all of that. I loved that she did it and I loved her. Yet, I hated that I still felt like there was a wall between us. Going to my desk, I released a heavy sigh as I dropped my backpack to the ground. A knock on my door and I glanced up to see my boss, Hadley, standing in the doorway. \"Heard today is your birthday?\" he asked with a raised eyebrow, I just laughed with a nod, \"Yea, it is.\" Hadley turned his head as I booted up my Mac on my desk. \"You still having girlfriend problems?\" my eyes looked up at him with a bit of surprise, but I just shook my head. \"No, no,\" I said with a grimace, \"How did you know about those?\" I questioned, Hadley laughed, this office is a gossip mule. I think Brent started that rumor.\" I rolled my eyes with annoyance. \"Gabs and I did have some problems but we\\'re getting better.\" Hadley just nodded, \"You seem off today.\" I shook my head again. \"Just a lot on my mind. What time is our meeting?\" I asked again trying to redirect the conversation and he just nodded slowly taking me in. Hadley was only about ten years older than me. A wife, two kids, and the whole nine yards. I smiled at him, \"10:30…we\\'ll treat you to lunch today as well.\" I smiled with a thankful nod as he walked out the door. My phone rang as I picked it up, \"Happy Birthday!\" my mom\\'s voice rang through the phone and I smiled, \"Hey mom,\" I greeted with a tilt of my head, \"How has the beginning of your day going?\" she asked, I smiled as I sat down as I began to check my email. \"Oh y\\'know…just working like a normal 23-year-old kid.\" My mom laughed from the other end, \"How are you and Gabi?\" she asked, I hesitated as I looked up at the door. Rolling my lips together, I exhaled loudly while my mom didn\\'t say anything on the other end. \"Troy?\" she finally said, \"We\\'ve hit a rocky spot,\" I told her honestly for the first time, \"she finally told me why she\\'s been so upset with me and I don\\'t know…I\\'m trying my damn hardest to not let it get in the way of everything that I feel for her but sometimes I feel like I don\\'t know her anymore.\" I scrubbed my face with my hand and my mom was really quiet for a few moments. \"What happened, honey?\" I took a deep breath as I closed my eyes. \"She had an abortion in May and just told me last week,\" I admitted as my mom was speechless on the other end of the phone. It took a lot for my mom to have no words. \"Oh, Troy…\" I didn\\'t have anything to add to that, but I tilted my chin up and my eyes settled on the ceiling. \"I was really mad in the moment. I am disappointed and angry with her. Yet, we\\'ve talked about it. I understand her thinking at the moment. I don\\'t agree with it, but I understand it from her point of view. I love her. I really not love her but…it scares me that she\\'ll always hide things from me.\" My mom exhaled loudly, \"You know Troy, I know you love that girl. She is beautiful, and she makes you so freaking happy. I am really shocked she did that though.\" I laughed numbly, \"Yea, that makes two of us. She thought that I would have asked her to keep it. To keep our baby and maybe I would have wanted that but if she would have just explained that she didn\\'t want to do that with her first year of medical school. That she didn\\'t want to worry about it with basketball. I would have understood. I tell her all the time I understand, and I do I just…I don\\'t want to get burned again. I don\\'t want her to hide things from me.\" My mom sighed from the other end, \"Is she trying?\" I closed my eyes, \"Yea, she\\'s trying. Yet we have moments where I\\'m just not sure what to say and what to do. I was going to propose to her, but do I really know her? I\\'m starting to question absolutely everything.\" \"Oh sweetie, I\\'m sorry. I think you just need to let her try for you. Let her come to you and if she can\\'t make the effort then maybe she isn\\'t the one for you but Troy…she\\'s the one for you.\" I breathed back hesitation while my eyes blurred at the computer monitor. \"I need her.\" I breathed out and I titled my eyes to scan my emails. \"I know you do and I think you just keep things open with her.\" A breath of fresh air filled my lungs. \"She\\'s told me she\\'s sorry a hundred times and I know she is. I know she was scared. I know she just wanted to live her life and I know if her situation was different, she wouldn\\'t have done what she did. I\\'m thankful that she told me and that we might be able to move past this, but I\\'m scared now. I love her. So much.\" I paused to let my thoughts collect and I bit on my lip, \"I told her that I would hate myself if I let her go because of this and I have to hold that word to myself. I think I would be upset with myself.\" I breathed with a sigh of relief, \"I think you would too. Just be honest with her Troy. That\\'s all you can do and hopefully, she\\'ll always do the same for you.\" I nodded slowly, \"She did what she needed to do. You aren\\'t mad about that…right?\" my mom asked quietly, and I shook my head. \"No. Absolutely not. She did what she had to do. I\\'m mad she didn\\'t tell me or allow me to be there for her. I just wanted to be there for her. Support her.\" My mom released a little laugh, \"I love you, Troy. She does too. Just give it time.\" \"Thanks, mom,\" \"I hope you have a really great birthday,\" I thanked her again and I hung up the phone as I went to work with my mom\\'s words right on my mind. I did have to give it time. I have to give us time. I love her and that will never change. My love for her will never fade or lessen. We just needed time to return to a new normal. Nothing was going to be the same, but I was going to support her. Love her. I was going to show her that I will always be there for her. I just had to let go of the fact of what happened because it happened, and I was damn sure it wasn\\'t going to happen again. Going back to my apartment, I entered the door to see the balloons and my eyes caught a little note on the counter. I walked over as my eyes took in the present next to the note. I glanced down to see her handwriting and I felt a smile tug to my lips. I hope you had a good day at work. I love you a ton and I bought everything for dinner tonight. I wish I could make it for you but…duty calls. Please, open your present and I hope that helps you know I do trust you, T. I want you to know that I am done running from you and only running towards you with every single piece of news that I have. I know we have our things to work through but knowing that you still want me after everything…proves to me how right I was the very first time I met you. We\\'ve fought harder battles. I know we can do this. I love you, T. I quickly reached for the gifts and I grabbed it as I tore the paper off. My heart exploded with warmth as it was a map of the stars and I knew the location without even thinking. It was a basketball court. My eyes tilted to the date and I smiled as it was from our first kiss all those years ago. Our anniversary coming up before too long in January. Yet, the quote at the bottom was what really caught my eye and what really stuck in my heart. The reality is…people mess up. Don\\'t let one mistake ruin a beautiful thing. I inhaled with ease as I closed my eyes, I loved her, and I was the one who told her that we couldn\\'t mess up what we had because of a mistake. We\\'ve both made mistakes. I picked up my phone to see that she was probably between classes and practice. I dialed her phone number and she answered on the second ring. \"Hey,\" she said, and I could hear the smile in her voice. My heart was warm with just that thought because she was happy to hear from me. After a long six months of her angry voice, it made everything better. \"Hi, I\\'m glad I caught you before practice.\" She let out a giggle, \"I\\'m glad you did, too. I\\'m trying to get some studying done so we can spend time together. I know you thrive off quality time with each other and I feel bad that I can\\'t give you a ton of that,\" my mouth turned up with her rambling. \"Thank you for the gift,\" I told her and she stopped talking, \"Oh…did you like it? I know it isn\\'t a huge gift or anything, but I don\\'t know. I thought it was something we both needed.\" I closed my eyes just listening to her voice. \"B, it\\'s perfect. So perfect.\" I whispered, \"Especially the bottom. I…I said that to you pretty much. Our love is a beautiful thing and I want you to know that. One big mistake will not define us. I love you.\" She didn\\'t say anything for a minute and I knew she was trying to find the right words to say. \"I love you, too.\" She finally choked out and I could hear the tears in her words. \"Go practice hard okay? I\\'ll make us dinner and we\\'ll share a glass of wine together when you get back. Whatever studying you need to do we can do. That is time with you and that\\'s all I need.\" \"Fuck, Troy, stop making me cry.\" I laughed quietly, \"I\\'ll see you later,\" we hung up the phone as I tilted my head backward to let it all soak in. There was a knock on my door and I went over to open it up to reveal Grey and Lauren. \"Hey guys,\" I smiled as I let them both into the apartment. Grey held a bottle of Crown Royal in his hands and I laughed, \"Hopefully for another night?\" I questioned with a laugh. \"What you aren\\'t up for a party tonight?\" A laugh escaped my throat again while I shook my head, \"Nah. Gabs and I are having dinner together tonight. I\\'m going to help her study for a big test.\" I said with a shrug, \"A simple night.\" I felt Lauren\\'s gaze on me and I turned to look at her. Her face was scrunched up with disbelief, \"How do you just forgive her like that?\" My eyes level with hers and I bit on my lip, \"I don\\'t know.\" I said honestly, \"I just knew that I couldn\\'t be mad at her for hiding anymore. She\\'s too important to me. I love her too much for us to throw everything away because of six months.\" She shook her head back and forth. \"She lied to you for months!\" Lauren argued and Grey shot me a look. \"Yea, I know. She lied to all of us for months.\" I reminded her. \"It hurt. I drank. I thought about it. I also realized that if I lost her that it would be worse than her lying to me for six months.\" I said with clarity in my voice. \"Losing her will kill me. I fought for so much to be in a relationship with her and I am not going to just throw everything away because of that. I get it. It\\'s fucking huge and it was terrible for her to do.\" Lauren shook her head. \"Out of all people I didn\\'t think you would have forgiven her so easily.\" \"It wasn\\'t easy,\" I clarified. \"We\\'ve talked a ton. She\\'s been here and explained everything. She didn\\'t run away from any questions. She stood up and answered everything I asked her to answer. She was scared and didn\\'t want anything to stop her from doing what she needed to do. Yes, of course, I wish she would have told me. Yes, of course, I wish I could have been there for her. Yes, of course, I wish I could have known a lot sooner but in ten years when I still have her I won\\'t even think of this.\" Lauren breathed her eyes filling with tears, \"I don\\'t want you to throw away your friendship because of six months. Hell, she was more open and happier with you until the past few months. We have to remember that Gabi chose to do something that was scary, and she doesn\\'t totally agree with. She just has too many other things that she needs to do first.\" Lauren turned, and Grey grabbed her gently, \"Lauren, you have to know she didn\\'t tell you because she didn\\'t tell me. It all rooted to her telling me. It\\'s not that she didn\\'t trust you or that you would judge her. It was that she didn\\'t want to put you in an awkward position with Grey and me.\" Lauren just shook her head, \"But if she would have just told you.\" \"But she didn\\'t Lauren. That doesn\\'t matter anymore.\" I said softly, \"None of the can change what happened. If I\\'m being honest, I wish I could have changed the night it happened and just put on a damn condom. We fell back on her birth control and it failed but if I would have taken the two extra seconds then none of this would have happened. Zero. I was too damn lazy though, so I partially blame myself for putting us in the situation at all.\" A look was shared among the group and a long sigh was released throughout the room. I breathed as I looked between my best friend and my girlfriends\\' best friend. \"You have to let it go, Lauren. I\\'m not saying you have to forgive her. I\\'m just saying you have to give her another chance. You have to let her try again or she will carry this grief with her for the rest of her life. It\\'s not fair to any of us here and it wasn\\'t fair to her. She misjudged our reactions, but she was scared.\" Grey glanced at me with a sense of relief that I was telling Lauren all of this. \"Give it time, Lauren. Just give it time.\" I hugged her and she tilted her head backward and wiping away tears. \"Thank you guys for coming by. I think I can squeeze in a drink before I have to start making dinner for us.\" My eyes moving to the clock and they both agreed as I filled glasses and we cheered to year number 23. Gabi\\'s POV I rushed through the locker room as I changed out of my practice clothes and quickly was taking a fast shower before pulling on underwear, a bra, with a long sleeve dress coming over my head. I slipped on a pair of heels, \"Whoa, Montez, where are you off too?\" I glanced up at Jamie as I smiled, \"I have a hot date tonight.\" I said with a smile blossoming over my face. \"My boyfriend\\'s birthday is today.\" \"Yes, the whole world knows of that gorgeous man.\" She said with a laugh and I smiled again as I threw my dirty laundry into the basket while I pulled on my backpack. \"He\\'s making us dinner and I have another gift that I want to give him. So, I gotta bust,\" I began to move towards the door, \"Montez,\" Coach\\'s P let her voice filled the room and I closed my eyes, \"Coach P, I have to go.\" I said quickly turning to face her and she raised an eyebrow. \"Gabi, I just want to talk for a moment.\" Her face was serious, and I finally just nodded before I crossed the threshold and into her office. I shifted anxiously, \"Are you going out with Troy tonight?\" I nodded my head, \"It\\'s his birthday,\" I said emphasizing the importance of me leaving soon. She nodded her head, \"Your dad asked me if something was going on with you.\" I frowned, \"What did you tell him?\" I asked shifting uncomfortably in my chair. \"That you and Troy were just having some problems but that you were working through them. Getting better.\" I bit down on my lip with a nod, \"Thank you,\" \"I suggest you tell your family.\" I shook my head back and forth, \"No, no, my dad will kill Troy. He will literally kill Troy for getting me pregnant and I just don\\'t want to put that strain on their relationship. Like we are finally in a good spot with their relationship.\" My voice was a constant rumble and fear racing through my veins. \"Your dad highly respects Troy, for fighting for you constantly.\" I felt my face grow pale and the nerves growing in my stomach. \"Coach P, I will think about this, but I owe my boyfriend good night. I owe him a night without us talking about my mistakes. A night about him and if you fill my head with all of this then there will be no night for him and about him.\" Coach P just rolled her lips together with a tiny nod. I bolted from my chair as I raced out of the locker room before she changed her mind. I shot Troy a text that I was on my way and I noted that it was a little after nine. The drive to the apartment wasn\\'t very long as I pulled up and raced up the stairs with my backpack full of study materials along with his other gift. My eyes were trying to focus on the stairs as I twisted the knob. Pushing through the door I smelled the food filling the air. I felt his eyes on me before I even saw him. I dropped my bag and my eyes filled his within moments, but his eyes wandered down my body. They paused at the swell of my breasts that were highlighted by this dress before he slimmed down to my legs that always caught his attention. Those eyes left a trail of fire before he looked right at me. He shifted uncomfortably as he was in a pair of jeans with a snug t-shirt on his body. \"You\\'re fucking beautiful,\" he whispered as he walked closer to me. His bright blue eyes were full of want and desire. He slipped my hand into his as he gently twirled me around. I laughed as he then pressed me back against the fridge. His lips hovered over mine and he gave a soft smile, \"You look pretty damn good yourself.\" I inhaled his cologne and I about fainted on the spot. I breathed him in deeply while I grabbed onto his shirt. All of those rapid feelings of being with Troy came rushing back to me. He finally brushed his lips over mine and then let his tongue wash over my bottom lip as I granted him access. He groaned causing my own groan to rumble from my chest. He closed his eyes tightly before pulling away from me. His hands stayed lock with mine. \"You picked a good dinner.\" He commented, I smiled, \"It is your favorite.\" I teased as he had already poured a glass of wine for both of us and plated two plates of food with a basket of bread sitting in front of us. We took seats to eat dinner together. I loved that we were eating meals together again without bickering. \"How was your day?\" Troy asked me. \"Good.\" I replied, \"I had two of my classes. I really, really love all of my classes and learning about the body deeper and deeper. It is so thrilling and deep in my bones I know I am supposed to be doing this.\" I gushed while I felt his eyes on me the entire time. His full attention. Always. \"After my last class I ate a late lunch, did a lot of my homework, and then I went to practice where I am finally feeling like myself on the court again. I can\\'t wait for our game on Thursday.\" Troy let a soft smile cross his features. \"Now, I am doing what I couldn\\'t wait to do all day today.\" I spoke softly, \"Being with the person I love and celebrating him.\" He chuckled, \"How was work today?\" I asked, and the question seemed to catch him off-guard, but he recovered quickly. \"I had two different meetings this morning and they are officially putting me in charge of all game time social media. I\\'ll be handling the snapchat account, Instagram, and all of those other things for during the game. Helping with the press after the game next season. They want me to go to Florida for a few weeks to help with some of the PR stuff down there for the first couple of weeks before coming back here to get ready.\" I smiled with a glance at him, \"Troy, that is amazing. I am so happy for you.\" I told him with my heart pounding with happiness for him. \"You are going to do amazing things. I\\'m just going to miss when you are gone all the time.\" I teased him, and he smiled, \"Mutual feeling.\" He said with a laugh, \"I miss you the moment you walk out the door though.\" I shook my head at his cheesiness. \"Maybe I can come down for spring break?\" I said shifting to look at him. \"Yes, that would be amazing.\" He said, \"I really do love my job, Gabi. I really love working with the players and working with the press. Getting to run accounts. It\\'s fun. Are you still planning on working this summer?\" I nodded slowly, \"Yea, I am trying to become a scribe for a doctor in the hospital. It\\'ll be a good experience for the summer.\" Troy nodded, \"Look at us…going so many places.\" His blue eyes were full of life and happiness as we ate spaghetti together and chowed through the bowl of bread. Both of our wine glasses having to be filled up again. Once Troy cleared his plate I hopped up as I began to clear the dishes. \"Let\\'s skip dishes tonight. I\\'ll wash them in the morning.\" Troy said towards me and I looked down at the sink full of dishes and then back to him. \"That\\'s not fair. You cooked. I clean. That\\'s how we do it.\" I pressed, and Troy chuckled, \"I know but I want to spend time with you. Not over the sink either.\" I smiled softly, \"I\\'ll do them in the morning. I don\\'t have class until 9:30.\" Troy just nodded as I dried my hands off as he slipped our hands together before leading me to the couch. \"Do you need to study anything?\" he murmured in my ear as he pressed his lips below my ear. Goosebumps traveled down my body and I closed my eyes trying to focus. \"I do but we don\\'t have too. I can just get up in the morning to study.\" I whispered as his hands roamed down my body and then to my bare skin on my legs. My breath hitched in my throat while his hand went up to my thigh. \"Nope. Sorry. I\\'m not letting you use me as an excuse. 30 minutes. It\\'ll be better than nothing.\" He said withdrawing his hand and causing a chill to spread through my body. I grunted, and he chuckled behind me before he kissed my temple. I got up as I grabbed my backpack and one binder as I pointed to him the things I needed to focus on. He quizzed me back and forth as we came up with things to remember them by and we didn\\'t stop until I knew it. My eyes were glassy from the wine and the hour of studying together. My hands pushed the binder away from his hands as I crawled up his body and let my head rest on his chest. His arms squeezed me tightly to him. His lips burying into my hair as he breathed in my scent. \"I\\'m sorry we didn\\'t do anything too fun for your birthday.\" I whispered, and Troy laughed, \"B, baby, you are right here with me and that is absolutely everything I need. That is all I need.\" I felt the tears coming and I pushed off his chest as I reached for my backpack before I found what I was looking for. I took the thin bracelet that was manly, and I held up two. They were both Duke Blue as Troy eyed them with curiosity. \"These next few months are going to be challenging for us. Yet, I was taking a little bit of a mental break the other day and I saw a quote that I really loved, and it made me realize how much you fucking love me.\" I whispered to him as I tilted my head to watch his eyes roaming over my face. \"It said if a person truly loves you will never let you go, no matter how hard it gets.\" I paused with a tiny smile coming over my face. \"And this Troy Bolton is our hard part. This is where we have to dig deep and just hold on and I wanted both of us to have something to remind us of each other constantly.\" I grabbed his hand as I slipped the Pura Vida bracelet over his skin and then tugged on the white strings for a tight fit. He made it look manly as he reached over and took the same bracelet before putting it on my wrist. The gently tug to remind me that he was always tugging me towards him. \"That way, you\\'re always there for me. That way I can constantly remind myself that you are there for me. That you are always thinking of me and putting me first.\" My tears fell down my face and he wiped them away as his face held something that I couldn\\'t describe. A sense of awe, a flash of happiness, and so much want were all across his face. He pulled me close to him and his lips were quickly on mine. The fire behind the kiss almost made me come unglued on his lap right now. His hands caused a trail of fire over my body as I deepened the kiss further. My hands running through his hair as if we couldn\\'t get enough of each other. His hands slipped up the back of my thighs to pull me closer to his mouth. He broke the kiss but let his lips trail over my jaw, down my neck, before he sucked on my collarbone. My head tilted back, and he pulled back breathing hard, \"I want you…so badly.\" He whispered as he pressed his lips to my chest. \"It\\'s only been a week though and I just don\\'t want to rush everything,\" I shook my head as I tilted his head backward, so our eyes met in the middle. \"I\\'m not rushing this.\" I whispered to him, \"Just kissing you like that pushes me over,\" I said with a laugh and he smiled before our lips connected again. This time slower and gentle. \"You\\'re beautiful,\" he whispered pulling away again and I felt my eyes close as I snuggled against his chest. \"Happy Birthday, T,\" I whispered against his chest and he took in a breath of air. \"Thanks, baby,\" \"Go change so we can go to bed. Some of us have to work in the morning.\" I laughed as he pushed me up and I went to grab one of his old t-shirts. I slipped it over my head after taking the dress off, my bra getting discarded before I dove into his bed. He chuckled as he stripped down to his boxer briefs. He crawled into the bed with me as he shut off the lights and he pulled me close. My back pressing against his chest and his lips in my hair. We were both quiet as we just took each other in. Felt each other and I knew how bad I wanted him tonight, I knew how bad he wanted me tonight, but we had to make sure we were okay. Diving back into our sex life wasn\\'t going to be the right thing for us. We needed a solid foundation. Biting down on my lip, I smiled as I linked our hands together as I knew he was almost asleep behind me. He breathed in deeply and I felt the tears well in my eyes with happiness. He didn\\'t give up on me when I gave him every single right too. I gave him every single right to hate me and give up on me. To push me away and for him to leave but he was right here. He never stopped, and he held me close. That I will never be able to thank him for. Wednesday, November 11 th , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV My phone buzzed, and I picked it up without looking as I tucked it between my shoulder while my eyes scanned the page. \"Hello?\" I asked, \"Gabi,\" my brother\\'s voice caused my back to straighten, I had pulled away from everybody when it happened. I didn\\'t talk to my brother or my parents. I didn\\'t talk to Viv. I just pulled away from it all in general. \"Trev,\" I mumbled, \"How are you? I feel like I haven\\'t talked to you in ages.\" I let out a breath of air, \"I\\'ve been busy.\" I commented, \"Yea, I talked to your boyfriend last week and he seemed a bit…defeated.\" Trevor commented back to me, \"We\\'re better.\" I offered quickly, \"Troy and I are much better than we have been in months.\" Trevor sighed, \"That\\'s good to hear.\" The phone went silent between us and it was rare that I kept anything from Trevor and he knew that something happened. \"What\\'s going on, Ella?\" he asked me quietly and I felt the tears burn in my eyes. \"Nothing.\" I said quickly, \"Nothing is going on.\" I said quickly, \"I\\'m fine. Troy and I are a lot better. Everything is fine.\" I said with a rush of words as I kept myself together. \"Ella,\" he dragged out my name and I bit on my lip. \"Look, Trev, I have to study before practice. I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\" I quickly hung up the phone after that as I let my head fall between my knees and I breathed in and out. I was sitting in the basketball lounge when I heard my dad\\'s voice from across the way. I sat up and he entered as he spotted me, a smile crossing his face, \"Ella, how are you?\" he kissed the top of my head and I smiled, \"I\\'m okay.\" My dad let his eyes find mine. \"Haven\\'t seen you or Troy around?\" he questioned with curiosity and I nodded, \"We\\'re good.\" I told him with a smile, \"Really good. I\\'ll tell him to stop by and see you before my game tomorrow.\" I told him with a tiny nod. \"Maybe we can do dinner soon.\" I asked, and he grinned, \"Your mother would love that.\" I hugged him as I closed my eyes just trying to make myself innocent again. He hugged me close, \"Are you okay, Ella?\" he asked as I didn\\'t let go and I bit on my lip as I nodded. \"Yea, just fine.\" Thursday, November 12 th , 2020 Troy\\'s POV I rolled my sleeves to my button-up shirt as I snuck my way back into the stadium as I did just ten days ago. The whole world has shifted since that night and I knew that I could seek out her family tonight. I breathed a little easier as I made my way up the bleachers as I found her on the court. She looked a whole lot more relaxed on the court, too. She was laughing with Jade and another girl, Brooke. My eyes searched out and I found Coach Montez and his wife. Trevor, Vivian, and Wyatt were all laughing as I walked over. Coach Montez let his eyes lift to mine and I smiled, \"Hey guys,\" Wyatt jumped up, \"Uncle Troy!\" he jumped up and I easily picked him up as he wrapped his little body around me. I smiled hugging him close, \"How are you, big guy?\" I asked causing him to giggle, \"Good!\" Trevor smiled at me as did Vivian, \"How are you and Gabi?\" Coach Montez asked eyeing my carefully, I nodded, \"Better.\" I assured, \"We had a nice big come to Jesus talk about our relationship and the last week has been better.\" \"Is she okay?\" Trevor asked me, and I eyed him as I just nodded, \"Yea, she\\'s okay.\" I replied. I looked at the court again to see Gabi take a shot and then she rebounded before her eyes swept the area. She grinned at all of us and my heart eased as I knew we were better just by that smile. I smiled back at her as she went back to work on the court doing her warm-ups. \"Definitely looks better.\" Trevor muttered, and I just nodded, \"Yea.\" We all took a seat as Wyatt sat on my lap. He somehow snuck my phone from me as I caught up with Trevor and Coach Montez. \"Hey…you busy in January?\" I eyed him, and he grinned, \"The rings will be given out during a Saturday home game in January.\" I grinned from ear to ear, \"Seriously?\" he nodded his head with a smirk rising on his face. \"I\\'ll be sending out an email to all of you seniors.\" I smiled as that would be a great day. I was excited for that day already. We earned that ring. \"We\\'ll celebrate that team and then push to do it again.\" I laughed as we both knew he didn\\'t have quite the talent that he needed to win another one yet. They had a good team but not good enough. \"Troy, I have a serious question.\" I looked at Eli as the girls began to get on the court for tip-off. \"Why didn\\'t you go into the draft?\" he asked, and I shrugged as I looked at Wyatt playing on my phone. \"I don\\'t know. Something I didn\\'t see myself doing.\" I said honestly. Eli Montez rose an eyebrow with curiosity, \"You didn\\'t see yourself making millions playing basketball?\" Trevor snorted behind me and I laughed myself. \"I mean that would have been nice, don\\'t get me wrong, I just…I wanted to stay here.\" I said as my eyes found her on the bench as she was bouncing her toes as she listened to Coach P. Her face had grown serious and she took in all of the information. Her shorts were rolled twice, and her jersey hugged her skin like a glove. It took all self-control the other night not to take her to my bed and do everything I wanted to do with her, but we had to make sure we were solid, and she knew that. If I dove back into bed with her, I would be lost forever. \"You wanted to be with Gabi,\" Eli said, and I just nodded my head, \"Yea, and this was before everything fell apart obviously, but I don\\'t know. I just…I don\\'t need fame and fortune. She makes me happy.\" My eyes shifted to him because he knew about the proposal and he never asked why it didn\\'t happen. He figured it out when my visits to his house became infrequent this summer. When she didn\\'t go to Seaside with me. I breathed out as I looked at him with a shrug, \"I\\'m just glad we are figuring everything out because I would have hated myself for losing her.\" Trevor glanced at me as they tipped off and Gabi controlled the ball. If anything was harder for me, it was to watch her play basketball and not need her afterwards. She glided around the court, she could see things before they actually happened, and she was just always in control of the situation. Her voice was the loudest on the court. She quickly scored the first eight points of the 1st quarter while she scrambled around. Always so scrappy. \"Are you still going to the Bahamas?\" Trevor asked I nodded, \"Yea, I am.\" I said with a smile pulling on my own lips. \"She was excited when I told her. I don\\'t know why she doesn\\'t believe that I will do just about anything to be there for her. Be with her.\" Trevor shook his head, \"Too damn independent for her own good.\" He reminded me. I exhaled loudly as I knew that. I really did know that. My eyes watched her move across the court and I knew how badly she wanted to take this team to a championship. How much she wanted it. She could taste it and if they were going to do it...this was the team. \"Troy,\" my eyes met Vivian and she smiled down at Wyatt who had passed out. \"I can take him.\" I shook my head as a TV timeout was called. \"Nah, he\\'s good,\" I said with a smile and Vivian nodded sitting back resting her hand on her belly. She was due this March and they were getting ready to find out if it was a boy or a girl. My eyes looked down at Wyatt as he was curled against me with his eyes shut peacefully. I slipped my phone back into my pocket while I watched Gabi dominate on the court. During another time-out, her eyes lifted to us sitting not too far from the bench and she let her eyes rest on me. She looked at Wyatt sleeping in my lap and our eyes connected for a brief moment. I shook my head slowly because I knew where her head went. It wasn\\'t hard to figure out. Her face fell, and I shook my head one more time to tell her that I didn\\'t want this, not yet. I wanted her. I needed her to do what she wanted to do with her life. Yet, she didn\\'t pay any attention to my head shaking. She only swallowed hard on a lump in her throat and went back out onto the court. Completely unfocused. Gabi\\'s POV Coach P yelled at me for about ten minutes as I almost let that game slip away from me, but I couldn\\'t get the image of Wyatt and Troy out of my head. Wyatt was all snuggled up with Troy and Troy was holding just like he would with our child. I kicked myself again as the tears threatened to spill over because Troy would be a great dad. He would have stepped up. He would have been perfect. My throat constricted as I sat at my locker for another minute. A knock was heard at the door and I glanced up to the empty room. I slowly got up and I went to open the door as Troy stood on the other side. His hands stuffed in his slacks with his shirt rolled up to his elbows. His hair slicked back from work still. He was devastatingly handsome. \"B,\" he said quietly, and I just walked back into the locker room. \"Don\\'t go there,\" he said forcefully, \"Do not let the what ifs carry you because that isn\\'t fair to you. You weren\\'t ready.\" He said, and I kept my back to him as the tears started to spill over. \"You wouldn\\'t be on that court right now if you decided to keep it and do you know what I love to do?\" his voice dropped low and shivers went down my spine. \"I love watching you tear up that court. I love watching you do what you love.\" I closed my eyes tighter trying to will the tears away, but they fell anyways. \"Yes, I want to be a dad one day, but that day isn\\'t any time soon. I love hanging out with Wyatt and I love getting to be his uncle. I love all of that.\" My shoulders shook with the tears and it wasn\\'t but five seconds later that he pulled me back against his chest. His warm touch sending shivers down my spine. \"Do not beat yourself up over this, B. Please.\" He whispered, and I just turned around and buried my face into his chest. He held me close as I cried into his chest and I didn\\'t realize how hard this would be when I chose that path all those months ago. The constant guilt and nerves that wrecked my body. I inhaled sharply with a sob breaking from my throat. \"I got you,\" he whispered into my ear as he sat down on a chair as he pulled me into his lap. His hand stroking my hair as he held me. The man who never walked away even though I have given him a thousand reasons too. \"You, Gabriella, are going to do a lot of amazing things before you have a kid. Somebody out there will be thankful that you became a doctor when you save their life. Somebody will be thankful when they can point to you on a screen to their younger daughter who is 5\\'6 and be like look at this girl play basketball at Duke? She destroys her opponents. You can do anything.\" I hiccupped as I closed my eyes to his words. \"This is what you are supposed to be doing, B. This is where you are supposed to be. If there were other plans for you, then you wouldn\\'t have done it. Okay? Don\\'t do this to yourself.\" \"I don\\'t deserve you.\" I whispered, and he chuckled, \"You might want to rethink that statement because before we can do anything in this relationship before we move forward, you need to tell your family.\" I sat up quickly almost falling off his lap. He tightened his grip on me as if to keep me from running. \"They need to know.\" He said quietly, \"I know you don\\'t want to tell them, but I will be there for you. It will eat you alive if you never tell them. You need to let it go and I don\\'t think you\\'ll be able to do that until you tell your parents.\" My mouth was dry, and I shook my head, \"No, no, if I tell my dad he will freak out, Troy. He will freak out.\" His hand ran down my back and I finally met those blue eyes for the first time since he walked into the locker room. \"I know.\" He said quietly, \"Trust me, I know, but you need too. You need to move on and let go.\" He whispered, and I shook my head, \"My mom will be so upset and…\" I began to breath harder and I struggled to let any air in. \"Hey, breathe,\" he whispered into my ear, \"We will do it together. I will be there for you the entire time. I will never let you do this alone.\" I took in a deep breath and nodded my head as I looked down at my leggings and t-shirt. \"Okay, are they still here?\" I asked, and Troy raised an eyebrow towards me. \"I didn\\'t mean you had to do this today. I was just saying that I need you to do it.\" I shook my head, \"No. I owe this to you. You asked me to do this. I am going to do it right now.\" Troy looked at me and he gently tugged on the bracelet I had finally put back on after the game. \"I\\'m right here.\" He whispered, and I nodded as we both stood up. I grabbed my two bags, but Troy took my basketball bag and swung it over his shoulder as we walked out of the locker room together. My family was still gathered in the lounge and they were all excited to see me. Vivian smiled, and I hugged her first. \"What happened in the 2nd quarter?\" my dad asked as I pulled away from Vivian. \"Uh…\" I bit on my lip and Troy grabbed my hand almost immediately, not going back on his word. Being right here for me. My eyes met with my dad\\'s as tears filled mine, \"I have been keeping something from all of you. I know you guys know Troy and I have been having issues lately. We argued about his job but that was displaced anger. I finally told Troy about ten days ago with what happened and why I was upset and angry.\" The words were like cotton and felt sticky and stuck in my mouth. I tried to swallow but the roughness didn\\'t allow it. \"What happened?\" my dad asked quickly allowing his eyes to jump from Troy to me. So, I blurted it all out. \"I somehow ended up pregnant even though Troy and I take all precautions. It happened, and I had an abortion without him knowing. Nobody knew except one person who helped me there and back.\" My eyes stared at my dad as his eyes tunneled at me as the room was silent around us. I felt the panic well in my chest, \"I didn\\'t know, and I asked her to tell you guys. She has been really hard on herself about the whole thing and I think being there for her is the best right now. You know Gabi has worked so hard to be on this basketball team and to be in medical school. If she would have kept the baby, she would have struggled to do both things.\" Troy\\'s voice was quiet but firm with my family that he was there for me. That he supported me. My dad\\'s jaw clicked back and forth as tears rolled down my face watching him. \"I\\'m sorry you had to do that alone,\" Trevor said quietly, and I was terrified of how he was going to react but the moment he pulled me into his arms I let out a choked sob. He didn\\'t say anything, but he just held me close to him. Vivian pulled me into another tight hug, \"We\\'ll talk later,\" she whispered, and I nodded as I pulled away as neither of my parents had said a word yet. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I breathed out trying to stop my tears, but they wouldn\\'t stop. \"Gabriella,\" my dad finally said, and I winced with his voice. \"Why didn\\'t you tell anybody?\" he finally asked, and I shrugged as I was blubber of a mess by this point. \"I was scared Troy would want to keep it and I thought it would just be easier if I took care of it without telling anybody.\" He circled me into his arms and I cried, \"We could have been there for you.\" \"I figured you would hate Troy and wouldn\\'t approve of it. I was scared.\" He just continued to hug me and then my mom was hugging me. I didn\\'t expect this reaction in the slightest way. When I pulled away I wiped away my tears, but Troy pulled me into his arms this time. A tight squeeze that told me that he was proud of me. I exhaled, \"Now that you all know I am exhausted and just want to go to sleep.\" I whispered, and I began to walk away. \"Gabi,\" I turned to face them again, \"I understand how terrifying that must have been.\" My mom said softly, \"You should have never had to do it alone. I know that you and Troy probably have talked about it a ton and have worked through things, but you could have come to us too. We would have helped you and understood. You have a bright future ahead of you and we want nothing but for you to succeed with that future. If you thought a baby wasn\\'t right, then it\\'s okay.\" I bit on my lip because I didn\\'t want to cry anymore. I was over crying, but I just nodded, \"Thank you,\" I whispered, \"I realize I made a big mistake by not telling anybody. I get that. I am sorry, really sorry, but I can\\'t change anything. You know now,\" \"I love you, Gabi.\" My mom said, and I turned to see her offering another hug as I accepted it. \"We all love you.\" I smiled, \"I love you guys too,\" I looked at me dad as if he wanted to say more but kept it to himself. I just nodded as I started to walk out, and Troy said something but followed behind. \"Gabi,\" he said quickly, I turned to face him, and he gently grabbed me, \"I\\'m really, really proud of you.\" He whispered, and I gave a soft smile with a shrug. \"Do you trust me a little bit more?\" I asked him, and he let a crooked smile fall over his lips, \"Yea, just a little bit more.\" Saturday, November 14 th , 2020 Gabi\\'s POV Grey: We\\'re ready. I guided Troy back to his apartment as he smiled at me as we had dinner and did the big celebration tonight. I didn\\'t have a game or a night practice, so we finally got to properly celebrate. Little did he know…we were really celebrating. He went to open his apartment door and quietly unlocked it, \"I think we are finally getting to have some time with each other.\" He whispered in my ear, I laughed as I pushed the door open as he flipped on the light. \"SURPRISE!\" Everybody hopped out and I watched Troy\\'s eyes grow with surprise and he let out a laugh. I smiled as he was shocked, success. \"Wow, you guys,\" Grey and Lauren were at the front of the line as I gave both of them a smile for the help. Lauren still didn\\'t talk to me, but I think I had to give that relationship time. \"Did you do this?\" Troy asked turning to me and I gave a tiny nod, \"You deserved a night about you. Grey and Lauren helped a ton with everything. God bless them but…yea.\" Troy grinned as he pulled me into a kiss. My lips turned up as he kissed me again, \"I love you, so much.\" I smiled hugging him as he went into the room full of his friends from North Carolina. Grey eyed me, and I smiled at him as I went for a drink. \"I\\'m glad to see that you two look better. I was hoping Troy wasn\\'t feeding me lies.\" I laughed as I mixed a drink, \"Yea, well…things are turning up.\" I said with a smile. \"Now, only if I could get Lauren to talk to me.\" Grey squeezed my shoulder, \"She\\'ll come around. She\\'s hurt.\" I nodded as I saw somebody gave Troy a drink and he was laughing with some buddies from Rents. A smiled crossed my face watching him. \"He was hurt and yet…\" \"That man loves you more than you\\'ll ever understand. I would have been pissed at Lauren. I probably would have freaked out and not talked to her for a long time. Yet, he saw everything with clarity. You don\\'t cloud his judgment. You keep it aligned. He understood, he had his time of anger, and he moved on. He understands, and I hope you understand that. That he is okay with everything.\" I just breathed, and I nodded my head as I took another long drink. My eyes watched Troy celebrate as he deserved too. He deserved this. This birthday celebration was all for him. 23 was going to be a good year for Troy. 23 was going to be the year that I made it all about Troy. No matter how hard my schedule was. Hey Guys! I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I definitely love writing more about these characters! Let me know what ya\\'ll think! I love hearing your opinions and thoughts! Okay...I do have some not so great news. As most of you know, I am in nursing school. So far, I have successfully been able to keep up with writing and school but this next month is woof. It\\'s a little crazy. I have six tests, two huge projects, clinical, simulations, papers, etc. I have a lot with our final five weeks of school that remain so with that being said...the next update won\\'t be until April 24th. I know, that I said I have chapters preplanned for this story and I do but my 100% focus needs to be on school and school alone. I hate that I have to do this but this is something that has to be done. After that, I have three months off from school to write away. I haven\\'t even had time to write to Closer in weeks so I don\\'t have a chapter planned out for that. So...both stories WILL be updated on April 24th and then go to alternating Sunday\\'s with each story after that. Give me ONE month to get my s**t together and finish my first semester and then I\\'ll be right back at it. Thank you for all of the support! I truly appreciate all of my fans and the ones that have been with me for a really long time. I hope you stick it out with this short break! Love you! PLEASE REVIEW (I know, I know, you are upset with me)']","Summary":" ['If you haven\\'t read Coach\\'s Daughter, you\\'ll be highly confused. Go back and read Coach\\'s"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"Nostalgia","Author":"headupheelsdown","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13102189","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['AN: Step in to the future, but hold on to High School Musical. My very first venture into fanfiction was because of HSM in 2007. I\\'m not letting this fandom go anytime soon, so in honor of the 10 year anniversary of the third movie, I\\'m jumping back into it. Just for funsies. And, of course, nostalgia. Gabriella squeezed her phone between her cheek and her shoulder. \"Yes, I realize the inconvenience,\" she said into the receiver. She flicked through the mail in her hands, noticing most of it was still addressed to the previous tenants of her California apartment. \"Thank you for granting me the time off,\" she clicked off of the phone call and pushed her glasses up further on her nose. One envelope was particularly heavy; the return address read East High Alumni Association. She used her monogrammed silver letter opener to tear the envelope. When her mother gave it to her after graduating from Stanford, she thought it was a silly thing to own, but he found herself using it more frequently than she had imagined. Gabriella dumped the contents onto her countertop, unsurprised to see several bits of glitter. She wiggled the paper, dislodging more glitter, so that she could read the brightly colored script. Please join us for a night of Fast Times at East High as we celebrate our 2008 class reunion in classic eighties style! Bust out your leg warmers and walk like an Egyptian on July 18th at 6:00pm. Bring your families the day before for a tour of East High and lunch in the gymnasium. Festivities begin at 11am July 17th. RSVP by June 30th to ryanthedramallama The envelope also contained information on a nearby hotel that had agreed to blocking out rooms for a discounted rate as well as ticket payment directions (a t-shirt would be included!). Finally, there was a red scrunchie wrapped around a small card reading Once a wildcat, always a wildcat! . She took it off of the card and used it to pile her dark brown hair into a messy bun. Ryan had called Gabriella to let her know the date of the reunion a few weeks ago. She should have known that he would still be sending extravagant invitations as well. After much pleading on Ryan\\'s part, she had already agreed to go, and had just had her vacation time approved. She hated taking time off so soon after she started, but as Ryan put it, this was a once in a lifetime thing. He may have also used an outdated four letter acronym about living once. This reunion was his baby, and now that he taught drama for their alma mater, he was very invested in school spirit. During high school, she never would have predicted that Ryan would be the only person she stayed in contact with. Granted, he did most of the heavy lifting, but she always carved out a few minutes for a phone call. When he vacationed with his boyfriend in California last year, Ryan and Mark met her for lunch more than once. It was an easy friendship, and she was grateful for it. She knew that seeing other old friends from high school wouldn\\'t be so simple. Gabriella sat on couch and pulled out her laptop to type out her RSVP. It may be redundant, but she knew that Ryan would want to have her commitment to the event in writing. Afterwards, she cooked pasta for dinner, managing to find the colander after diving into two cardboard moving boxes. Gabriella made a mental note to finish unpacking, but knew that she would keep procrastinating. She would rather put the effort in at work rather than at home. Three years after completing her doctorate, she had finally landed her dream job. SpaceX was an aerospace engineering equivalent to a football team making it to the superbowl. Gabriella had to work at a smaller company for three years and publish four academic papers just to get an interview. By some cosmic alignment, she was selected for the position. Now one month in, she was taking a few days off for a high school reunion. Just thinking about it made her stomach churn. Maybe this wasn\\'t a good idea after all. The mechanical whir of the electric wine bottle opener stopped, and Taylor pulled it upwards. She pressed the up arrow on the device, and soon the spent cork fell from the opening. It landed on the floor with a small bounce. Not bothering with a glass, Taylor wrapped her hand around the bottle and carried it to the living room. The pinot noir slid down her throat comfortingly, warming and relaxing her from the inside out. Keeping the bottle in her hand, she propped her feet on the coffee table and reached for the remote. Within no time she found a trashy reality television show to distract herself with. As of today, she was officially a single woman. The marriage began with people all around; they\\'re closest friends and family gathered to witness the beginning of a lifetime together. All it took to end such an arrangement was herself, her now ex-husband, and a lawyer with his tie too tight. If only that was really the end of it. She took another large gulp from the neck of the bottle, wincing at the realization that this wine was meant to be savored. Maybe she would start keeping hard liquor in the house. As long as she kept it up high enough, Adrie wouldn\\'t be able to get to it. Adrie was four and was the only good thing to come out of the marriage. As of now, she had joint custody with Jordan, and it was his weekend. Though she missed her daughter, she had no idea how she would have handled picking her up from school right after signing the divorce papers. At least she didn\\'t have to worry about legal issues or the fairness of the agreement like most women did. After graduating from Yale, she had been working as a corporate lawyer, so she knew how to properly negotiate and review a contract. This particular contract was too personal, making her feel like a failure rather than a success. Taylor was actually thankful that Jordan had insisted on a third party lawyer draft it. Writing it would have been even more excruciating than signing it. She kept getting lost in her thoughts of self deprecation that edged their way in, unbidden. Thankfully, the wine seemed to be helping. She sipped and watch the show, laughing at the absurd plot lines. Too quickly to be considered ladylike, the wine bottle was empty. Taylor threw it into the recycling bin and grabbed another. When she did, she noticed the pile of mail on her table that she brought in with her. Most of the envelopes were junk mail. A few bills she didn\\'t want to deal with. One postcard from a friend got her attention. Other than that, there was only one left, marked from East High Alumni Association. The invitation was a surprise to her. Ten years had passed so quickly. She remembered it all so clearly, but so much had happened in the time since. It felt like yesterday, but she also felt like that Taylor McKessie was so different than the one she was now. She wondered if that was what it was like for everyone who opened this. As she drank the second bottle, she thought back to her high school group of friends. Other than seeing a few random online updates, she hadn\\'t kept in touch. Her recall failing, she booted up her laptop and started snooping. She found an online presence for several of her old friends, but no one seemed to post much with the exception of Sharpay. She fingered the invitation again, pulling off the red scrunchie and wrapping it around her wrist. Taylor counted weekends on the calendar, finding that Jordan would have Adrie that weekend. Before she could talk herself out of it, she typed out an email to Ryan to say she would be there. \"Troy!\" The door of his Los Angeles apartment vibrated with the impact of tiny fists banging incessantly against the wood. \"Troy!\" He yanked open the door and was met with the perfectly tanned face of Sharpay Evans. \"To what do I owe the pleasure?\" he asked sarcastically. \"Oh, come on,\" She said, pushing past him and into his apartment. Her stylish heels clicked on the tile floor. \"Don\\'t act like you actually had plans.\" Troy rolled his eyes and closed the door behind her. \"You never know,\" he answered, \"People change.\" \"Exactly my point!\" Sharpay said excitedly, waving a brightly colored piece of paper in the air. \"So you should be even more excited for this!\" She was practically bursting with excitement, the color in her cheeks matching the pink of her strappy tank top. He raised an eyebrow, thoroughly confused. \"What are you talking about?\" he asked. Once the words were out of his mouth, he regretted them. He wasn\\'t sure he wanted to know now. Sharpay was always trying to get him to go to awkward parties and showings. Troy ran a hand through his brown hair, causing it to stand up in short spikes. \"East High reunion!\" she screeched, clapping her hands excitedly. Sharpay\\'s blonde hair bounced around her face as she hopped in place. \"Oh, no.\" He dropped onto the couch, resigned. \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"Time to revisit the alma mater, Bolton!\" Sharpay sat beside him on the couch, grabbing his shoulder and giving it a shake. \"You can go. Show them how much you\\'ve changed and all,\" he said with a sweeping gesture in her direction. Sharpay looked like she walked out of a fashion magazine. Her long blonde hair lazily curled in a way that looked effortless, but Troy knew better. She planned her outfits from head to heels. A pop of pink was always visible, but she did so now as more of a personal touch than her over the top style from high school. \"I resent that,\" she answered, pouting her lips. She tossed the invitation his way. He read over it. The damn thing even had a theme. It was hard enough to imagine going back, nonetheless dressed as Michael Jackson. Ten years gave him a lot of time to screw up old friendships and not enough time to try to put any of them back together. If he was honest with himself, that was a lie. He never really tried putting any of them back together. He didn\\'t know where to start. \"I\\'m not going,\" he said. Sharpay threw herself against the pillows of the couch dramatically. She expected the backlash, but it was still annoying. \"You can\\'t skip. You\\'re the basketball star.\" \"Was,\" Troy corrected, \"I was the basketball star.\" He patted his right knee to remind Sharpay. He had no problem remembering. \"Bolton, I am prepared to play dirty,\" Sharpay said sternly. Troy rolled his blue eyes, anticipating what was coming. \"I\\'m cashing it in,\" she said, referring to a favor he had owed her for years, and there was no way he could deny her. Troy muttered a curse, knowing he was beat. Troy looked back at the invitation, turning it in his hands. \"Fine. But, you\\'re buying my ticket,\" he said. So much had changed in the last ten years. He wasn\\'t where he thought he would be, or doing what he imagined he would. Maybe that was true for everyone. It was easy to have dreams and make plans in high school. His plans took a hard left turn, but for others it could have worked out. Chad may not be playing professional basketball, but he was coaching a solid college team. He had a hard time picturing Taylor quitting law school or Zeke giving up baking. Gabriella was smart enough to do anything. Sharpay smiled triumphantly. \"This could be the start of something new!\" Troy shook his head at the irony of her words, recalling karaoke at a ski lodge on New Year\\'s Eve. AN: If you care to stick around, leave a review and subscribe.'][Chapter 2] ['AN: Here is another dose of nostalgia for those of us who can\\'t/won\\'t/don\\'t grow up. Enjoy and leave a review! Gabriella dropped her luggage and wrapped her arms around Ryan. He hugged her tightly, lifting her slightly off of the ground before releasing. \"Gabby!\" he said, kissing her on the cheek. He grabbed her suitcase, and she picked up her carry on. \"How was your flight?\" \"Crying baby. I swear, that\\'s the best birth control,\" she joked. \"Uh oh,\" Ryan said, \"Is there something we need to talk about?\" He put her bags into the trunk of his grey sedan. Gabriella just laughed in response and hopped into the car. Ryan knew that she was single and had not so much as had a date recently. As they drove out of the airport, they exchanged pleasantries and Gabriella asked about Ryan\\'s boyfriend, Mark. Last year, they had moved in together, and Gabriella was staying in their guest room for the trip. She reminded him that she didn\\'t want to impose, but he insisted that she was more than welcome. \"So, do you need any help getting things set up for tomorrow?\" She knew that Ryan was having a little too much fun planning the reunion, and probably had an entire binder dedicated to the event. He was also overly particular and would insist on being there to oversee everything. \"That would be just wonderful. You know, so many people volunteered to help last month, but then had sudden changes in plans,\" he said, shaking his head. Ryan began rattling off the things on his to do list. Apparently, making the welcome bags was on their plan of fun activities this evening. \"Is there going to be a big turn out?\" Gabriella asked, feigning general curiousness. \"About one hundred twenty people out of our graduating class of three hundred thirty-six,\" he paused, waiting to answer the question that Gabriella was really asking, \"Troy said he\\'s coming.\" Gabriella swallowed hard and nodded. \"And Taylor?\" Her voice sounded high to her own ears, but she hoped Ryan didn\\'t notice. Ryan smiled softly. He definitely noticed. \"She\\'s coming, too. Chad, Jason and Martha, Zeke and his family, Kelsi, and Sharpay, of course.\" Gabriella asked about each person in turn, and Ryan rattled off the details he knew. It seemed like he had miraculously kept in touch with everyone. That, or he was the godfather of social media, which seemed a little more likely. For most people, a lot could be garnered from online profiles, but she was not part of that crowd. After her breakup with Troy, it was just too much to handle, and she deleted her online presence. It wasn\\'t like she had time for friends anyway. As Ryan continued talking, her mind wandered, creating dozens of crazy scenarios of how her reunion with Troy would pan out. Chad bounced his knee under the table, his nerves growing out of control. When he sent the message to Taylor, he didn\\'t expect her respond. He definitely wasn\\'t expecting her to suggest meeting for lunch once she arrived in Albuquerque. His thoughts were a jumble. What time is it? He was as anxious for her to arrive as students were when they waited for the final bell on the last day of school. Chad\\'s knee hit the bottom of the table, jarring the silverware with a loud metallic clang. He wiped his sweaty palms on his knees and kept them there in an order to still his movements. The bell above the door sounded, and he looked up to see Taylor enter the diner. She glanced around the space quickly before finding him. Meeting his eyes, she smiled broadly, her cheeks round and high. Even with his hands on his knees, the bouncing started again. Taylor was beautiful, as always. She wore her hair differently now. It circled around her head in tight black curls, framing her face. Her smile was wide, with nude lips and bright teeth. Excitement was clear in her dark eyes. Taylor was never one to be nervous. When she got to the booth, she hesitated. Neither of them knew what to do. Chad wanted to wrap her in a hug, but it had been years. Maybe that would be too much. A handshake would be too formal. Taylor made the decision for him, just giving him a small awkward wave and hello before sliding into the opposite side of the booth. \"I haven\\'t been here in years!\" She spoke with a sense of wonder as she looked around the diner again. \"I even checked online to make sure it still existed.\" \"Oh, you know this town. We never let anything go,\" Chad said without thinking. He moved to correct himself, \"Well, I mean, except you.\" \"Except me,\" she repeated quietly. \"I wasn\\'t the only one though.\" Her tone changed quickly, changing the direction of the conversation. \"We all scattered.\" \"True enough. Ryan and I are the only ones left in town,\" Chad said. The waitress came by, taking their drink orders. As Taylor looked over the menu, Chad searched for something to talk about. She used to be the person that he told everything to, and now he was about to talk about the weather. Thankfully, she spoke first. \"I like your hair short. You look very… grown up,\" she said, placing her menu to the side. Chad rubbed his hair across the top of his head nervously, as if he needed to remember what his haircut was. \"Thanks. That\\'s the look I was going for.\" She chuckled, not knowing how serious he was. Since he got his job on the coaching staff, he had been keeping it shaved short, just the beginning of curls growing. Most of his players were going for the long hair and man buns, and it made him self conscious of his own. \"So, give me all the details, Coach,\" Taylor said. Chad smiled, and told her about his team. He loved playing for the Redhawks in college, and coaching was all that he had imagined. He was an assistant now, but he could move up when the position opened. He\\'d rather wait for the spot at U of A than go anywhere else. Taylor wasn\\'t surprised by any of this. He always had clear goals. Hoops all the way. From the expressions on his face, coaching made him even happier than playing. As she expected, he volleyed the question back to her when he finished. She smiled and showed him her cell phone. A picture of her daughter, Adrie, was on the screen. It was the picture from the beginning of her summer soccer league. \"She takes up most of my free time.\" Chad smiled at the photo before returning his gaze to Taylor. \"I heard through the grapevine that you were a mom. What\\'s her name?\" \"Adrie. She\\'s four.\" \"They let four year olds play soccer? The ball is almost as big as she is!\" He laughed heartily. Taylor laughed. \"Don\\'t tell her that!\" Taylor talked about Adrie easily, describing her bright personality and endless energy. She didn\\'t mention Jordan, but Chad checked her bare ring finger. He could put two and two together. When their food came, they changed topics, discussing her job as a corporate lawyer. Chad found her just as fascinating and driven as she had always been. He told her as much. Taylor blushed, pushing her hair back behind her ear. Over a shared slice of pie, the last of the awkwardness faded, and Chad found himself smiling more than he had in years. Troy resisted the urge to knock and opened the door of his childhood home. He knew if he did, he would get the lecture from his mom about always being welcome, or if he stopped by more often, and so on. He announced his presence, and his mother called from the kitchen. He followed the sound of her voice to see her placing a casserole dish on the counter. Lucille quickly removed her oven mitt to give him a hug. As always, she held on a little too long. \"Good to see you, too,\" he said, chuckling. Lucille let him go and stepped back, leaving her hands on his shoulders. \"What\\'s all this?\" she asked, brushing a hand against the hair on his chin. He\\'d let it grow out just past being stubble, less than a week. He put his hand over hers and brought it down, stepping away. Lucille shook her head and returned to her cooking. \"Your dad is outside. Go say hi,\" she encouraged. Troy did as she asked, making his way to the back porch. He found his father in a deck chair drinking a light beer. \"Hey,\" he greeted. \"Cooler is over there,\" Jack said, pointing. He had always preferred his beer on ice rather than from the fridge. \"How was your flight?\" \"No problems,\" Troy answered. He twisted off the top of the bottle, taking a large gulp before sitting in the chair across from his dad. \"How was the season?\" \"Knocked out in the third round of playoffs. We can\\'t seem to get any further than that the last few years,\" Jack answered. He was still coaching at East High. In three years, he would be able to retire, but Troy doubted that he would. Coaching was his passion, and he would do it for as long as he was able. With so many years in at the school, his teaching schedule was light and he spent most of his days in the gym. \"How\\'s that big kid from last year? Finally get him to start using his size?\" Troy asked. Basketball was a safe conversation, unless it was his basketball career. Or lack thereof. \"Some. He\\'s a great post now, but most of that is since he\\'s still got a good six inches on everyone we play. If he gets against someone his own size, he\\'s gonna have to step it up,\" he answered. \"No one will match him like that until college. Those coaches can handle it.\" \"Basketball talk already?\" Lucille interrupted, poking her head outside. She rolled her blue eyes that matched Troy\\'s. She told them that dinner was ready, and there would be no talk of basketball at the table. With basketball not an acceptable topic, the conversation stuck to the superficial. As with most family gatherings these days, a significant amount of time was spent giving life updates and current events. Jack was coaching a select basketball team for the summer. Lucille joined a new book club with some of her friends. Troy\\'s latest project was wrapping up, and the next one started in a week. After the meal, Troy cleared the table and followed his mother back to the kitchen. Falling into an old routine, she washed and he dried the dishes. With Jack in another room, Lucille started to play hardball. \"Anyone special lately?\" she asked, trying to act as though this question hadn\\'t been burning in her mind for hours. \"No,\" Troy answered shortly. His mother gave him a hard look, and he buckled, offering more. \"I do go out, Mom. But, just coffee or drinks. No one special.\" He said the last word mockingly. Lucille noticed his teasing, and faked splashing the soapy water at him. \"You\\'ll see Gabriella at the reunion tomorrow and Saturday.\" He nodded. Troy pushed the towel across the plate, thinking. His mother was always meddling in his love life. He used to think that it was because he spent so much time with Sharpay that she thought something was going on between them. Now he was more inclined to think it was just a thing that moms did. \"Have you talked to her lately?\" Lucille asked, prodding. Having finished the dishes, she dried her hands and leaned back against the counter. \"No. Not since,\" he paused and tapped his right knee absently, \"about seven years ago.\" Lucille pursed her lips and looked thoughtfully at her son. \"Does that make you nervous?\" Troy sighed. \"Mom, I really don\\'t want to talk about this right now,\" he protested. \"Fine,\" she said, \"But, you will tell me after?\" She put a hand on Troy\\'s shoulder. Her voice was kind, and her hand was lightly patting him. His mom had been his rock his entire life, but they had grown increasingly closer since the end of his basketball career. What used to be the thing that bonded him to his dad now strained that relationship, and pushed him closer to his mother. As he healed after his ACL surgery at the start of his junior year, his mom camped out with him, watching trashy television and crappy horror movies. When he forced Gabriella away, she was there, too, listening to his heartbreak. Wanting to make his mother happy, he said, \"I\\'ll think about it.\" AN: Thanks for reading! :)'][Chapter 3] ['AN: Back at it! I\\'m trying to time the updates to three weeks apart. I am pinky promising you devoted HSM lovers that I will keep on schedule until this is over. I\\'m looking at 10 chapters. Gabriella fidgeted, rolling the red cellophane paper between her fingers. She had rearranged the welcome bags three times. The entry table only offered so many possibilities, but she still had forty minutes until the lunch started. Ryan\\'s guest room came with a cost. He had woken her bright and early to lug boxes full of decorations to the East High gym. She flattened tablecloths, placed centerpieces, and hung photographs. Ryan had made copies of yearbook photos from their senior year in black and white tones. It fit the throwback theme, but it also made those times look as far behind her as they felt. There were several photos from musical productions. Ryan was showing his bias, but most of them did not include him. He chose pictures of everyone else. Sharpay was in many and several focused on Kelsey. There was a collage of group shots taken after production or behind the scenes. The smiling faces of Taylor, Zeke, and Ryan were intermixed with the grins of Chad, Jason, and Troy. Troy drew her eye in every picture. He was captivating and she barely recognized herself beside him. They all looked so happy in each and every photo. She remembered the connection she felt between them all and the security she felt by having a support group. Gabriella hadn\\'t had that since. She finished hanging the photographs quickly, trying not to relive each memory that they brought swimming to the surface. With a final glance around the gym, she walked out. She found Ryan on his phone outside, arguing with the caterer. Gabriella walked the opposite direction before he saw her. Nervous energy fueled her feet. The chain link gate to the track was open and the pressed rubber bounced lightly under her steps. Maybe walking a few laps could tame the itch under her skin. Gabriella focused on the toe of her shoes. She willed her thoughts in another direction, away from high school and musicals and Troy. The sound of her footsteps was not enough to drown out her thoughts and insecurities. Doing the math quickly, she noted that it had been seven years six months and sixteen days since she had last seen him. New Year\\'s Day during their junior year of college. The day before marked five years since the night at the ski lodge when they sang together. Since it was holiday break from classes, Gabriella had been with him at his parents. They waited for the clock to strike midnight. His parents had already went to bed, leaving them to watch the countdown to the ball dropping alone. The silence that stretched between them was not in anticipation of the new year. It was awkward. The strain was palpable, heavy enough that Gabriella had the sinking feeling that the new year was marking the beginning of the end. When Troy\\'s phone calls and texts became fewer and far between afterwards, she knew that he had felt the same way. Neither one of them actually said the words to finalize the break, but their relationship faded away. It set a new pattern for her. Meeting new people and making friends had never been her strong suit. The fizzling relationship with who she thought was the love of her life lessened her motivation to try. If by chance Gabriella managed to make a friend, she was apprehensive to put in the effort. This made most of her friendships temporary and born of convenience. Moving to a new apartment and starting a new job was easy since she didn\\'t have many ties. Ryan was the only friendship that stood the test of time, and that was speaking to his extraordinary dedication, not hers. He was easy to love, and she always looked forward to his calls. Spending this week with him would be more fun if there wasn\\'t the stress of the reunion. She completed three laps before Ryan found her. He blocked her path. When she looked up to his face, he was shaking his head at her. \"Is someone trying to make a break for it?\" Gabriella let out a deep breath and smiled. \"Circles would definitely not be the best escape route.\" Ryan laughed and hooked his arm through hers tightly. \"I\\'m not taking any chances.\" Sharpay enveloped her brother in a hug, pressing her small frame against him excitedly. She had to catch a cab from the airport to her alma mater. With her filming schedule, fitting in the reunion was a tight squeeze. She made it work and was glad to see her brother. \"Shar!\" Ryan almost squealed her name. \"I\\'m so glad you made it! How are you?\" He hugged her again. \"Fantastic.\" Her pink painted lips were stretched wide in a smile. Ryan began talking animatedly. She listened eagerly, nodding and prodding at the right places. He had done a great job with the place. The caterers were setting up food that smelled wonderful and the decorations were tasteful. When she complimented this to Ryan, he didn\\'t take the credit. Instead, he pointed across the room to Gabriella. Sharpay hadn\\'t noticed her when she walked in, and it was easy to see why. Gabriella was about as far from the entrance as was possible in the gym, adjusting a centerpiece that already looked perfectly centered. Her attention was literally pulled away with a tug on her arm. \"I knew it had to be you! How did you get away from LA?\" was all she heard before being enveloped in a crushing hug. When she was released, she could see the grinning face of Zeke Baylor. He must have been blessed with amazing genes or a secret moisturizer because he looked like he hadn\\'t aged at all. Sharpay was surprised to know that Zeke had been watching the show. It was very strange to realize that people who knew the \\'real\\' her also were familiar for the fictionalized television character she played. But, because of the viewers, A Girl\\'s Best Friend had been renewed for a second season. \"We start shooting season two on Monday, so I had a weekend off.\" Before Sharpay could ask for an update on his life, a woman appeared at his side. She was a petite brunette and the baby balanced on her hip made it hard to believe she wasn\\'t toppling over. \"She wants you,\" the woman said. The baby reached out her arms towards Zeke. \"Sharpay,\" Zeke said, \"This is my wife, Jennifer.\" She passed the baby and shook her hand. \"And this little miss is Isabella.\" He settled the little girl in his arms, bouncing softly with an ease that showed his love. \"She is beautiful,\" Sharpay said, focusing on the baby\\'s big eyes and curly hair. \"So this is what you have been up to!\" \"I don\\'t know how he makes time for everything else.\" Jennifer smiled at her husband lovingly. \"Tell her the news!\" Zeke returned her smile with only a twinge of embarrassment. \"When Isabella was born, I started making her food. Once the other parents at daycare saw, I was making it for the whole neighborhood. We pitched it to an investor last week. They want to make Miss Mash a real brand!\" The excitement in his voice was contagious, making Isabella and Sharpay join in. \"Congrats!\" The little family was all smiles. It was obvious that the news was recent. \"Did you bring some with you?\" a voice interrupted. Jason had the same floppy dark hair as he had in high school. His \\'City of Albuquerque Water Utilities\\' shirt was stretched tight the beginnings of a pot belly. A toddler was holding his hand, looking around three years old. When he noticed Sharpay, he gave her a hug with his free arm. \"Martha! Look who I found!\" Jason called out to the crowd coming in the doors. Martha joined the group. Her curly hair was in a messy bun and she also held a baby in some contraption over her front. Martha, Jason, and both kids were all wearing matching red wildcat shirts. Sharpay was introduced to the little ones and the conversation flowed back and forth between everyone. Troy had pulled into a parking lot that was much more crowded than he anticipated. Reunions felt outdated in an era of social media, but it looked like most of the class had shown up. He wiped his palms on the leg of his jeans before getting out of his car. Rather than walking directly into the lion\\'s den, he took the sidewalk looping around the gym. The door to the locker room was just as he had left it ten years go, metal and painted red with a dent right under the handle. He had no idea how it got there, but it had compromised the lock. Troy twisted the handle down and jiggled it a few times before jerking it back up sharply. The hinges squeaked as it opened. The locker room had been repainted. It was still a mass of red and white, but the colors were brighter and fresher. The lockers along the wall were brand new, completely different from the one with a BOLTON nameplate that used to be there. Troy wound his way through until he found what was still his father\\'s office. Through the window, he could see that the decor hadn\\'t changed much. There was a picture of his dad in uniform from his high school days and a picture of Troy with number 14 on his chest. Between the two photographs was a large golden trophy from the 2008 championship season. He looked away and hurried out. It would have been easier just to go right in. Basketball was never his entire life like it was for his dad or for Chad, but it had always been a part of him. He played from elementary until college. After his injury, he lost so much more than he expected, more than just basketball. It became a bitter subject, causing him to avoid his father. He didn\\'t know how to cope. Troy became narcissistic and bitter. He was immature and did not handle it well, chasing away most of his friends. Especially Chad and Gabriella. Now, it was time to face those same friends. Immediately upon entering the gym, Ryan greeted him warmly. His friendship with Sharpay had caused them to cross paths more often the last few years. Ryan moved on to the next guest and Troy funneled in. He found his old team quickly. They were in a group, talking animatedly and laughing. Troy was apprehensive to approach, but they saw him first. He was waved over to many excited calls of his name. Jason gave him a bear hug, almost picking him up in the air and making everyone laugh. He bumped knuckles with the other guys, including Chad. Since his dad was still in town, most of them knew what he was doing with his life. The Bolton\\'s were a East High family, even if Troy had been in California since graduating. Troy didn\\'t have to explain himself or field questions about his basketball career. Catching up with the boys was easier than he imagined. Zeke and Jason were proud dads, mentioning their families with joy. Chad looked happy even without the bulb of curls on top of his head. He was polite and amiable, but Troy felt the difference. The easy camaraderie they used to share was not there. Taps on a microphone stopped conversation and brought everyone\\'s attention to Ryan. \"Welcome back, Wildcats! Thank you for bringing your families and remembering that we\\'re all in this together,\" he spoke into the microphone. Troy didn\\'t hear anything he said after that. Gabriella was standing beside Ryan, and the sight of her made his breath catch and his mind go blank. She wore glasses now. The black frames suited her well, accentuating her large dark eyes. Her hair was long, blocking her red shirt and almost reaching the waistband of her jeans like it had when he met her. As if she felt his gaze, she looked his way, locking eyes with him. Troy couldn\\'t look away. She looked away after a couple pregnant beats. Ryan must have said something about the food being served, because everyone around Troy started to move, shuffling towards the buffet line. People blocked his view of Gabriella and left him alone in the center of the gym. AN: Next chapter will have our Troy and Gabriella reunion. How do you think it will go? Thanks for reading and don\\'t forget to leave a review!'][Chapter 4] ['AN: Tardiness is my specialty this update. Within the time of posting Chapter 3 to right now, my husband got promoted (yay!), I found out that we are pregnant (double yay!), and we will be moving to a new state for his job (stressful triple yay!). So I\\'m holding on tight to smiles and sanity, so your continued patience, readership, and reviews are even more special right now. Onto the next! Gabriella found a spot at a table between Kelsi and Taylor. She caught up with Taylor quickly, slipping back into old habits. Chad and Ryan joined them as well. Between bites, Kelsi told the group about her latest compositions. She was writing music for Broadway shows and living in the big apple. Gabriella had never been to New York, but from what she had always heard, that town could eat someone alive. Kelsi was far from death. She was glowing with excitement, and had even gotten engaged in February. She showed off the ring and gushed to Taylor and Gabriella about the upcoming nuptials. Gabriella tried to focus on the conversation, but her thoughts and her eyes kept drifting towards Troy. He was making his way towards her, but kept getting stopped by classmates. He balanced his plate and spoke politely before extracting himself each time. When Troy finally made it to the table, he sat across from Gabriella. He smiled and blood rushed to her cheeks, heating them as she smiled back. She was saved from an attempt at conversation by everyone else at the table who immediately pulled Troy\\'s attention. Chad fist bumped him from the opposite end of the table, stretching over the table and dangerously close to everyone\\'s food. After all of the reintroductions, there was an awkward silence. Gabriella kept looking at Troy before darting her eyes in another direction. He knew that now was not the time for that conversation. \"So, I heard your name in LA the other day. You\\'re killing it,\" Troy said to Kelsi, breaking the stalemate. \"Our last production had some great scenes that were perfect for some of the scores I\\'ve had stuck in my head,\" Kelsi deflected the compliment. \"Several directors I know are talking about trying to steal you from Broadway. We need some fresh talent behind the keys in L.A. Background music for scenes is sounding a little too background if you know what I mean.\" Kelsi nodded. \"No way. I couldn\\'t even imagine leaving!\" She grinned from ear to ear. There was no doubt that she had found her place in the world. \"What are you doing hanging around directors?\" \"I\\'m an assistant location manager for Paramount. I help the directors and producers find locations to film that match their ideas for the scene.\" This was news to most of the table. Ryan had told Gabriella that Troy was working in Los Angeles, but she didn\\'t know details. Gabriella swallowed hard, forcing the lump out of her throat before speaking. \"That sounds like fun.\" Troy grinned, realizing how long it had been since he heard her voice. He still loved the sound of it. \"It is. I get to travel and see a lot of SoCal that I didn\\'t even know existed before,\" Troy answered. \"I just moved to Willowbrook for my new job. There\\'s so much to do around there that I\\'m overwhelmed.\" Gabriella didn\\'t mention that she had scarcely been out of her apartment to try. \"We haven\\'t filmed much around there, but there are several locations we use regularly down at Manhattan Beach. It\\'s a favorite among the romance movies,\" Troy smiled crookedly and shrugged his shoulders. \"All of this makes my life seem incredibly boring,\" Taylor sighed. Gabriella elbowed her in disagreement. \"Bring out the pictures. You know you want to.\" She smiled knowingly as Taylor pulled out her phone. She flipped through a few pictures before passing it around to show off her daughter. Chad looked like he hadn\\'t aged at all as soon as Gabriella saw him with a basketball tucked underneath his arm. He pointed back and forth, dividing the portion of their group that was playing into two teams. Gabriella preferred to be part of the audience to the action, so she found a bench near the court to watch. The sound of the ball hitting the pavement echoed as they started to play. Taylor kept pace with Chad as he dribbled, playing defense. Troy wasn\\'t on the court. When Chad suggested the game after everyone finished and cleared their plates, he had ducked away quickly and quietly. Gabriella watched as disappointment showed on Chad\\'s face, but none of them really expected him to play. Still, they had hoped and Troy not wanting to play was a reminder of the time that had passed and the rifts that had been created in the group. Back on the court, Taylor managed to steal the ball away from Chad as he was attempting to pass. Taylor turned quickly, tossing the ball to Jason. Jason then sent the ball towards Ryan. With three steps, Ryan made a basket with a solid left-handed layup. His team cheered and offered high fives. Chad yelled across the court to his teammate. \"Get\\'cha head in the game, Zeke!\" \"Hold the phone,\" Zeke said, spreading his arms wide to stop the celebration, \"Where did you learn how to do that?\" Ryan laughed and batted away his question with a flick of his wrist. \"You know, a lifetime of dance lessons makes that little number a piece of cake.\"\\' Zeke mumbled in response as Chad assured Ryan he wouldn\\'t have the opportunity to repeat his skill. They passed the ball in and kept playing. Gabriella kept watching, noticing how well the boys played together even after years of not playing on the same team. They were the staples of the operation, but Ryan, Kelsi, and Taylor were holding their own. Kelsi tried for a three pointer, laughing as the ball ricocheted off of the far corner of the backboard. Jason caught the rebound as it was headed straight for his face with significant speed. The bench shifted as Troy sat beside her. He sat quietly, inches separating their knees from each other. Gabriella resisted the urge to hold her breath, reminding herself that fainting would not be a good start to this weekend. After a few moments, Troy sighed heavily. \"You know, I\\'ve never liked to watch basketball.\" Gabriella turned to him and raised an eyebrow in question. \"So no March Madness?\" He laughed. It didn\\'t sound right to her ears, too tense. \"I\\'m surprised you know what that is,\" he said. \"Watching it makes me so nervous. I feel like I\\'m on the bench, waiting to go in. I see which players are weak on the other team, or who would be the best pass option.\" \"You definitely couldn\\'t coach then,\" she said, thinking of Troy\\'s father and Chad. \"Oh, God no.\" Troy shook his head vigorously. \"I\\'d be running out onto the court to just do it myself.\" Gabriella watched as he gripped his knee as he spoke. She wondered if he even realized he was doing it. \"How long did you have to do physical therapy?\" she asked. He had the knee surgery about a month before their split. Troy looked down at his hand and brought it to rub the back of his neck instead. \"Too long,\" he said. His blue eyes stayed on the court in front of them as he spoke. A beat later, he continued \"I was a bad patient. I never did the stretches or exercises like I should have.\" \"I\\'m sorry it took so long,\" Gabriella said. She angled her body towards his in an effort for him to feel the sincerity of her words. The injury itself was the least of the pain for him. She knew that it hurt him most to leave the team and lose the sport that had defined him. \"Thank you, but it was my fault.\" Troy met her eyes intently. \"I didn\\'t put in the effort. I didn\\'t try hard enough.\" Gabriella\\'s breath caught. The way he was looking at her, his eyes sorrowful, drawing her in like they always had, made her feel like he was talking about more than his recovery. \"Troy,\" she said, not daring to break eye contact. \"Bolton!\" Chad yelled, causing them to both startle and spring apart. The basketball came flying towards them. Troy caught it quickly with both hands. \"Think you can still beat us in Knockout?\" Troy stood from the bench and passed the ball to Chad. \"I know I can,\" he teased. He looked back at Gabriella and smiled before extending his hand and dragging her onto the court as well. Martha watched as her husband played basketball with his former team. She knew it had been years since he had been on a court, and it showed. Jason missed two shots in a row, giving Troy a chance to make his first shot and knock Jason out of the game. When he walked away from the action, he spotted his family across the grass and waved. From this distance, it almost looked like it could have been an afternoon from a decade ago. It had always been easy for her to imagine that this is exactly how things would have ended up. High school doesn\\'t last forever, but she always thought that these friendships would. It was even more shocking that the married couple within the group was herself and Jason rather than the power couples of the halls. Chad and Taylor at least looked to be friendly compared to the awkward energy that pulsed between Troy and Gabriella. Ryan was knocked out of the game next, followed by Gabriella and Zeke. Kelsi and Taylor were doing surprisingly well, focusing and making their first shots with careful calculation. Neither of the girls could keep it up long enough to compete with Chad and Troy. With two little ones, Martha made her way over to the court. Troy finally missed a basket, the ball bouncing off of the rim. As he hustled to go get his rebound, Chad capitalized on the opportunity and made his next shot. The previously knocked out players erupted in cheers. Troy made a dramatic show of throwing his basketball into the grass, making everyone laugh. A toddler interrupted the celebrations when she ran to Jason. He scooped her up, holding her with one arm onto his hip. When she noticed how sweaty he was, she struggled to get free. The group watched, amused, as the little girl ran back to Martha and the baby. \"Well, I guess we better get these two home,\" Jason said, gesturing to the kids. He started telling everyone goodbye. Martha hugged Kelsi, Taylor, and Gabriella in turn. \"Don\\'t worry, we have a babysitter for tomorrow night!\" Jason and Martha broke off from the group as everyone parted ways.'][Chapter 5] ['Troy paced, his feet moving him restlessly about the room. The day had went well. He was expecting more drama or more awkwardness, but the family lunch went smoothly. Feeling the space between himself and Chad was the worst part. He had a lot to fix there. Seeing Gabriella was a rush. She knocked the wind out of him. She was so beautiful. The guilt he had in his heart over their break up should have make it harder to be near her, but her presence was still just as intoxicating as it had always been. He was already anxious to see her again and it had only been a few hours. Troy felt like he had said too much at the same time he knew he didn\\'t say enough. Gabriella needed more than just words from him, he knew that. But, an actual conversation would be a start. The reunion party was tomorrow night, and rather than half-yelling his feelings to her over the music, he could hopefully convince her to meet him tonight. It was selfish. It had only been a few hours since lunch. He wanted more time with her. At this point, it felt like a need. Troy was already imagining how tomorrow night would go in his head, spinning so many scenarios that his head looked like an over-edited script. Troy turned his phone in his hand before pulling up her contact. He started typing a text. It\\'s Troy. I was wondering if... He deleted the words. She would still have his information. His number hadn\\'t changed in years. It was silly starting with his name. It was great seeing you today and I was hoping... Erasing the text, he hoped for the days of flip phones so that he could close it roughly in frustration. Screens didn\\'t offer the same satisfaction of smashing down a real button or snapping it closed. Would you like to go to dinner with me? Chickening out again, he deleted the text just as a knock sounded at the door. His mom poked her head into the room with a smile. \"I can hear your footsteps from the living room,\" Lucille said. She looked at his still moving feet pointedly. Troy made an effort to stand still. He now remembered that his room (now a guest room) was right above the living room. \"Sorry, I was just, uh, thinking.\" His mother gave him a knowing look, the shade of her blue eyes matching his. \"About the reunion, or the people there?\" Troy rubbed the back of his neck instead of answering. \"Maybe just one person there, hmm?\" \"Is it that obvious?\" Troy laughed in a self-deprecating way. He sat on the bed roughly. The mattress shifted as his mother sat beside him. She put her hand on his arm. \"Only to your mother.\" \"God, I hope so.\" He took a deep breath. \"I want to ask her to dinner tonight.\" \"Then ask her.\" \"You make it sound so simple.\" She squeezed his shoulder affectionately. \"You two were very close for a long time. If you want to get back to that,\" she paused to look him in the eyes, \"then you need to get started.\" Troy sighed as his mother left the room. She was right. He had so much history with Gabriella. So many firsts. Asking her out the first time after their break up would just be another one. Dinner at Saggio\\'s? Before he could add anything else to the text, he sent it. Troy clutched his phone tightly, waiting for her reply. Ryan ripped the cellophane wrapper off of the popcorn packet. \"I hope big name actresses still like the extra buttery popcorn!\" Sharpay laughed from the living room. \"Calories don\\'t count on vacation!\" After the popcorn cooked in the microwave, Ryan put it in a bowl with two handfuls of M&Ms.; \"Snacks provided. What\\'s the movie?\" Sharpay had a stack of DVD cases in front of her and the cabinet filled with more was open in front of her. Ryan watched as she finally narrowed it down to Mamma Mia! and put the disc in the player. As the movie played, they snacked on the popcorn and sang along to every song. For two people that had been properly trained and performed songs on numerous stages, their talents were less than obvious during the titular song. Between songs, Ryan kept asking Sharpay questions about her life in LA. Most of the questions centered around a certain ex-basketball player, and she knew that he was trying to get information for Gabriella. It was striking how the group had rearranged itself. Of course, she was still close to her brother, but they were no longer mistakable for the same person. Ryan had found that he loved sharing his joy of performing more than he enjoyed the act itself. His life was full of the eager energy of the students he taught, the doting love of his boyfriend, and the comforts of their hometown. Sharpay almost envied it. The hustle and competition of being an actress in one of the world\\'s largest cities was daunting, exhausting, and not for the insecure. Thankfully, she had never struggled in that regard. If confidence was key, she had it. And, soon enough, she would get to have the career she dreamed of. All the warm and fuzzies were going to have to wait. As she answered Ryan\\'s questions, she realized that most of her warm and fuzzies came from Troy. She quickly cleared up that there was no romance there. It was more camaraderie in battle. They spent their time in the trenches together, and they were both starting to rise out of it. Troy was getting contacted more and more frequently about location scouting, and A Girl\\'s Best Friend was getting a second season. With Troy, they could always celebrate each other\\'s successes without ever being in competition. Making friends with other up and coming actresses never ended well because they would always end up auditioning for the same role and hurting feelings. Her friendship with Troy was easy and comfortable, and he was a great guy. Ryan should already know this. \"Ryan,\" she said, \"I know what you\\'re doing.\" She waved a finger between their heads, referencing their twin connection as if it was what gave him away. He smiled softly and chuckled. \"Then just tell me what I want to know!\" \"He isn\\'t dating. In the last seven years, I\\'ve seen him talk to so few women that he\\'s basically a eunuch. Troy likes to act like it\\'s some kind of focus tactic.\" \"Sounds like he might still be hung up on someone…,\" Ryan let his sentence drift off. \"You said it,\" Sharpay pointed at her brother. \"Not me! Do not let him think that I told you that!\" Ryan laughed and they turned their attention back to the screen for \"Super Trouper\". Gabriella walked down the stairs to find Sharpay, Ryan, and Mark singing \"Take a Chance on Me\" with exuberance. When the song ended, they all shifted their attention to her. She watched as each one of them drank in her appearance and came to their conclusions. \"Well, your sense of style hasn\\'t changed much,\" Sharpay said. Gabriella was wearing a patterned sundress in reds, yellows, and blues that fell to her knees. Her hair was curled lazily to her waist. Mark insisted that she do a twirl, and when she did, the low back of the dress was revealed. \"Or maybe it has,\" Sharpay amended her previous statement. \"So am I safe in assuming that someone has a date?\" Ryan asked. \"No,\" Gabriella\\'s blush betrayed her answer, \"I\\'m just going out to dinner.\" \"Dinner,\" Ryan repeated, \"Should we wait up?\" Sharpay and Mark laughed lightly with him. Gabriella told them all a hurried goodbye. Thankfully, Troy\\'s black sedan was pulling up and she could escape quickly. She got in and shut the door quickly. As Troy pulled away, she looked back to see the living room curtains moving. \"Prying eyes?\" Gabriella nodded. \"You\\'d think they had no lives at all!\" \"I got the same looks from my parents as I left the house. I felt like I was right back in high school, that white truck and everything.\" \"Some things never change, do they?\" Gabriella realized the possible implications behind her words only after she had spoken them. Rather than making it worse by trying to wiggle her way out of the situation, she held her tongue, trying to wait out the awkwardness. Troy changed the subject, and Gabriella found it easy to talk with him. The dim light of passing street lights illuminated his expressive face. He was going on about how Zeke and his wife looked like they belonged on a magazine cover. They had moved on to discussing Martha and Jason\\'s adorable kids by the time they entered the restaurant. Gabriella found herself looking at him more than listening to him. She made a conscious effort to focus. Over a shared pizza, he answered her questions about what exactly a Hollywood location manager does. He was much more talkative about his job than anything in his personal life. Troy shied away from her question about a girlfriend and directed the conversation back to her. \"I\\'ve never been the greatest at relationships,\" she said, ignoring the contradiction to her words that was seated directly across from her. \"Doesn\\'t always mesh well with the plan.\" \"The plan?\" He chuckled and it made her feel self conscious. \"What\\'s the plan?\" \"Same as yours.\" She tried not to make her voice sound defensive. \"Land the dream job, get an apartment without a roommate.\" He nodded. \"So, you\\'ve found it then.\" \"What I\\'ve been looking for?\" She thought of her new job and her apartment waiting for her back home, full of boxes, but no roommate. \"Yeah, I guess I have.\" Even to her own ears, her words sounded hollow. She had it all. At least, she had what she had been working so hard towards since middle school. Her job was stimulating and difficult, already challenging her mentally. Gabriella was in a position to learn everyday, to strive for more and accomplish amazing things. Troy was more honest than she was. \"I\\'ve still got a ways to go.\" He seemed to speak of the empty places she was trying so hard to ignore. AN: I know this Troyella date might not have been as perfect, slip into old habits, favorite pair of jeans as some of you may have wanted, but our duo has to work back to that. And they will! Pinky promise. I have had a couple reviews about Gabriella being too perfect, so I hope you\\'re starting to see where her character struggles. Each of our wildcats has something to work through, and some are more obvious than others. Anyway, thank you for your patience and continued love of HSM. This is the halfway point for this story, and we will be picking up the pace!']","Summary":" ['AN: Step in to the future, but hold on to High School Musical.

It was the end of school at East High and Kelsi Nielson had placed her music at the piano and started to play. \"So lonely before... I\\'ve finally found... What I\\'ve been looking for... Ooh, oooh, oooh oooh… \"Ow!\" she heard a voice shout. Kelsi looked up to find Ryan Evans tangled in a music stand. \"Goodness, Ryan! I didn\\'t see you - you were so quiet!\" said Kelsi. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yeah, I\\'m good,\" he said, getting up again. Kelsi made herself comfortable again. \"So,\" he said. \"Is that the infamous duet that was written before Sharpay rearranged it?\" \"Yeah,\" said Kelsi, nodding. \"Except you joined in with organising the rearrangement as well, didn\\'t you?\" \"In my defence,\" Ryan said. \"Sharpay actually contacted our rehearsal pianist before consulting me first. In all honesty, that was why I did those jazz squares during the performance. I said that it was a crowd favourite, but actually, it was because I wanted to annoy Sharpay!\" Kelsi smiled as she straightened her music. \"Can I hear it all?\" he asked. Kelsi\\'s eyes widened and slowly, she nodded.'][Chapter 2] ['As the first verse began, Ryan took a quick breath. \"It\\'s hard to believe, that I couldn\\'t see, that you were always right beside me,\" he began. \"Thought I was alone, with no one to hold,\" Kelsi continued, \"but you were always right beside me.\" They turned to face each other. \"This feeling\\'s like no other, I want you to know...\" they sang together. \"That I\\'ve never had someone, that knows me like you do,\" they both sang. \"The way you do...\" \"I\\'ve never had someone, as good for me as you... someone like you...\" they sang. \"So lonely before, I\\'ve finally found... what I\\'ve been looking for...\" they finished. \"Ooohhh, ooohhh, ooh ooh...\" Kelsi ended. They looked into each other\\'s eyes, smiling. \"Wow,\" said Ryan breathlessly. \"That\\'s... really nice.\" However, unbeknownst to them, they already had an audience looking through the window. Taylor was there, eyebrows raised.'][Chapter 3] ['It was the day of the callbacks, and somehow, Troy and Gabriella had managed to get there on time. Ryan and Sharpay stood at the side of the stage, wondering what was about to come. After watching Gabriella and Troy singing for a little while, Ryan\\'s eyes left the pair and fell on Kelsi, sat at the piano. As Troy and Gabriella ran towards the piano, Ryan\\'s mouth dropped as Kelsi stood up, smiling and singing along. \"More than hope, more than faith,\" Troy sang. \"This is truth, this is fate, and together,\" Gabriella continued. \"We see it coming,\" they both sang. \"More than you, more than me,\" Troy belted out. \"Not a want, or a need,\" Gabriella sang. \"Both of us breaking free...\" they sang together. As they reached the end of the song, Ryan continued gazing at Kelsi, smiling. Sharpay put her head next to his, following his gaze all the way to the piano. Frowning, she clicked her fingers in front of Ryan\\'s eyes. \"Hey!\" Sharpay snapped. \"Yes, what?\" Ryan asked, coming back to earth. \"Wake up, dreamer!\" Sharpay said sharply. \"Um, right, I\\'m back,\" he said quickly, dragging his eyes away from the piano. Sharpay frowned at him. He did confuse her sometimes. It was like he was in a totally other world watching that performance. That is, if he was even watching that performance. His eyes seemed to have been on Kelsi during most of that. Unless... Had she worked out who her brother was interested in...?'][Chapter 4] ['It was a couple of weeks after the winter musicale, and Sharpay had invited the Wildcats round to the Evans\\' house for a Christmas party. To Kelsi\\'s disappointment, Ryan was out doing Christmas shopping and couldn\\'t make the party so they were minus Ryan for the night. \"Shall we put on some music? Maybe some Christmas stuff?\" Martha suggested. \"I have a better idea! Let\\'s do Truth or Truth!\" Sharpay said. \"Is this basically Truth or Dare but without the dares?\" asked Jason. Sharpay nodded. \"I think I\\'ll sit out of this one,\" Kelsi said. \"I hate the sound of this!\" \"My house my rules, Kelsi!\" Sharpay stated. Groaning, Kelsi joined in the circle, dreading what was to come. \"Okay then… Gabriella, your most embarrassing moment,\" said Zeke. \"Well, I think slipping on milk and throwing my lunch all over Sharpay a while back is a major competitor,\" said Gabriella. Everyone laughed. \"Martha, your most embarrassing moment,\" said Troy. \"I think trying to do a backwards flip, failing and spraining my hand in front of the entire school has to win there,\" laughed Martha. \"Kelsi… oohh! I know! In all honesty, are you crushing on Ryan?\" said Taylor. \"Say what?\" Kelsi asked, mouth falling open in shock. Sharpay laughed at Kelsi\\'s reaction. \"Now that\\'s a good one!\" Sharpay said. \"C\\'mon Kelsi, don\\'t act like that!\" \"I\\'ll happily do an embarrassing moment question, Taylor!\" Kelsi said quickly. \"No way,\" Taylor said. \"You heard what I said, Kelsi!\" Sharpay nodded in agreement and Kelsi put her head in her hands. \"Can we take that as a yes, Kelsi?\" Gabriella asked, smiling. Kelsi curled up in a ball. \"Now that\\'s sweet!\" Martha laughed. Without warning, Sharpay got out her phone. \"What are you doing, Sharpay?\" asked Kelsi, sounding worried. \"I\\'m texting my brother, of course!\" Sharpay laughed. \"That\\'s the advantage of being the oldest twin! I can get him to do anything!\" \"No!\" shouted Kelsi, trying to grab Sharpay\\'s phone. \"Come on, Kelsi! Live a little!\" said Sharpay. \"Don\\'t you want to be happy?\" \"Yes, but I know all you\\'re going to do is laugh and embarrass me!\" Kelsi said. \"Actually, I\\'m not,\" replied Sharpay. \"Why?\" Kelsi asked. \"You should\\'ve seen his face when those two were singing at the call backs,\" Sharpay said. \"All he was doing was watching you. I could barely get a word out of him! Whenever I tried to say anything to him, he either ignored me or gave me two word answers!\" \"Maybe he was just daydreaming!\" Kelsi tried to suggest. \"No way!\" Sharpay stated. \"I know my brother, and he wasn\\'t daydreaming!\" \"Please don\\'t, Sharpay!\" Kelsi pleaded. \"He doesn\\'t feel the same, I know it! He will laugh and I\\'ll be a laughing stock at school on Monday!\" \"Yes he does feel the same!\" Sharpay said. \"Again, I know my brother, and that is why he won\\'t laugh at you!\" \"STOP IT!\" Kelsi shouted. All of a sudden, she ran into the ensuite bathroom, closing the door and locking it behind her. The Wildcats stared at each other in shock at what had just happened. \"Well,\" said Jason. \"That\\'s an issue.\" Sharpay unlocked her phone again. \"I know exactly what I\\'m going to do,\" she said quietly. \"Are you gonna text him?\" asked Troy. \"Of course I am!\" Sharpay muttered. \"And I know exactly what his reaction is going to be.\"'][Chapter 5] ['Meanwhile, at the shopping centre, Ryan stood looking at the pink shirt that Sharpay had showed to Ryan weeks ago when they were out shopping. All of a sudden, his phone beeped with a message from Sharpay. \" To my baby brother,\" he read. \"You\\'d better come home RIGHT NOW xx\" \" Why?\" he typed back. \"Are you ok?\" \" Oh yes, I\\'m fine,\" he read. \"I think it\\'s a certain other person that you should be concerned about xx\" \" What do you mean?\" he replied. \" Well, now that you finally ask,\" Sharpay\\'s text continued. \"We were playing Truth or Truth and we were finding out quite a few things about each other xx\" \" Just get to the point, Sharpay,\" he typed. \" We found out something very interesting, actually. About you xx\" \" Sharpay, I said GET TO THE POINT!\" Ryan replied . \"What on earth are you on about?\" \" Our lovely Kelsi was asked if she has a crush on you xx,\" Ryan read. His heart started pounding at what had happened. \" What? What did you do that for?\" he replied. \" Don\\'t blame me! It was Taylor who asked it! xx\" Ryan read. Suddenly, he was interrupted by a voice near him. \"Are you alright there, sir?\" asked a person wearing a badge which showed that he worked at the shop. \"You look a bit worried.\" \"Oh yeah, I\\'m fine,\" he said quickly, forcing a smile. \"Nothing to worry about!\" At that moment, another text came through. \" Basically, she totally freaked out and locked herself in the toilet! xx\" \" Is she ok?\" he typed, eyes widening. \" What do YOU think?\" he read. \"I think we all know what this means! Come back now, baby brother! Run if possible! Xx\" Without a moment\\'s hesitation, he dropped the shirts he was holding straight on the floor and sprinted through the store. \"Oi! Hat-boy!\" he heard a voice yell. \"Don\\'t you dare leave those on the floor!\" \"You work here!\" he replied, quickly turning round to face the man who worked in the shop. \"It\\'s your job! Sorry, but I\\'m in a rush here!\" He smiled and continued to run. This was what he hoped. Not Kelsi getting locked in the toilet, no way would he hope that, but the thought that Kelsi liked him was exactly what he hoped for.'][Chapter 6] ['Out of breath, Ryan finally opened the door to Sharpay\\'s room. \"Well you took your time!\" Sharpay hissed, pushing him. \"If you must know, Your Royal Brattiness, I\\'ve sprinted for an hour straight!\" Ryan glared at Sharpay, pushing her back. \"You two, stop bickering!\" Gabriella said. \"This is the last thing we need!\" Ryan nodded and walked over to the bathroom door. Hand shaking slightly, he knocked a few times on the door. \"Kelsi?\" Ryan asked. Suddenly, he heard a gasp coming from the bathroom. \"R… Ryan?\" he heard a voice say quietly. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Can… can I come in?\" he asked. \"No,\" Kelsi replied. \"I just want to talk to you,\" he sighed. \"Why isn\\'t talking like this good enough?\" Kelsi asked. \"Because I don\\'t think speaking through a locked door is a good way to talk when I say what I want to say to you,\" Ryan said. Sharpay smiled, knowing exactly what Ryan meant. Gabriella\\'s mouth dropped open and she began to fidget excitedly. \"What, that you can\\'t wait to laugh at me?\" Kelsi asked. \"Kelsi, in all honesty, I will find a way to force this door down if you don\\'t open it now,\" smiled Ryan. \"Now that\\'d be romantic!\" Martha whispered to Taylor, who nodded in agreement. \"I can\\'t,\" Kelsi sighed, tears running down her face. Ryan\\'s eyes narrowed as a lightbulb came on in his mind. All of a sudden, he stepped back and the Wildcats looked puzzled. \" It\\'s hard to believe, that I couldn\\'t see,\" Ryan began to sing. \"That you were always right beside me…\" Kelsi stiffened behind the door as she listened to what Ryan was doing. \" Thought I was alone, with no one to hold… but you were always right beside me…\" Ryan continued to sing. Gabriella smiled. \" This feeling\\'s like no other… I want you to know…\" Sharpay grinned broadly at Ryan. She knew that Ryan loved this kind of thing. It was his favourite thing in movies. \" That I\\'ve never had someone that knows me like you do… the way you do…\" Ryan sang. Kelsi\\'s eyes widened and her stomach churned. \" And I\\'ve never had someone, as good for me as you, someone like you…\" Ryan crossed his fingers as he heard movement behind the door. \" So lonely before, I\\'ve finally found… what I\\'ve been looking for…\" Ryan finished singing. \"Ever the romantic,\" Sharpay smiled fondly. Slowly, the door unlocked and Kelsi opened the door. \"I\\'m sorry,\" Kelsi sighed. \"Why?\" asked Ryan, walking into the bathroom. \"I\\'m sure the last thing you wanted was getting that text from Sharpay,\" she said as Ryan closed the door behind him. \"Why would it be the last thing I wanted?\" Ryan asked. \"Look Ryan, I know that you\\'re just saying all this stuff to be nice, but you can stop now,\" Kelsi said. \"Okay,\" said Ryan, shrugging his shoulders and taking a couple of steps forward. \"I\\'ll stop.\" All of a sudden, he took her face in his hands and pressed his lips to hers. Butterflies began to form in Kelsi\\'s stomach as she placed her hands on Ryan\\'s chest, feeling his heart race at what felt like 100 miles per hour. As Ryan pulled away slowly, Kelsi smiled at him. \"I\\'d sing to you all night if you wanted, Kelsi,\" Ryan grinned. \"Funnily enough, I\\'m tempted to take you up on that off–\" Without warning, Ryan pulled Kelsi close, wrapped his arms around her and kissed her again. \"Honestly, you two are taking you\\'re time,\" said a familiar voice, opening the bathroom door. Sharpay stood in the doorway, eyebrows raised as she watched them pull away. \"Oh, for God\\'s sake,\" she sighed, trying to hide a small smile. \"Maybe I shouldn\\'t have texted you, Ryan.\" She closed the door behind her and settled with the Wildcats. \"Are they finally together?\" asked Taylor hopefully. \"Yeah,\" said Sharpay, nodding. \"You can say that again!\"']","Summary":" ['I DON\\'T OWN HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL OR ANYTHING RELATED.

She visited the beach on every birthday with her brother and mother. She went on long walks on the boardwalk with her friends. She had been there from her birth. She had been there with ever spill and every time her mom went on longer trip, she had been there in California waiting for her. She felt like she was abandoning her old life in favor of one that she\\'d didn\\'t even truly want in the first place. How could she? Her entire life is in California. No, she thought. Her entire life was in California. Her brother had long since left California and her mother had gone with him. For the past few months, it\\'s been her and her father and her friends. For the past few weeks, just her and her father. \"Hey,\" her father spoke. Lucille glanced stole a glance towards her father, who walked into the living room with a cup of coffee in his hand. Her father stood in the doorway to the living room, dressed for the first day of school like she is. His brown hair was styled to spike in the front and his blue eyes were as bright as they were in California. He had dressed in a red button up with a pair of jeans. But, despite that, he seemed more nervous than she felt. She sat in her grandfather\\'s living room, feet propped up on the coffee table, and ready for the first day of the school semester. Since their arrival the night before, he was dancing around the topic, trying to tell her sorry for dragging her halfway across the country and into a new place that she didn\\'t know. \"It\\'s okay, Dad,\" she spoke. \"I understand.\" Her father dropped his head and ran his free hand through his brown hair. Then, he stepped closer, stepping around the couch and dropping beside her. She reached out to take the cup of coffee and gingerly took a sip of it. She glanced over at him and looked at the nervousness on his face. \"I know you understand,\" Troy Bolton spoke. The son of a basketball player and a typical supportive mom, he spent his five college years bouncing between the basketball court and the theater. In his third year, he decided to major in social studies education to follow in his father\\'s footsteps. And now, nearly fifteen years later, he was moving back to his hometown, to teach at his old school, in his father\\'s place after his accident to be around the school where everything changed and he always seemed to be trying to get back to. Even though he was here, he seemed uneasy. \"But, that doesn\\'t make it any harder for you,\" he continued, straightening up in his seat. He seemed uncomfortable. \"Dad,\" Lucille spoke, sitting up. She felt the need to comfort him despite the desperate need in her gut to go back to something familiar. \"Besides, we are here for Grandpa. He needs someone to help him after his accident. And, the school called you specifically for his replacement after Grandpa asked.\" She reached out to touch his knee. \"Besides, I have no life back in California.\" Troy is quiet. \"Yes, you do,\" he replied. \"You just lost someone. You can always go back after you graduate and build a new life.\" He reached out to push a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I can\\'t think of anyone hurting you like that ever again.\" \"It\\'s going to happen, Dad,\" Lucille reassured. \"It\\'s life.\" \"Life can be brutal,\" he spoke. \"Promise me that you\\'ll tell me if things get that bad ever again. Do you understand me?\" Lucille nodded, avoiding his gaze in shame. \"I won\\'t let anyone hurt me like that ever again.\" Her stomach twisted the weight of her previous lie heavy on her mind. Her stomach twisted in knots as she stared into the coffee. She would never let anyone hurt her like that again. Her father\\'s arm around her shoulder and a gentle kiss against her head startled her, causing her to jump beneath his arm. Her father chuckled for a moment and made a joke about startling her, but his voice just came across as fuzziness in her ears. She nodded her head and faked a smile as she sat up to put the cup of coffee on the table. \"Are you ready to go?\" her father questioned. Lucille turned towards him. \"Are you?\" Her father\\'s lips pursed together as he thought about it. \"As ready as I can be.\" Then he headed into the kitchen once again. Lucille stood up, flattening out her skirt and then her shirt, buying time until her father returned. She bent down and picked up her backpack, checking to make sure the laces of her boots were tied. \"You look beautiful,\" he informed her, wrapping an arm around her and guiding her out the door. \"Thanks Dad.\" … \"There you are,\" Chem teacher, Gabriella Castillo (formerly known as Gabriella Montez) looked up to find her best friend, Sharpay Leverett (formerly Sharpay Evans, Broadway star), in the doorway. The blonde was standing in the doorway, looking over the Chem teacher with an accusing look on her face. She stepped inside, closing the door behind her, before crossing over to sit on one of the black desks. \"I thought we talked about this Gabriella,\" Sharpey teased. \"Why are you here so early?\" \"Phillip had baseball practice and Antonio had band practice,\" Gabriella responded. \"And Raphael has a meeting with Coach Bolton\\'s replacement and his daughter so I ended up needing to take him to school.\" \"And, Luisa?\" Sharpay questioned. \"Your husband has her,\" Gabriella responded with a smirk. Sharpay nodded her head in understanding, looking out the window. \"He\\'s going to take her to the middle school when he takes Tiana. Where have you been?\" Sharpey shrugged her shoulders. \"I had a meeting at the Country Club,\" she responded. When Gabriella gave her a confused look, she continued. \"Mom and Fulton needed my input about something. Ever since Dad died, they\\'ve been incorporating me into the decision making. They\\'re worried about business.\" She\\'s quiet for a minute, turning her gaze to the window. \"Ryan was always better at business decisions than me.\" A pause. \"Any news?\" \"No,\" Sharpay huffed. \"He\\'s still—\" The door to the classroom opened and Sharpay stopped talking to turn towards the person walking in the door. Gabriella followed her gaze to find a short brunette girl with blue-gray eyes as wide as saucers, realizing she interrupted a conversation between the two teachers. She\\'s dressed in a black skirt with white leggings beneath it. She had a white \"Matty Neilson\" shirt and an army green jacket over it. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she spoke, quickly. Gabriella\\'s eyes furrowed in confusion. She seemed almost… familiar. \"Principal Castillo suggested that I should start meeting my teachers before school starts.\" \"It\\'s okay,\" Gabriella spoke, standing up from her seat and walking towards her. \"Do you have Chemistry with me?\" She nodded her head. \"Yes,\" she glanced down at the paper in her hand. \"Fourth hour, right before lunch.\" She paused, looking away. \"I think.\" \"That\\'s good, we\\'re not far from the cafeteria so you can get there quickly. I\\'m Mrs. Castillo, the Principal\\'s wife,\" Gabriella responded. Gabriella reached out and shook the girl\\'s hand. It was obvious that she was nervous. \"And this is Mrs. Leverett.\" Sharpay waved from her spot on the desk. \"She\\'s our drama teacher.\" \"Oh,\" the girl spoke, looking down at her schedule again. Then, she looked back towards the blonde. \"I think I have homeroom with you, Mrs. Leverett.\" \"That\\'s great,\" Sharpay spoke, hoping down off the table. \"So, you are the daughter of the basketball coach replacement?\" \"Yes,\" the girl spoke, suddenly looking nervous. \"I am the daughter of Coach Bolton\\'s replacement,\" she echoed, looking at her schedule once again before glancing between the two of them. \"But, I\\'m also the granddaughter of Coach Bolton.\" The blonde beside her is quiet, glancing at Gabriella who is just mystified and confused. \"My father took the position once Principal Castillo called and offered it to him.\" \"You\\'re,\" Gabriella spoke. \"You\\'re Troy\\'s daughter?\" \"Yes,\" the girl spoke. She reached out her hand again. \"I\\'m Lucille Bolton.\" … \"Dad,\" Troy pivoted to see a black-haired boy running up to him. There was sweat on his forehead and a baseball backpack on his shoulder. He was dressed in an army green shirt and a pair of jeans along with a hat that seemed to signify his position on the baseball team. He jogged up to the Principal without much of an additional sweat. \"Evan and I need to work on a project for American History. Is it okay if I go with him after school today? Troy glanced towards the principal, who gave his son a look. \"And where is Daisy going to be?\" The boy turned red, glancing towards Troy as though appalled his dad would even mention his crush in front of a new, foreign teacher. \"Dad!\" \"You spent the majority of the time at Evan\\'s house for the entire break,\" the principal continued with a tone that bordered on teasing. \"Why didn\\'t you and Evan do that project while you were over there?\" The boy shrugged. \"Fine, you can go. Phillip, this is Coach Bolton, the new basketball coach and your new history teacher.\" Phillip briefly paled. \"Oh, any relation to the previous Coach Bolton?\" Troy nodded. \"He\\'s my father. My daughter is around here somewhere but I don\\'t know which way she went. I\\'m not caught up on the curriculum yet,\" he spoke with a nod. \"But I look forward to having my father help me grade your projects.\" Phillip nodded, reaching out his hand. \"I\\'m Phillip Castillo, though my name is probably filed under M section. Technically, it\\'s Phillip Castillo Montez; but, I generally go by Castillo.\" Troy moved to say something because there\\'s something familiar in the way he stands in talks that makes him think maybe . But, there\\'s the sound of heels behind him and Phillip reacts before he can turn around, \"Hey Mom, Dad said I can go to Evan\\'s after school, is that okay?\" \"Yes, that\\'s fine,\" the familiar voice spoke. Troy turned. Sure enough, there she was: Gabriella Montez. It had been nearly twenty years since their breakup in their junior year of college. Troy thought back, briefly, on all the tears spilled in that week long process where they both thought do we really want to do this and ended up with deleted numbers and wishful thoughts. She looked different but felt like the same old Gabriella. She had cut her hair to her shoulders in an angled cut, with the loose curls she always remained replaced with only a slight wave. She wore a floral red top, white denim jeans, and a pair of flats to top it all off. The remains of her high school style still remained. However, she had darker makeup and applied a dark shade of lipstick on her lips. She smiled at Troy before turning her attention to her son. \"Be sure you ask your aunt,\" Gabriella scolded him. On instinct, Phillip responded, \"Aunt Shar, is that okay?\" Aunt Shar? Sure enough, not far behind Gabriella, stood Sharpay. Last time Troy had heard of her, she was a Broadway star, starring in several productions, before retiring and returning home to Albuquerque. But he didn\\'t think the Broadway star would trade in the spotlight for a teacher\\'s salary. But, here she was. He briefly wondered how that story started. The blonde still had her typical curls and dressy but casual style. But, she seemed to have traded hot pink for a more subtle light pink. She was wearing a pair of denim jeans and an accenting light pink top with a gray jacket over it. \"Yes, Phillip,\" Sharpay spoke. \"That\\'s fine.\" Behind Sharpay was Lucille, who simply looked confused. \"Dad, why didn\\'t you tell me your old friends were teachers here?\" Troy shrugged his shoulders. \"I\\'m just as surprised as you.\" He pivoted towards Phillip, who was looking at the group confused. \"Phillip, this is my daughter, Lucille Bolton. Lucky, this is Phillip Castillo Montez, the son of Principal Castillo and Mrs. Castillo.\" The two teenagers shifted through bodies to briefly shake hands with each other. Gabriella spoke up. \"Phillip, Ms. Bolton is in your Chemistry class and your homeroom. Do you mind showing her where her other classes will be?\" \"Of course,\" Phillip spoke, looking at Lucille confused. Lucille seemed to exchange an equally as puzzled look. \"What are your other classes?\" Lucille handed off her schedule. As Phillip looked over the schedule, Lucille glanced towards her father. There\\'s a silent communication tell me later before Phillip spoke up. Then, the two of them left towards the way that Lucille had come. Troy spotted Phillip look behind him as well. But the moment the two teenagers turned the corner, Gabriella turned towards the Principal with a sad look in her eyes. \"Why didn\\'t you tell me, Raphael?\" Troy looked towards Sharpey, who returned the glance. Then, Troy understood. Raphael and Gabriella\\'s relationship was built on open communication, telling each other everything. Troy\\'s appointment wasn\\'t something they seemed to have discussed. \"I don\\'t know,\" Raphael spoke, his voice quiet. \"Troy,\" Sharpay\\'s voice cut through them. She maneuvered around the couple and looped one of her arm\\'s with Troy\\'s. \"You know, there is an excellent bakery right across the street. I\\'ll show you.\" \"I\\'m not—\" Even years later, Sharpay refused to take no for an answer as she dragged Troy towards the front door and then across the street ... Update: I have changed Sharpey\\'s name. Hey guys, I have returned with a new and updated version of the first three chapters. I hope to bring you guys chapter two soon but school has been kicking my butt lately so I hope you guys stay with me on this one. Next chapter: a bakery & lunchtime & Daisy Pickens & a surprise.'][Chapter 2] ['Chapter Two: Reunions … \"Sharpay,\" Troy started. \"No,\" the blonde stated as she dragged the older man across the parking lot, weaving through cars like it was natural. He wondered just how many times she\\'s done this. \"I haven\\'t seen you for over twenty years, Troy Bolton, aside from photos on your dad\\'s desk or stories that he tells. But, we have class in twenty minutes and there is one person that you HAVE to see before class starts. All the teachers go here before school. It\\'s practically a tradition.\" \"Sharpay,\" Troy interrupted. \"I don\\'t even know what the lesson plan is for today.\" He was fairly certain she rolled her eyes. \"And I\\'m sure that you\\'ll be fine for five minutes before going to your classroom and throwing it all away anyways to pick up somewhere fresh or spend the entire hour learning about your students,\" Sharpay responded. \"But, before you are able to do that, you need to see the bakery.\" She nodded ahead of them, causing Troy to look up and see the bakery that was coming into focus. It had dark brown wood and large glass windows that allowed Troy to see inside the shop at the numerous customers that were piling in. Most of them seemed to be high school students, eagerly grabbing for their first taste of food before lunch in several hours. Despite having a woodsy vibe, the sign above the store had a sign with bright blue letters that read— \"Zeke\\'s Treats?\" Troy echoed, looking at the blonde beside him. His voice seemed to betray his emotions, easily allowing the blonde to read them. The last that Troy had heard of Zeke was after his accident, which left him in a state where he was unable to play basketball anymore and had to wear a leg brace for the rest of his life once his leg repaired itself. Troy had been crushed to hear of his old friend\\'s accident and kept up with Jason to hear of his condition. But soon, even Troy lost sight of Zeke\\'s condition, only hearing updates from his father. But, even his father hadn\\'t mentioned that Zeke had opened a bakery. Sharpay gave him a small smile. \"Been open for a couple months now,\" she responded. \"Zeke finally got enough money to open his own shop after working at the country club as a manager. I tried to tell him that I would help him open the shop but he wouldn\\'t take the money.\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"So I\\'ve been slipping a five dollar bill every time I order something into the tip jar. It all goes directly to Shelby\\'s college savings.\" \"Shelby?\" Troy questioned. \"Zeke\\'s daughter,\" Sharpay filled in. \"Sorry, I forget that you aren\\'t connected on any sort of social media.\" She pulled open the door and ushered him inside. Troy cautiously stepped inside the bakery, looking around at the students who weren\\'t paying them any attention. All the students simply ate their pastries and donuts to their heart\\'s content as they talked with their friends or whoever was across from them. Only a few seconds after Sharpay stepped inside did the door swing open once again. \"Dad,\" Lucille greeted, beaming at him. Phillip Castillo filed in beside her, making sure the door didn\\'t slam shut. \"Phillip saw you guys headed this way so he decided to show me the bakery.\" She looked around. \"Is it always this busy before classes?\" Phillip nodded his head. \"Students are given a lot of discounts,\" he responded, looking around as though he was looking for someone. \"I think the owner does it out of the kindness of his heart and all but it brings in a lot of revenue in the early mornings. But it\\'s the best donuts since Krispy Kreme permanently closed down.\" Sharpay moved towards the counter, leaning over the white marble to shout into the kitchen but because of the noise of the students around them, Troy couldn\\'t make out what she was saying. He glanced around at several boys who were eyeing Lucille and found himself subconsciously reaching for her hand. Phillip didn\\'t think anything of the gesture but Lucille looked up at him confused and amused. \"Troy Bolton!\" a large man came around the corner. It was Zeke Baylor, his former teammate, dressed in a pair of jeans and an old Wildcats shirt. Despite the fact it had been over 20 years, he still looked like the same old Zeke, just older and wiser. And the fact he had a giant, knee brace on his right knee. When he walked, he almost dragged it behind him as though it pained him to move it. However, it didn\\'t slow him down. \"Zeke!\" Troy greeted, dropping his daughter\\'s hand to embrace his old friend. It almost felt like it used to be. \"It\\'s so good to see you again.\" \"Yeah,\" Zeke chuckled. \"Things have changed since the last time we\\'ve properly hung out.\" He pointed towards the leg brace before looking around the bakery. \"Yeah,\" Troy trailed off. \"I\\'ve had other priorities the past couple of years,\" he responded, sounding ashamed. And, to an extent, he was. He felt like he didn\\'t know any of his old friends. But Lucille, his son, and his wife had been encompassing his entire life for around 20 years now. He glanced towards Lucille, who gave him a smile that said \"I understand what you meant\" because of course she did. Zeke didn\\'t miss the look. \"Who\\'s this?\" he asked, curious. \"This is my daughter,\" Troy spoke, reaching out to bring her closer. Lucille stepped closer to him, clinging to his side. \"Zeke, this is Lucille. Lucky, this is Zeke Baylor, the best chef in East High history.\" Lucille beamed, holding out her hand. \"Hello,\" she spoke. \"Hey!\" Zeke beamed. He stepped closer to give her a hug, which Lucille awkwardly tried to return to the best of her abilities. \"You need to get back to school soon. If you meet my daughter, tell her hello. She\\'s dating Daniel, Chad\\'s kid,\" he added. Lucille nodded her head before turning towards her father. Once she wasn\\'t facing Zeke, she allowed her face to portray the confusion that Troy temporarily felt. Both of them knew what happened between Daniel and … \"Mr. Baylor,\" Phillip spoke up. \"Is there a way I can get half a dozen donuts for the road?\" \"Of course!\" Zeke spoke, moving around the corner. \"Troy, do you want one too?\" The brunette nodded his head towards Zeke before turning towards Lucille, who stepped towards the counter with Phillip as well. Troy made a mental note to talk to Daniel later, but right now, he needed to focus on his daughter and the upcoming lesson plan for the day. … The music room on East High\\'s third floor was vast and huge, reserved for the band to practice their different examinations or (in the fall) marching music. The large room was filled with all types of instruments from drums to guitars to flutes and trumpets and tubas. In the furthest corner was a working piano, which Evan Leverett had long since dubbed his \"morning relaxation\". He had been coming to the music room every morning since he started at East High and that hasn\\'t stopped in the past three years…though he does have company now. \"Where\\'s he?\" Daisy spoke, for the third time in the past fifteen minutes. Evan Leverett glanced up from his composition to his cousin. The product of a behind-the-scenes photographer and a former Broadway star, Evan leaned towards being more like his father than he did his mother. His blonde hair fell naturally into curls that poked out from his gray beanie. From a young age, he always knew that he was different—add the fact that he liked to kiss boys instead of girls, he always found himself hiding in the shadows even if he had a knack for singing on a stage and dancing. His cousin stood on the other side of the room by the guitar and symbols. She was a tall brunette with long curls. Today, she had opted to wear a pair of jeans and a simple blue tank top that flowed around her body. It had only been six months that the two cousins knew of each other after his Uncle Ryan distanced himself from his family because… well, it was hard to explain. Now, Daisy Evans-Pierce was living in the Leverett household while Evan\\'s Uncle Ryan… recovered. In the past six months, she had practically become queen of the drama club and manage to form feelings for Evan\\'s best friend. Not that Phillip Castillo didn\\'t return the feelings and was too awkward to simply come out and say his true feelings. Evan always found that kissing the target of his affections tended to work in his favor. \"I\\'m sure he got caught up with something,\" Evan responded, attempting to figure out what came next in the composition. There was a repetition of the chorus, the change of voices, and then he permanently found himself stuck. He needed to have this done three weeks ago but he keeps finding himself stuck. It\\'s wrong. \"I mean, he is the co-captain of the baseball team, on the scholastic decathlon, president of the Chem Club, and apparently being nominated at the president of the Student Council…\" He paused, looking at the composition and found himself momentarily side-tracked though his companion didn\\'t seem to notice. \"Having a name might help…\" he spoke to himself. But what would he name it? \"Who\\'s she?\" Daisy\\'s voice is quiet and soft, so soft that he barely managed to hear it. Evan\\'s eyes flew up concerned, only to find her simply looking out the window. There was a look of pain on her face that caused Evan to instinctively fly off the seat behind the piano, moving to her side to see what she was looking at, before he had even thought about doing it. Once he was by her side and saw what she saw, he found Phillip Castillo, marching through cars with a half a dozen box of donuts under one arm, and a girl to his left. Evan didn\\'t know the girl (he would find out in homeroom that her name is Lucille Bolton, the granddaughter of Jack Bolton and the daughter of the new teacher) and she didn\\'t look familiar to him. The only thing that he knew was that he didn\\'t know her. \"I don\\'t know,\" Evan spoke. He tried to put logic to it, to make Daisy feel better. \"He\\'s the principal\\'s kid. The new teacher and his daughter was supposed to start today. Maybe Raphael asked Phillip to show her around. He does know the school like the back of his hand.\" He reached out to touch Daisy\\'s shoulder and saw her barley flinch when he did. \"I\\'m sorry.\" \"It\\'s okay,\" Daisy spoke, as though she tried to apologize for flinching. It was a reflex that she had simply learned. \"You\\'re right, she\\'s probably just new.\" \"Yeah,\" Evan spoke, looking at her features. \"Phillip\\'s just nice like that.\" Daisy looked at her shoes. \"Do you really think so?\" \"Yes,\" Evan replied, moving towards his things. He placed his composition in his folder before neatly placing it in his backpack. He turned towards her to see that she was still standing by the window. \"Plus, I don\\'t think those donuts are for me even if he tries to spin it that way.\" He glanced over to see her smiling at his comment but didn\\'t comment on the ghosts in her eyes because he knew she didn\\'t like him noticing. ... After Chemistry class, Lucille followed the swarm of people to the cafeteria, looking around hopelessly at the three-leveled cafeteria that was filled to the brim with tables and students. There were different cliques, each encompassing their own table or in some cases, tables. As Lucille looked around, she spotted Phillip standing in line with a blonde boy who is taller than him. He turned around, spotting her confused and waved at her. Then, his eyebrows furrowed and he pointed behind her. Then, \"BOLTON!\" Two arms encompassed her waist, pulling her off her feet, causing her to squeal as her feet frantically moved to find some sort of solid ground to stand on. She clung on the arms that were holding her as though he would drop her. \"Danforth!\" she cried, \"Put me down.\" Daniel Danforth, the only person it could possibly be, chuckled in her ear as he dropped her down on her feet. But, he quickly pulled her into a hug before she could even look at him. \"You should\\'ve seen me tackle your dad,\" Daniel chuckled in her ear. \"Why didn\\'t any of you tell me that you were coming?\" Lucille chuckled. \"It\\'s just me and Dad.\" \"I know,\" Daniel spoke, pulling backwards. Lucille beamed up at him. It had been a year since the Danforth family had visited the whole gang of Boltons in California for Christmas. Even her Papa Jack and Nana Alyson were there. Lucille and her brother were the same age as Daniel so as a result, they were all close, practically siblings. It had been the last time they had all been together, walking along the beach, talking about life without feeling the need to look over their shoulder. \"Where is your mom and—?\" \"London, I think,\" Lucille interrupted, being aware of the numerous people watching them. Daniel nodded, he understood. There\\'s a shameful look as though he forgot. \"Have you gotten taller?\" He had. Last year, they had been the same height when Lucille wore boots. Now, he was over a head taller and he was just wearing simple running shoes. His black hair was still as straight as his mother\\'s (his brother had been the one to inherit their father\\'s hair). He wore a pair of jeans and an East High t-shirt. \"Let\\'s get food,\" Daniel answered, instead. He grabbed her hand and pulled her towards the line, specifically towards a girl, who was giving her a glare. The woman had dark, almost black hair that curled to her shoulder. She was dressed in a nice shirt and a pair of jeans that curved to her figure along with a cardigan over her shoulders. Daniel didn\\'t seem to notice the glare as he introduced Lucille to Shelby Baylor. \"She\\'s practically my little sister,\" Daniel spoke, beaming at her. This comment did little to lessen the glare. The girl didn\\'t stay around for very long because a girl at a table filled with cheerleaders called her over and she kissed Daniel on the lips before moving away. Lucille looked at Daniel, raising an eyebrow in his direction. \"Sorry about her,\" Daniel spoke, turning towards Lucille. \"She\\'s got a jealous streak a mile long.\" \"Is that Shelby Baylor?\" she questioned. Daniel gave her a look of confusion and a teasing smile formed on his face. She spoke before he could get the joke out, \"I met her dad earlier. He mentioned that his daughter, Shelby, was dating you.\" She raised an eyebrow. \"Did you want to talk about that? Because I have some questions.\" Daniel rolled his eyes, knowing exactly what she was talking about. \"That was a long time ago..\" Lucille gave him a look. \"Was it though?\" \"Lucille,\" Daniel pleaded, his voice low in a whisper as though he didn\\'t want to be overheard talking about it. \"I don\\'t want to talk about it. It\\'s a complicated situation.\" Lucille looked at him. \"Is it complicated?\" Daniel threw his head backwards. Lucille reached out to touch his arm. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she whispered. \"I know you don\\'t want to talk about it. I won\\'t talk about it anymore.\" She added, \"Here.\" Daniel gave her a thankful glance and then promptly started beaming. \"I\\'m going to go appease my girlfriend,\" he spoke. \"Be right back.\" Then, he darted off over to the table of cheerleaders to wrap his arms around Shelby\\'s waist and kiss her cheek. Lucille watched them, noticing how Shelby beamed at the sudden flare of affection. Lucille turned back in line, realizing she might have just cut in line by fulfilling Daniel\\'s spot. \"So, you\\'re Daniel\\'s friend?\" a voice behind her spoke. Lucille whirled around to find a girl standing behind her. The girl had long deep blue hair pulled up in a ponytail on the top of her head, but Lucille could still see the black roots. Her hair had a slight curl to it, but black wisps of hair framed the side of her face. She wore a black dress with a gray and black striped cardigan over it. She wore a pair of gray leggings with black skulls on it and a pair of black boots. She stood out amongst the color of the groups around them. \"Yes,\" Lucille spoke. \"I\\'m Lucille Bolton.\" \"Evelyn Lawrence,\" she introduced. \"I\\'m Daniel\\'s lab partner.\" She pointed in the direction of Daniel and Shelby, the taller of the two was talking to the cheerleaders friends behind her. The girls giggled. \"He\\'s a real ladies man,\" she joked, rolling her eyes. Lucille shrugged her shoulders, briefly adjusting her bookbag. \"Yeah, I guess,\" she responded, noting the sarcasm in her companion\\'s voice. \"The school is so much to get used to,\" she spoke, trying to start a conversation with the girl. \"So many things going on.\" \"Yeah,\" Evelyn spoke. The line inched forward and the two girls went with it. \"This school is every stereotypical clique rolled into one,\" she spoke. \"It\\'s only a matter of time before you try to get shoved into one of them, she warned.\" Lucille blinked, looking at her. \"What do you mean?\" Evelyn pointed towards Daniel and Shelby. \"They are the typical \\'power couple\\'. The captain of the basketball team and the captain of the cheerleading team. They form together to be the jocks.\" She moved her finger towards Phillip, who walked out of the lunch with the blonde boy she spotted earlier. \"Phillip Castillo encompasses the perfect straight A student cliché with numerous activities being baseball, scholastic decathlon, etc., and not a lot of time to do them all. His best friend, Evan Leverett, is the same but from the musical side of things. Evan has a perfect social life and still manages the time to write the musical, numerous compositions, along with Write Club and Film Club.\" \"Wow,\" Lucille mumbled, feeling overwhelmed just thinking about everything Evan was in. \"That\\'s a lot.\" Evelyn nodded her head. \"Everyone has their own clique to stay. If you don\\'t belong, you are alone.\" She looked around. \"Both Evan and Phillip do a lot, but their interests tend to overlap to the same thing. Nothing too drastic. Now, me, I\\'m into pretty much everything. But, I don\\'t fit in one place so I just wander from group to group. Daniel finds me amusing in Chemistry but once we leave the classroom, he\\'s back into his clique and I\\'m back in my lonely bubble.\" \"Sounds lonely,\" Lucille spoke. \"Well, you got a friend in me, Evelyn.\" \"Evie,\" she spoke, grinning. \"My friends call me Evie.\" … Jack Bolton hated hospitals. He hated them when his son was born. He hated them when his wife got sick. He hated them even more when she passed away. He continued to hate them when his daughter-in-law was hospitalized and put on permanent bedrest while pregnant with his grandchildren. He hated them more when his grandson was briefly in the ICU. And, he especially hated them after his car accident that was caused by his heart attack. In fact, he hated them even more. Having to ask for help was something that Jack Bolton never liked doing. But, something he learned that he had to do with a broken leg. In fact, he had a nurse coming in every hour (sometimes sooner) to check and make sure that he wasn\\'t having any symptoms of another heart attack. It was daunting because he felt like he couldn\\'t do anything without having a nurse come care for him. He let out a heavy sigh, watching the third NCIS rerun he had seen today. He didn\\'t know how in the world he could take another week of the same thing before they even thought about discharging them back into his own house. \"Bolton,\" Alyson Darbus sat in the corner of the room, knitting something with red yarn. His companion had been his coworker at East High before she moved up into the Department of Education to advocate for more funding for the arts. Her former student, Sharpay, had since taken over her position at East High. Despite the years, her style had not changed, though her hair (like Jack\\'s) had more gray than it used to. \"You getting frustrated about being in a hospital will not make that time go faster.\" \"I can try, Darbus,\" he rebuffed. In contrast, Jack Bolton was dressed in nothing but a hospital gown. His right leg was propped up on a stack of pillows while the entire left side of his body was stiffer than it had ever been. What he wouldn\\'t give to get up and move around on both feet. He kept his hair short in recent years because of the amount of gray in it. He had cuts on his face from the glass and his left arm was in a sling. The two of them had once been enemies. Jack\\'s program gained more money than the drama program as a whole and the former hadn\\'t taken too kindly to Ms. Darbus constantly putting his players in detention for practice. While both long since admitted they were wrong, they still had numerous fights over the matter. They were close, but sharing two grandchildren and being bound by their children\\'s marriage made them even closer. It was a twist of irony: Jack Bolton\\'s son and Alyson Darbus\\'s adopted daughter. \"Have you heard from Troy?\" Jack questioned. Alyson shook her head. \"Not since lunch,\" she spoke. It was already almost 7. Troy and Lucille were supposed to stop by the hospital after dinner. If practice ran late, it made sense. \"But, he took over not only your teaching position but also your coaching position,\" she spoke. \"And there is going to be a championship game in three weeks\\' time.\" Jack groaned. \"Don\\'t remind me. Of all the times to have a car accident, it had to be three weeks before the biggest game of the year.\" Alyson looked up from her knitting to give him a light glare. \"Don\\'t start with that, Jack,\" she spoke quietly. \"It isn\\'t your fault. There\\'s no way that you could\\'ve stopped it from happening no matter how hard that you tried. Lucille wouldn\\'t want you beating yourself up like this.\" \"I know,\" he spoke. For a minute, they\\'re quiet. Alyson returned to her knitting while Jack continued on watching the reruns of NCIS. And, for a minute, that\\'s all they are. Then, the door swung open. Jack turned, expecting to find another nurse, only to find his granddaughter walking in with a bag of food from Olive Garden in her hand. \"Papa!\" she cried, running towards him. She placed the food on his tray and leaned down to kiss his cheek, careful with his arm. Jack beamed at the sight of his granddaughter. \"Hi, Lucky. Did you get taller?\" His granddaughter grinned before walking around the hospital bed to embrace her grandmother, who stood up to meet her. \"Hi, Nana,\" Lucille spoke, gripping her grandmother tightly. Alyson grinned as she pulled back from her, playing with Lucille\\'s brown hair. \"How was your first day at East High?\" Jack questioned. Lucille beamed at her grandfather. \"Good! I met a couple people and Phillip Castillo showed me around. But, I met Daniel\\'s lab partner at lunch and we exchanged numbers. Her name is Evelyn Lawrence.\" \"Oh, Evelyn,\" Jack beamed. \"She\\'s real sweet. Pretty much is into everything. If you want to know if a club is good, ask her. She knows.\" He looked around as Lucille pulled out a meal, handing it to Alyson and then another, placing it on the table in front of them. \"You got us food?\" \"Of course,\" Lucille spoke, looking at them in disbelief. \"Dad called the nurse\\'s station and asked if you guys had eaten. And, we already got your meal approved, Papa. When they said you hadn\\'t, we went ahead and got food. When we were headed inside, he got a phone call from Mom so he told me to head inside so I could get the food to you before the nurse spoiled the surprise.\" Jack laughed, \"Well, thank you, Lucky. That means a lot.\" \"Evening,\" Troy called, walking into the hospital room. He closed the door behind him before moving over to the food. Jack noticed that he had obviously been sweating even before he shook his dad\\'s hand. \"Hi, Dad, how are you doing?\" Jack held his son\\'s hand for a little longer before letting him go. Troy walked around to hug Alyson, affectionately calling her mom. \"I\\'d be better if I was out of this hospital bed,\" Jack spoke. Lucille opened up a container and began cutting up the entrée inside. Jack looked and realized that it must\\'ve been his from the way she was cutting it. \"How was practice?\" \"It was good,\" Troy started. \"We were supposed to be out of there at 6,\" Lucille interrupted. \"He told me to meet him outside of his classroom at 6 then we would leave. But, by 6:30, he wasn\\'t there. So, I went down to try and find him and where do I find him? In the gym, playing basketball with the members of the team, directing them around.\" She looked towards her grandmother, using the knife to point towards her father. \"I was starving.\" Jack laughed. \"Lucille, you know they have a championship game in three weeks.\" \"I know,\" Lucille responded, pouting. \"But I was starving and he said 6.\" \"Lucille,\" Troy responded. \"I promise that I didn\\'t mean to go over on time. I promise that tomorrow I will be there at 6.\" Lucille stuck out her tongue in response. \"I\\'m not holding you to it.\" Jack laughed. Lucille handed her father his food from the bag, no longer holding it hostage. Once his food was all cut up, Lucille placed it on Jack\\'s tray and cautiously rolled the tray to him so it wouldn\\'t tip over. Jack thanked his granddaughter who moved to grab her own food. Jack talked with Troy about the team while Alyson asked Lucille more about the day. For the first time in a year, the family was back together. Even if they were missing two people.

But, for now, we\\'re getting into the motions of the story. I hope you guys enjoy this chapter! I do not own any recognizable characters from the High School Musical franchise. All rights go to Disney and their respective corporations/those who have the rights. Chapter Three: A Familiar Tune \"Duck!\" Lucille glanced up and on instinct, her hands flew up, dropping her binder to catch the basketball in her hands. It stopped, but if it had kept going, it would\\'ve hit her and most definitely given her a bruise. She heard the binder hit the wooden floor and breathed in relief when she didn\\'t hear the papers scatter on the floor. She dropped her hands to look at the boys with white and red uniforms and the handful with blue and yellow uniforms. She blinked. \"I didn\\'t just walk into a game, did I?\" Daniel laughed, pushing himself through the crowd to walk towards her. \"Scrimmage,\" he spoke, off-handedly. \"Championship game is in a couple weeks, you know?\" She passed him the ball, smiling at the fact that he faltered in his step. \"Yes, I remember but I didn\\'t know that you had a scrimmage today.\" She bent down to pick up her binder from the floor, looking over it. She breathed in relief to the fact that there wasn\\'t a tear down the spine. \"Besides I needed to speak to my dad.\" Daniel nodded his head, shouting over his shoulder. \"Coach!\" As Lucille heard her father run over, Daniel tossed the basketball over his shoulder and patted a tall boy with a blue uniform on the shoulder. Daniel shouted towards the rest of the players and they all ran from the scene. Except for the boy, who moved towards her. The boy was taller than Lucille by a full foot. His brown hair was long, pressing against his forehead by a large amount of sweat. He had brown eyes that were dark and full of worry or concern. She couldn\\'t really tell. He was handsome, Lucille noted, with a defined jawline and tanned skin. Like almost all of the basketball players, his muscles were defined and obvious in the uniform he wore. He looked older than Daniel. He might\\'ve even been a senior at West High. \"I\\'m sorry,\" the boy apologized, quickly seeing her confusion. \"I\\'m the one who hit the ball towards you.\" She shook her head at him. \"You don\\'t have to apologize. You had no idea I was going to come through that door. Besides, you were just trying to keep it out of the opposing team\\'s hands. I can\\'t fault you for it.\" He opened his mouth to refute, but she cut him off. \"Besides, I have good reflexes and my binder is fine. So, you don\\'t have to apologize.\" He blinked down at her, an amused grin ghosting over his features. \"You\\'re not going to accept my apology, are you?\" \"Nothing to apologize for,\" she responded. \"Or I would.\" \"I\\'m still going to apologize.\" \"Well, I\\'m not going to accept it,\" Lucille spoke. The boy opened his mouth to respond with what she assumed would\\'ve been a snarky comment when her father stopped him before he could. \"Fulton,\" her father spoke, looking between the two of them. \"Is everything okay?\" \"Everything\\'s good, Coach,\" \\'Fulton\\' spoke, quickly. \"I was just apologizing for hitting the basketball towards her when she walked in. She\\'s not accepting my apology though.\" Her father looked towards her. Lucille shook her head in response. \"Yeah,\" her father spoke. \"She tends to do that from time to time. Now, go on, Fulton, I think your coach is wanting to call a meeting.\" Fulton nodded his head, running off in the direction of the other basketball players with blue and yellow outfits. Her father turned towards her and she glanced up at him. \"Good thing I decided to teach you basketball as well. Your mother would\\'ve gotten hit in the face.\" Lucille laughed. \"I have good reflexes.\" \"Yeah,\" Troy spoke. \"Well, your mother tripped over a…\" \"Dad,\" she cut him off. \"I know.\" He shook his head. \"Right, what\\'s up, Luck? You know that I\\'m going to have practice pretty much every day until the championship game in a few weeks.\" \"Yeah,\" Lucille spoke, looking towards the basketball players, who were huddled together talking until the coach came back. \"Well, Evelyn offered to take me home after Write Club and I just wanted to let you know.\" Her father raised an eyebrow at her. \"I know you leave your phone in the office while practice is going. I wanted to make sure before you went searching for me throughout the school without checking your phone.\" He laughed. \"You know me too well, Luck.\" He leaned down to press a kiss against her cheek. \"I\\'ll see you at home. Do you want Olive Garden for dinner?\" \"Sure! My usual!\" \"Okay, I\\'ll pick it up after practice is over.\" And with that, she left. … \"Matty! Matty! Matty!\" The crowd chanted his name as he waved, beaming from ear-to-ear. As the lights dimmed down and let him regain the majority of his vision, he moved offstage, turning the microphone in his hand off. He beamed brightly until he was backstage, high fiving the members of the band for another successful show, grinning through the photos for the VIP members and actively talking to each and every one of them. He cared about them, each and every one of them, but that didn\\'t stop the grin from falling the moment the door of his dressing room slammed shut behind him or him flopping on the couch with a heavy groan escaping his lips. It was late. He was exhausted. But, still, he grabbed his phone from the spot on the table and opened up the messages. He had a few from his friends from the fine arts academy he went to through his high school years. He had another from a model who wanted to date him (but he didn\\'t really want to date him) and another from an actress with the same intentions (but, he didn\\'t really want to date her either). And, he scrolled through them all until he found the one that had clovers for the name. He smiled at his own inside joke and typed out the message. How\\'s school treating you , he typed out. He sent the message without batting an eye and leaned his head back, propping his feet up on armrest. Matty Nielsen was in the lap of luxury, but he couldn\\'t help feeling like he didn\\'t belong here. An international pop star, adored by millions (maybe even billions) of fans, thrust into the limelight because of a YouTube video of covers that turned into records. Plus, being the son of a world-famous director and composer helped. The designer jeans on his legs were soft but heavy and way too expensive for his tastes. He only wore a white t-shirt under a blazer and only wore the blazer because of the chill in the air. With a grunt, Matty stood up and moved towards the vanity on the other end of the dressing room, grabbing a makeup wipe to wipe off the makeup he needed to have so the crowd didn\\'t see the bags under his eyes. With every forceful swipe, more makeup scraped off. Then he grabbed another wipe, then another, until all the makeup was gone. He deposited the wipes into the garbage bin, running his hands through his hair and messing up the hard work that the hairstylist had done before the show had even started. With a sigh, Matty leaned back in the chair, looking at his reflection. There, now he looked like him. On the other side of the mirror, there was a boy with dark brown hair and blue eyes. There were obvious bags under his eyes that came with sleeping on a plane the night before. He looked tired and exhausted and like he didn\\'t really want to be there. He shrugged off the blazer and whatever he had that was giving him the illusion of looking older was stripped away. Now, without the blazer, he looked like a seventeen-year-old boy, who desperately missed the other half of his family. The door opened. In the mirror, Matty spotted his mother walking through the door. She spotted him on the seat and gave him a sympathetic glance. The door closed behind her and she quickly walked over, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and planting a kiss against his cheek. Of the two of them, Matty suspected that she wanted to be home the most. And, she could\\'ve been. She had turned down offers for several months. She could be home right now with her husband and her daughter, but she was out here on the road with him simply because she didn\\'t want him to be alone. \"You had a wonderful show tonight,\" she told him. \"Thanks, Mom,\" he responded. His mother didn\\'t look like she had bags in her eyes. Hell, she didn\\'t even look tired . Her long brown hair fell down her face in her natural curls and bright blue eyes that were obscured by the brown-framed glasses she always wore. Tonight, she wore a long sleeve jacket with a \\'Matty Nielsen\\' t-shirt beneath and a pair of denim jeans. She beamed at him, the kind of smile that reached her entire face and made it glow. \"You remind me so much of your father,\" she told him, reaching up to play with the strands of her dark hair. She grinned at him. \"I especially see it when you perform. I watch you and I\\'m just like there\\'s-\" She\\'s cut off by the ascension of notes from his phone. He got a text message. His mother walked over to the phone and picked it up. She smiled as she peered down at it, shrugging off her black jacket and depositing it on the couch. Matty saw the curled letters of her tattoo on her left arm as she bent down to pick up the phone. Playmaker , it read. \"Your sister says she\\'s having a good time,\" her mother spoke, her fingers reaching up to touch the tattoo lovingly. Matty smiled, though it was mostly forced. He wished he was with her. \"That\\'s good.\" He put his face in his hands and his mother moved to embrace him once again, pressing a kiss against his forehead. Matty spotted the tattoo through his fingers and reached down to touch the black ink on her skin. … Lucille felt tired as she moved through the empty halls of East High. It would be another hour before Evelyn was out of writing club and she\\'d be able to go home. She felt like walking home, walking always helped her clear her mind, but she hadn\\'t quite memorized the route home yet. And, even if she got lost, she wasn\\'t certain that she\\'d be able to describe enough of the scenery around her well enough for Evelyn to be able to find her. Well, she could probably find her way home through sheer determination, but she decided not to chance it today. So, instead, she decided to learn the school a bit more. Every time she came to a room she didn\\'t know, she tried to open the door and, if that didn\\'t work, she peered in the window that was in each of the doors. She found a couple of science classrooms and an English classroom that looked like the teacher was also an art teacher from the way it was decorated like Platform 9 ¾. But, it wasn\\'t until she got to the third floor that she found something that made her eyes widen and grin. The door opened for her and she stepped inside. The music room. The gigantic piano in the middle of the room was untouched. With a grin on her face, she moved over to the piano, not bothering to look at any of the other instruments. She dropped her bag by the stool and slid on it carefully. She pushed up the cover of the keys, making sure it was secure before she placed her fingers against the keys. The melody rang out in the music room, bouncing off the walls until it returned to her. She grinned, sadly. Playing the piano always reminded her of her mother, who was so far away now. In fact…, she thought. Was this the same piano? Her fingers touched the keys, finding the melody that she hadn\\'t forgotten. It was a song that her parents used to sing in the quiet moments, that her father sung to her when she was learning how to waltz, and a song that she used to sing to herself before everything else had happened. It wasn\\'t hard for her to remember the melody and it wasn\\'t difficult for her to replicate the melody on the keys in front of her. Her fingers danced across the piano keys, in time and keeping up with the beat. Her head rocked the beat, her shoulders moved up and down as her fingers flew across the keys. She imagined the lyrics in her head, her feet pressing against the pedals to tune the piano as she went through. She grinned, imagining her father singing the lyrics and trying to coax her exhausted mother into singing with her and imaging when she finally gave in, singing until her father yanked her off the couch to dance to which she would shriek and… She yearned to have her family whole again. \"How do you know that song?\" Lucille jumped when her newfound companion spoke, slamming her knee against the underside of the piano. She pivoted to find Phillip stepping into the music room, the chemistry textbook in one arm and his backpack on one shoulder. He looked like he had just gotten done with baseball practice from the sweat that was against his forehead. He looked apologetic as he closed the door behind him, depositing the book and his bag by the drum set. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he spoke, stepping closer. \"I just…\" he trailed off, slipping into the seat beside her. \"I was at my locker and I heard the melody and my mother used to sing it to me…\" Lucille blinked. \"Really?\" He nodded his head and avoided her gaze. \"Yeah, back when I was young,\" he informed her, an embarrassed red tinge forming on his cheeks. \"She used to stand me on her toes and waltz me around the living room. She did it with me, with my brother, and even with my sister.\" He looked at her. \"She never told me how she knew the song though.\" \"I\\'m pretty sure our parents performed it together,\" Lucille responded, looking at her legs and rubbing her sweaty palms against them. \"Back in high school.\" He nodded his head as though he understood what she meant. \"It\\'s called \\'Can I Have This Dance?\\' which is probably pretty obvious by the lyrics of the chorus,\" she responded, chuckling. \"It was written by, uh, Kelsi Nielsen.\" Phillip\\'s eyes widened. \"That song was written by Kelsi Nielsen?\" Lucille nodded her head, looking at him with an amused expression. \"Yeah, our parents went to high school with her. Didn\\'t you know that?\" \"Yeah,\" he spoke, running a hand through his black hair. \"I just didn\\'t realize the song was written by her is all.\" He chuckled to himself. \"Evan idolizes her, you know. He\\'s always been good at music and he wanted to become a composer. He studies her like a lot . But, I think directing has always been his calling. He nearly fainted when he found out that she was a director as well.\" She figured those comments were to him as well and didn\\'t move to respond back to him. \"I\\'m sorry to have interrupted you,\" Phillip spoke, breaking the silence. \"You can go back to playing now if you want to. You\\'re really good at playing the piano.\" She let out a laugh. \"Thank you,\" she spoke. \"How\\'d you learn?\" \"My mom taught me,\" she responded, quickly as she turned back to the keys. \"I\\'ve known for so long that it\\'s second nature, almost like basketball. Even if I wanted to, I can\\'t forget it.\" And, just like that, she was back to playing the melody. Phillip fell into a state beside her where he simply listened to the soft piano playing, watching her fingers dance across the keys for a bit before he stared at the other end of the wall. Then, he started singing. … \"Troy?\" The two basketball teams were taking a break, a mini \\'half-time\\' if you will, and Troy decided that he would duck into his office to see if he got any calls or texts from his wife or son. He didn\\'t, but he messaged them a goodnight text quickly before he needed to get back on the court. As he was about to send the message off to his wife, there was a gentle knock on the door to his office and he looked up to see a brown-haired woman step inside. For a moment, he blinked, unsure of who it was. \"Jocelyn, is that you?\" She beamed and he jumped up, running forward to wrap his arms around the woman in question, who wrapped her arms around him. \"I haven\\'t seen you in so long. How\\'s Jason?\" Jocelyn was his high school friend\\'s, Jason\\'s, younger sister. She was always on the sideline of the high school games and even came to the Winter Musical to cheer Troy on in his first drama performance. The last that Troy had heard, she was with Zeke Baylor, Jason\\'s best friend. \"He\\'s pretty good,\" Jocelyn spoke, grinning up at him as he pulled out a chair for her. She quickly sat down it while Troy moved around to his side of the desk. \"When Zeke told me that you were Coach Bolton\\'s replacement, I couldn\\'t believe it. Have to admit, I never saw you as a teacher.\" Troy laughed. \"Yeah, I was undecided for a long time. Longer than I should\\'ve been. I came back home for my mom\\'s funeral, you know, and I saw just how many lives my mom affected as a middle school teacher, you know? And, it just kinda hit me there that was what I wanted to be.\" Jocelyn smiled, sadly. \"She was an amazing woman.\" Troy nodded his head, looking at his hands and then over at a picture of his mom, which stood on his desk. She was sick by the time the picture was taken, so sick in fact that he was certain that the picture was taken weeks before she actually passed away. But, she sat on the front porch, beaming up at the photo. \"Well,\" Jocelyn spoke, accidentally cutting him from his daze. She moved to grab something from her purse. \"As much as I would love to spend the next two hours catching each other up on our lives, I\\'ve actually come on a quick personal business.\" \"Oh yeah?\" he questioned. Jocelyn pulled something from her wallet, an envelope, and handed it over to him. \"I know it\\'s pretty much last minute, but,\" He opened the envelope and peered at the card inside. \" You\\'re invited to the wedding of Ezekiel Baker and Jocelyn Cross. February 14th.\" There was an address beneath the scrawl. In France? \"Like, I said, I know it\\'s completely last minute, but it fell on a weekend and I thought that you might be able to swing it since it\\'s after a championship game. I just feel like you should be there, you know?\" She\\'s quiet. \"I mean, if it wasn\\'t for you, I don\\'t think Zeke and I would\\'ve ever gotten together.\" \"I\\'d love to go,\" Troy cut her off before she could go into a nervous stumble. \"However, I would need to talk to it about with Principal Castillo to make sure it wouldn\\'t interfere. It\\'s the week after the Championship game.\" Jocelyn beamed. \"But, I have a question.\" \"Anything.\" \"I don\\'t know if Zeke told you, but my daughter\\'s with me. But, if possible, could I bring my wife and son?\" The words slipped out of his mouth before he could think about it. Before he could backtrack or change his statement, Jocelyn was nodding and speaking a mile a minute, \"Of course, you can bring your wife and son. I can\\'t wait to meet the woman that decided to make you an honest man, Troy Bolton.\" She stood up. \"I won\\'t keep you much longer because I know that you have a scrimmage to get back to. I just wanted to see if you could make it.\" She quickly bent down to give him a hug which he barely managed to return before she was moving out the door. \"I\\'ve got to get back to the store before my future husband realizes that I\\'m gone. I hope we get to see you around more.\" He\\'s alone for several moments before he let out a string of curse words and quickly revised his message to his wife. … Her desk was stacked with papers, from revisions of the musical to more music that Evan wanted to include in the musical or in future musicals along with the quizzes from her drama class. But, all of these needed to wait until tomorrow morning. She needed to go to the hospital and visit Ryan before the visiting hours were over. As she threw her bag over her shoulder and collected the musical notes into her binder, she made a quick run-through of her children\\'s schedule. Evan was in Write Club then he\\'d drive home with Phillip, (while, technically not her child) Daisy had already been picked up by her husband, and Tiana had ballet practice with Luisa until she was picked up by Gabriella. Vincent, her eldest, was at college a few hours away and wouldn\\'t be back home until the weekend. At least, with Vincent or Phillip around, Daisy had enough of a distraction to not want to go to the hospital. Sharpay didn\\'t know how much longer she could handle seeing Daisy watch the unconscious Ryan like that, a tube down his throat and a machine forcing him to stay alive. Something cut through her thoughts as she passed by the music room: a familiar melody with unfamiliar voices. \" It\\'s like catching lightning, the chances of finding someone like you,\" the duo sang, their beautiful harmony seeping under the crack of the door in the music room. Sharpay Leverett remembered the song better than anyone. She had been jealous of it in high school. Kelsi had always written the best music for Troy and Gabriella, and Sharpay had been jealous of Gabriella\\'s relationship with Troy since the day she had transferred to East High. The blonde had tried to manipulate to get the song, but, it had been the one of the first to be cut from the final product because of Sharpay manipulating to get her way. She had loved the song, wished it was sped up a little at the time, but now, she loved it the way it had been written. And, now, the daughter of Troy Bolton and the son of Gabriella Montez sat in the music room, on the piano seat, singing that exact same song. Lucille Bolton was playing the piano, her brown curls falling beneath her beanie in waves. She was rocking out, her entire body moving as she played the melody on the piano and sung the song to her heart\\'s content. Beside her, Phillip sat with her, also singing the song. He only sang when the music was up high so the others couldn\\'t hear him sing or under his breath so no one could hear. It was surprising for her to see him, singing in the music room with a nearly complete stranger to a song she didn\\'t even realize he knew. As she watched them, she furrowed her eyes, gazing at her \"adopted\" nephew as he sat beside the new girl, the song now over, and the two of them chatting about something . He seemed different, she summarized, watching him and trying to figure out what exactly it was that she didn\\'t notice. Then, it hit her like a brick. He was relaxed, not stressed because of some AP final or scholastic decathlon, and he seemed to have been genuinely enjoying himself as he had sung with her. \"You\\'re a good singer,\" Lucille praised him. \"Thanks, you\\'re not so bad yourself.\" \"Thanks, but you don\\'t need to say that.\" As though it made all the sense in the world, without thinking of the possible consequences in both the students\\' lives and her own personal relationship with them, Sharpay knew what she had to do. She put her hand on the door handle, opening the door with finality and peering at the shocked faces of the two students in front of her. \"Aunt Shar?\" he questioned, looking confused. \"Mrs. Leverett?\" she responded, looking positively frightened. She breathed. \"Phillip, Lucille, I want you two to audition for the musical.\" … \"Lucky!\" Troy shouted, walking in the front door with a bag of Olive Garden in one hand. Silence is the only thing that welcomed him home. The alarm was off and Salem\\'s food was filled. So, she had to make it home at some point. He placed the bag of food on the coffee table, petting the black cat who jumped up to meet him. Troy turned, heading up the stairs. He went to her room, the former guest bedroom, and knocked on the door. When there was no sound, he opened it. But, he was only met with half-unpacked boxes and sheets thrown off the bed. Her bag was dumped on the floor along with the clothes she had worn that day. Her keys were on the nightstand. Worried, the next place he went to was the bathroom but it was empty as well. Then, he heard the dribble of a basketball and a swoosh of the net. Confused, Troy headed back downstairs, moving further into the house. Out the windows to the backyard, he spotted his daughter on the basketball court. She was dressed in a pair of denim jeans and a short sleeve shirt. Her brown hair was braided and she was sweating. She must\\'ve been at this a while. Troy moved the food into the kitchen, placing it in the fridge (they could always heat it up later), and headed outside. The sound of the back door opening didn\\'t phase Lucille, who easily tossed the ball through the net like it was nothing. \"Hey Dad,\" she spoke, going to retrieve the basketball. Troy stopped at the edge of the court as she returned to her original spot. \"What\\'s wrong?\" She didn\\'t look at him. \"Nothing\\'s wrong.\" \"Quit lying to me, Lucille,\" he spoke. She tossed the basketball towards the net again, but it hit the rim and ricocheted into the wooden fence behind the house. It bounced onto the court again, but Lucille didn\\'t move to pick it up. She just kept looking at her feet and Troy took the opportunity to step onto the court. She avoided his gaze until the point that Troy was right in front of her. \"You always play basketball when something is wrong,\" he informed her. \"So, what\\'s wrong?\" Lucille let out a sob. The simple sob had effectively sent every single overprotective nerve in Troy\\'s body ablaze. He felt like going to the school and finding out what had happened to make his daughter cry. But, his daughter raised her head to stare at him as she continued to cry. She surged towards him, burying her face into his shirt and wrapping her thin arms around his waist. He quickly wrapped his arms around her, trying to find some way to calm her down at least enough to figure out what was going on, but just settled on returning her hug. \"I don\\'t know what to do, Daddy,\" she cried. Her words were barely manageable through the tears and he spent twice as long deciphering them as he normally did. \"I don\\'t know what to do.\" He didn\\'t know what had caused her to break down, and he figured that he might not know until sometime tomorrow, but he placed a kiss against her head and whispered, \"We\\'ll figure it out, Lucky.\" He hoped it would\\'ve calmed her a bit, but she continued to sob while Troy simply held her against him. Alright, that is another end to a chapter of Another High School Musical! I\\'m still working out how I want the students to be performing their songs because there will be some performances for both of them. So, expect some fiddling around on that when the time comes for that to end up happening. The scenes between Troy and Lucille always seem to come really easily to me. But, I really enjoyed the piece with Kelsi and Matty as well. What did you guys think? Did you like how Phillip and Lucille ended up singing the song that their parents sang? I hope you enjoyed. And, if you did, let me know by submitting a review or sending a private message. I would love to hear from you guys. See you next time around! Next time: Evelyn and Daisy center as they (and those around them) react to the news that Phillip and Lucille are supposedly auditioning for a musical together.'][Chapter 4] ['HEY, another chapter in a couple days time? Well, I\\'m trying to get on a more consistent schedule in terms of uploads. I\\'m trying to do this once a week on Tuesdays, but I start the semester back up next week so we will see how that goes! But, I\\'ve also been in a kick with this story as of late so I think that\\'s why I\\'ve been writing so many chapters lately. We\\'re finally getting into the meat of the story. Let me know what you think! Enjoy! (Also, I\\'ve noticed as chapters have gone on, they keep getting longer and longer). Disclaimer: I do not own anything that is recognizable from the original High School Musical franchise. Another High School Musical Chapter Four: Cracks Evelyn Lawrence had only known Lucille Bolton for two weeks. But, it felt like the two girls had known each other their entire lives. The two quickly fell into a routine that formed on Lucille\\'s second day. Every school day for those two weeks, they had a routine. Lucille would arrive at school with her dad and would wait for the early morning Write Club meeting to be over. She\\'d be sitting outside the library door, most likely reading a book that she was into, whenever Evelyn would walk out. The two would head to the cafeteria, get some breakfast, eat on the stairs against the window (because there were never enough seats), and then head off to their first class of the day. They wouldn\\'t have classes together until History, then Chemistry, and finally homeroom at the end of the day. And, then, Evelyn would take Lucille home while her dad finished up practice. But, today was different. In all honesty, Evelyn wasn\\'t fully aware of how she knew. But, she did. The blue-haired junior was eager to get out of the library, but couldn\\'t because of her position as the vice-president of the club. So, for the hour of the event, as the president (a senior by the name of Natalia) talked about the various activities that they had in store for the upcoming month. They spent a few moments journaling, going around the circle to share their paragraph, before opening up for a free session. In a normal situation, Evelyn was always the first to go. In her eagerness to leave, she declined when she was asked, faking that she didn\\'t have anything to write. Once the president called the meeting, Evelyn was out of her seat, pushing the door open to the library and looking around. Lucille wasn\\'t there. \"Evelyn?\" the blue-haired girl turned to find Natalia, stepping out of the library. The black haired senior looked at her worriedly, trying to figure out what got the normally calm and attentive Evelyn on edge. \"Is everything okay? You seem distracted.\" Evelyn nodded. \"I just feel like something\\'s wrong,\" she admitted. \"I know that we normally talk for a bit about the meeting, but I gotta go find my friend and check on her. Message me anything you want to talk about.\" Natalia nodded her confirmation, which barely registered in Evelyn\\'s mind before she was leaving the library behind her. Evelyn went to the nearest window that looked over the front parking lot and quickly found Mr. Bolton\\'s car in its normal spot not far from the gym. After spotting his car, she glanced at her phone, hoping to find a message from Lucille saying that she was sick or where she was. But, Evelyn only found a private message from a long distance writing friend and a message from Daniel. She filed them both away for later and took off again. Her first stop was the cafeteria. Even from the first floor, she could tell that Lucille wasn\\'t in the cafeteria. She wasn\\'t in any of their normal spots. And, the only person she might\\'ve been with was Daniel Danforth. But even he too was absent. She spotted Shelby Baylor not far away, surrounded by her cheerleaders. The girl spotted her and quickly moved over to Evelyn\\'s position. \"Have you seen Daniel?\" she questioned. \"We were supposed to meet to talk about English.\" Evelyn rose an eyebrow. \"When are you going to admit the truth?\" Evelyn questioned. Shelby blinked at her, surprised at her comment, before crossing her arms over her chest. Evelyn raised an eyebrow at her response which the cheerleader saw and gave her a look that practically screamed be quiet . \"So, have you seen him or not?\" \"No,\" Evelyn answered, honestly. She looked around, trying to figure out where else Lucille might possibly be. \"I\\'m looking for him. Well, technically, I\\'m looking for Lucille and he\\'s known her since they were kids. Let him know that I was looking for him if you happen to see him before I find him, okay?\" The black haired girl nodded her head and moved back towards the cheerleaders who were giggling like mad once she returned. Evelyn suppressed the eye roll and pulled out her phone again. Evelyn saw that she had another message from Daniel and opened it quickly. Maybe he had an idea as to where her friend is. Once she saw the contents of the message, she instantly regretted not opening the message sooner. 7:45 a.m: I found her on the roof. Bring some food. Don\\'t tell Shelby. 7:30 a.m.: Hey, have you seen Lucille? Mr. Bolton says she\\'s here but I haven\\'t found her. Evelyn fired back a quick message, glancing up to find that Shelby was looking over her shoulder at the blue-haired girl. Evelyn turned around, going into the cafeteria. By nothing short of a minor miracle and wasted five minutes, Evelyn managed to convince the breakfast shift to give her three sets of breakfast burritos. The lady running the cashier gave her a curious expression when she checked out but said nothing of it. Once she was free of the lunch line, she began climbing the stairs towards the roof. After two flights of stairs up the cafeteria, her thighs were already screaming at her. She almost felt like taking a break, but something was wrong with Lucille. So, she trudged on, climbing one more flight of stairs and having to use a tremendous amount of force on the door to the roof. The Garden Club always had a field day when it came to this time of the year. They got to retreat their plants into the greenhouses on the roof. But, there were still a handful of plants around the roof in planters. There\\'s at least one planter drilled into the roof that contained a dormant apple tree that would house fruit once it got warmer. But, the roof seemed almost dead in comparison to how it looked in the spring. Leaning against the greenhouse, Lucille sat, looking over the edge of the roof at the suburban part of the city that had surrounded them. Today, she opted to wear a gray beanie on her head, leaving her curls to splay out from beneath the warm fabric. She wore a beige sweater with a pair of gray leggings tucked into a pair of boots. Her hands wrung together, her knuckles white as she clung to the yellow daffodil in her hand with all of her might. She didn\\'t look up once Evelyn arrived on the roof. Daniel, who sat at her feet, looked over once the door opened. Like his companion, he too wore a beanie, but he had on a bright red one and had his basketball number stitched on it. He wore an East High Basketball shirt and a pair of denim jeans with sneakers. His jacket was draped over Lucille\\'s shoulders as she leaned against the greenhouse wall. Upon seeing her, he jumped onto his feet and went to meet her after placing his hand against her knees. \"Hey,\" he spoke, grabbing one of the breakfast burritos from her hand. \"Did you run into Shelby?\" \"Yeah,\" she spoke, crossing her arms over her chest. \"I think she saw me coming up here, but I don\\'t think she thinks that I\\'m going to meet you if that\\'s what you\\'re thinking.\" Daniel nodded his head, glancing towards Lucille. \"What\\'s going on? Am I missing something?\" Daniel\\'s head whipped around, so fast that she feared that he could\\'ve gotten whiplash. \"She didn\\'t tell you?\" \"Would I be asking if I knew?\" she told him, hitting him in the arm. \"I\\'m sorry. I only met Lucille like two weeks ago. It\\'s not like I\\'m in a video game and got enough relationship points to unlock the tragic backstory.\" She glanced towards Lucille. She still wasn\\'t paying attention to the two of them. \"So, are you going to tell me what\\'s going on or not?\" Daniel snuck a concerned glance towards Lucille over his shoulder. \"I don\\'t even know the full details,\" he spoke. \"Her brother, my best friend… he, uh, refused to tell me all the details.\" He ran his palms along the fabric of his jeans. \"But, all I know is that something happened, and I don\\'t know what happened. But, after a certain point, she stopped singing.\" Evelyn blinked, still missing something. \"I\\'m sorry I still don\\'t understand. It\\'s okay for someone to stop singing.\" Daniel shook his head. \"No, not this girl, not her,\" he hurried. Evelyn didn\\'t speak. \"Lucille has been singing for as long as I can remember. She went to the Los Angeles Academy of Dramatic Arts. Some of the best singers in the world come out of there. So, she sang everywhere. She sang with her dad, with her mom, with her brother, with or without music. She had transferred to her father\\'s public school and was doing drama for a bit, but that was her decision. She still sang and she was pretty damn good at it. But, last year, she dropped out of the drama club and didn\\'t sing again.\" Evelyn nodded her head, glancing towards Lucille over his shoulder. She gave him a look and stated the obvious, \"So, what brought it on again?\" \"She got signed up for the musical by Mrs. Leverett,\" he responded. \"I don\\'t know what happened or how it happened. But, I think I have an idea of who to ask and how to get the information.\" She nodded her head. \"Do you mind staying with her? I don\\'t want her to be alone.\" Evelyn nodded her head. \"Please,\" she spoke. \"Be careful.\" Daniel nodded his head, patting her shoulder and moving back towards Lucille. The brunette glanced up at him as he took his jacket back off her knees. He patted her knees and she smiled up at him. His feet sounded loudly against the stairs as he thundered down the stairs. Lucille\\'s eyes returned back to the suburban horizon. Evelyn placed the second of the breakfast burritos on her lap before sitting down on the floor next to her. Lucille didn\\'t smile but placed the daffodil by her feet as she unwrapped her breakfast burrito and took a tentative bite. \"Look,\" Evelyn spoke, reaching out to touch her knee. \"I don\\'t know the full extent of what happened to you. But, whenever you want to talk about it, I\\'m here, okay? I won\\'t judge you. I promise.\" Lucille looked up at her with a watery smile. \"When I\\'m ready to talk about it, I promise I\\'ll tell you.\" Evelyn smiled back at her, a weak smile, and Lucille took another bite before leaning her head back against the greenhouse. … \"What do you think about Lucille Bolton and Phillip Castillo auditioning together?\" one of the stagehands spoke to another. \"I think it\\'ll be fun having new members in the drama department,\" one of the stage directors spoke. Evan turned the page of the script, looking through the notes. He tried to imagine Lucille as the main female character and Phillip as the main male character. He couldn\\'t see it. But, then again, he had never seen Lucille act. Maybe she was good enough to pull it off. \"But, it\\'s all up to Mrs. Leverett I suppose. It is in her favor to introduce more members to the drama department.\" \"How so?\" \"More fees, more people to pitch in with the design,\" the second replied. \"With the budget cuts, it\\'s a miracle that we\\'re having production at all! Plus, maybe if more people get into drama, they can bring in their friends and increase the numbers.\" Evan let out a heavy sigh as he continued flipping through the script, absorbing all of his mother\\'s notes for him to change. All of the things he agreed with. He just needed a fresh set of eyes to help him in the writing department. Evan had been staring at this script since he first finished the rough draft back in summer at Lava Springs. He had been analyzing it and his mother had as well. The two of them needed a fresh set of eyes with a clean script to jot down their ideas on the script itself. Good writing can use a fresh pair of eyes. Evan might\\'ve jumped when he felt someone\\'s breath on his ear, but the all-too-familiar voice of Daniel Danforth drifted into his ear as the boy himself flopped down on the empty table chair beside him. \"Evan,\" he greeted, a playful grin on his face. Evan was alone. People, both within the drama club or the Write club, knew that Evan didn\\'t like to be disturbed whenever he was engrossed in writing, especially when it came for writing from the musical. As a result, his table on the second-floor section of the cafeteria was completely empty aside from him and his bookbag. Even Daisy had taken to sitting on the stairs and looking quizzingly out the window. But, obviously, Daniel Danforth didn\\'t get the memo. \"What do you want, Daniel?\" he questioned. \"There\\'s something I want to talk to you about,\" Daniel spoke. \"Don\\'t worry, it\\'ll be quick.\" \"I\\'m in the middle of something,\" Evan responded, looking back at his notes. \"Okay then,\" Daniel spoke. \"Can I meet you tomorrow morning then?\" Evan glanced up at him in shock, his eyebrows scrunching as he gazed over at the basketball player. \"What?\" the basketball player spoke innocently. \"I really need to talk to you.\" \"About what?\" Evan asked. Daniel gave him a look. There was a playful look in his eyes. The look made his stomach turn but not in the way it was supposed to. \"I just want to know if you know how Lucille got signed up for the musical.\" \"That\\'s it?\" Evan questioned. Daniel shrugged his shoulders and nodded. \"Well, technically, my mother signed her up,\" Evan spoke, turning back to his notes. \"She overheard Phillip and Lucille singing in the music room. She basically told them that they were auditioning for the musical together .\" He gave Daniel a skeptical look as he looked towards the third floor. \"Why? Is something wrong?\" Daniel shook his head and put on a fake smile. \"Nope, everything\\'s good. Just never saw Lucille as a singer, you know? She doesn\\'t really sing.\" The lie was so flawless that Evan was almost impressed. But, he could still tell. Daniel moved to stand up but Evan reached out to place a hand on his knee. The boy halted, falling back down in his seat as he sent a cautioned glance around. But, Evan knew. No one was looking. No one ever looked at Evan. He was the wallflower and always hid in the darkness of someone else\\'s spotlight and it would continue to be this way. Even with the star at his side. \"You know, I can tell you are lying, right?\" Daniel scoffed at him. \"I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, Evan.\" He looked around for a bit and leaned forward. \"Thanks for the information.\" His hand wrapped around Evan\\'s, moving it to Evan\\'s knee and dropping it so his hand hit his thigh. But, as Daniel moved past him, Evan reached out to snag the sleeve of his jacket, pulling him backward. For the star basketball player, he stumbled as Evan pulled him back. The basketball player looked down at Evan with that playful glint shining in his eyes. \"If something is wrong with Lucille, tell me and I\\'ll try to get her out of the audition.\" Daniel nodded, removing Evan\\'s fingers from his coat one-by-one until his hand dropped back on the table. \"Thanks,\" he grinned, saluting him as he made his way back towards the stairs. Even though he couldn\\'t see Daniel anymore, he heard the shouts of his girlfriend as she threw herself at him, most likely pressing kisses against his lips and being overly showy of her affections towards him just like she always did. It was in that moment that Evan remembered why he didn\\'t do writing in the cafeteria and collected his things to move towards his math class. ... Daisy gripped onto her bright blue pen and tried her best to focus on Mrs. Castillo\\'s lecture. But, she was failing. Miserably. Her miserable concentration was to the point that she didn\\'t even know what in the world Mrs. Castillo was talking about. She felt horrible because Mrs. Castillo was one of her favorite teachers (even though science was never her strong suit) and she hated that she might disappoint the teacher by her not paying attention. She hoped, desperately, that Evan would at least have some clue as to what the lecture was going on about. She tried to focus on anything . Mrs. Castillo\\'s maroon dress looked excellent on her, especially when coupled with her short hair curled. There were five chalkboards around the classroom, but Daisy had noticed that Mrs. Castillo only liked to use the one at the front of the classroom unless she absolutely needed to. In addition, her teacher never used a textbook, only briefly referring to the notes in front of her. Though, Daisy wasn\\'t surprised because she was a genius. The girl couldn\\'t believe that Mrs. Castillo gave up being a lawyer to become a high school science teacher. Damn it , she cursed to herself, you are supposed to be listening to the teacher, not listing facts about her. Turns out, she began focusing on her words at the wrong time. \"Mr. Castillo, what is the answer to number 3?\" And, there goes whatever minuscule concentration she had managed to wrack up. She had tried with all of her might to focus her concentration on her teacher. But, two rows back and one row to her right, that was where her concentration really was. All wrapped up in the tangled web that was Phillip Castillo. Like the rest of the classroom, she pivoted toward him. He was blinking up at his mother in surprise and hesitantly asked which question. When his mother repeated the number of the question as well as the page number, he quickly flipped to the page and quickly read through the question. By the time he looked up, he answered the question with a shocking accuracy and his mother simply nodded her head, continuing on with her lecture. While the rest of the classroom returned to Mrs. Castillo, Daisy found her eyes trained still on Phillip. Immediately following answering the question, Phillip crossed his arms on the desk and rested his chin against his arms. Today, the baseball player was dressed in a black tee with a pair of denim jeans. His hair was rumpled up from practice this morning. He seemed to send out an aura of uncomfortable and annoyed. He chewed on his lip as he looked around the room, seemingly having as much concentration as she did. His brown eyes flickered over towards her. He held her gaze. There was a look in his eyes that she couldn\\'t identify. Her breath caught in her throat. \"Ms. Evans,\" Mrs. Castillo spoke. Daisy pivoted towards the teacher, fearing that she would ask her a question about today\\'s lecture. However, her teacher gave her a look of pity and decided not to ask her a question. \"Please, pay attention.\" Daisy nodded her head, blushing profusely and bent down to write notes. However, her concentration was shot multiple times over so she simply resorted to doodling flowers and hearts in the margins of her notebook. She\\'d definitely have to get the notes from Evan. A piece of paper slid off of Evan\\'s notebook and managed to tuck itself beneath the corner of her own notebook. It was a small square of paper that was torn from the upper corner of his own notes and his penmanship was scrawled across the page. Are you okay? The answer was no. She couldn\\'t sleep last night partially because of her recurring nightmares of the accident that brought her to Albuquerque and East High in the first place. Sometimes, if she managed to tire herself out enough, the nightmares wouldn\\'t come. Sometimes, they didn\\'t come at all. But, now, even nine months later, it was still fresh whenever the nightmare decided to worm it\\'s ugly head back into her self-conscious. It terrified her, forced her to wake up shaking and terrified, imagining for a brief moment that she was back in a hospital room with a woman she didn\\'t recognize. But, she always woke up in her bed at the Leverett\\'s house. However, something else kept her up last night. Her aunt had come home later than normal. Daisy and Evan had cooked dinner with Uncle Peyton while Tiana had sat at the bar doing homework. When Aunt Shar had arrived home, her husband moved to kiss her and helped her put the bag containing revisions for the musical in the living room. Evan had jokingly asked where she had been to miss Daisy\\'s rendition of one of the songs in the musicals. Daisy had hit her cousin in the shoulder when Aunt Shar stated the truth. She was at the hospital visiting Daisy\\'s father. \" Also, Evan, I need you to work with Phillip and Lucille after school. They\\'re auditioning for the musical together.\" She had dropped it so casually that she hadn\\'t expected the blank reaction from Daisy or the loud reaction from Evan. Aunt Shar didn\\'t know what she was unleashing. For the rest of the night, Daisy\\'s homework lay forgotten as her over-active, irrational mind played through every possible combination of events leading up to Phillip Castillo singing with Lucille Bolton. And, then, when she finally did manage to go to sleep, she woke up to the fresh nightmare and couldn\\'t go back to sleep. \"Ms. Bolton.\" The class (and Daisy) pivoted towards Lucille, who sat beside her Chemistry partner. But, Daisy realized something was different. Her head was down, her brown curls falling around her face and obscuring the view around her. There was a gray beanie on her head. She had worn a beige sweater with a pair of gray leggings, but the heat of the classroom had caused her to push up the sleeves to her elbows. Her hands were clenched around her red pen to the point that her knuckles were almost white. Concerned, Phillip reached out to touch her arm only for her to jerk away from him, closer to her body. Suddenly, her chair made a loud sound when it crashed on the floor and Lucille was pushing the back door of the classroom open. The door had barely managed to swing back into its spot before Evelyn was out of her chair as well, shouting her name down the hallway as she ran after her friend. Daisy glanced towards Mrs. Castillo, who had a troubled expression on her face. Then, she wrote over a list of problems on the board for them to do. Before the teacher left the classroom, she grabbed both Evelyn and Lucille\\'s bags, \"I am going to have Mrs. Fields listen in on the class while I am gone. If the entire class becomes too rowdy, this assignment will become a quiz and be worth forty percent of your grade. I will be back as soon as I can. Phillip, go ahead and sit with Daniel.\" Her son nodded, collecting his stuff and moving two rows up to sit with the Danforth. The latter of the two looked like he was about to bolt outside of the class, too. Phillip glanced towards the door his mother departed out of. After she left, Daisy couldn\\'t help thinking that she wasn\\'t the only one upset that Phillip Castillo was singing with Lucille Bolton and wondered if the brunette was going to be okay. ... Damn, Evelyn thought as she struggled to catch up from the fleeing brunette. She\\'s quicker than I thought she was. The blue-haired girl continued her pursuit down the halls of East High until she spotted Lucille duck into the bathroom up ahead. Evelyn increased her run time until she collided with the door of the bathroom, pushing it open so hard it rebounded against the wall. The bathroom looked the same as any other bathroom in the school. The only major difference was the fact that Lucille was huddled in the corner, her sobs overtaking the room and rebounding off the walls. Without thinking, Evelyn ran to Lucille\\'s side, dropping to the floor too early and sliding along the tile to her side. Her jeans saved her from having scratches on her knees; but, at this moment, the only thing Evelyn could think about was helping her friend. Lucille was sobbing, struggling to breathe as she curled herself in the tightest ball that she could make so she could occupy the least amount of space possible. Her sobs were overtaking her body, stunting her breathing. She buried her face into her knees and dug her nails into the exposed skin on her forearm so hard that she broke through her skin. Evelyn was by her side in an instant, pulling her nails from where she was breaking the skin and trying to get her to unravel, even a little bit, to help with her breathing. \" Breathe ,\" Evelyn pressed as she collapsed down in front of her. Evelyn gripped her hands to stop her from continuing to make scratches on her skin. Lucille gripped back on her hands, but didn\\'t look up from her knees \"Come on, you gotta breathe.\" Lucille\\'s head nodded, only barely. \"Come on, breathe in, deeply, through your nose.\" She heard Lucille breathe deeply through her nose, but the brunette soon hiccuped and the spell was broken. \"I can\\'t,\" Lucille cried. \"No, no, no,\" Evelyn shushed. \"It\\'s okay. Try again. Come on, breathe in deeply through your nose.\" Lucille did as told, her sobs still partially continued but they were muffled now. \"There you go. Now, exhale out your mouth.\" Evelyn heard the unsteady exhale from Lucille. Her breath waved, showing that she was still overcome with emotion. Evelyn closed her eyes, wishing it was final period. She would ditch Write Club to take her home because obviously school wasn\\'t the best place for her friend at this particular moment. \"Do it again,\" Evelyn ordered, gripping her hands in encouragement. Lucille nodded her head, breathing in and exhaling out her mouth. She did it a couple more times before her breath became even and steady. Lucille swallowed before pulling her face from her knees and leaning back against the cool tile of the bathroom wall. Her cheeks were puffy and tear-stained. The whites of her eyes had turned to a pink color from the number of tears that she had cried. After waiting a couple moments to make sure that Lucille was okay, Evelyn scrambled to her feet, pulling a paper towel from the dispenser and wet it in the sink. She handed it over to the girl on the floor who gingerly took it. \"You shouldn\\'t have followed me out,\" Lucille voiced as Evelyn slid down the wall to rejoin her on the floor. The brunette reached up with the paper towel to wipe at her cheeks. \"Now, Mrs. Castillo is going to punish both of us for leaving in the middle of her class.\" Evelyn didn\\'t say anything as Lucille examined the self-inflicted marks on her skin. She sighed heavily, placing the paper towel on the one that was bleeding. Lucille chuckled, though Evelyn wasn\\'t for sure why. \"You can say something, you know, Evelyn?\" \"I know,\" Evelyn spoke. \"But, I\\'ve been in those situations before. I want to be there to help my friends.\" Lucille smiled. It was a weak smile, but it was a smile all the same. \"Thank you,\" she spoke, honestly. She reached up towards her neck, pulling at the chain that was barely visible. She pulled out a necklace and looked down at it. It was a simple necklace, with a circular silver pendant. There was a treble clef etched into the metal. Evelyn blinked down at the necklace in confusion. Why did it seem so familiar to her? \"When my mother knew that my brother and I were going to be separated for the first time, she bought us these necklaces. She said that the necklaces meant that no matter how far apart we were, we would always be connected.\" Evelyn smiled. \"That\\'s really sweet.\" \"We\\'re twins,\" Lucille spoke. \"So, we always did things together. When I decided to transfer out of the drama-focused school and to my dad\\'s public school, we were going to different schools for the first time. It was hard, but we still lived together, you know? But, now…\" she trailed off, biting her lip. \"What is it?\" Evelyn questioned. \"I\\'m not supposed to tell anyone,\" she replied. \"But, I really want to talk about it.\" \"You don\\'t have to tell me,\" Evelyn spoke. \"Not if you aren\\'t supposed to talk about it.\" Lucille\\'s quiet. \"I can\\'t explain it,\" she spoke, glancing up at her. \"But, I feel like I can trust you with it.\" Evelyn nodded. \"If you still feel that way, tell me later, okay?\" Lucille nodded. With one last long look, she placed the necklace back beneath the fabric of her shirt before looking at the other end of the bathroom. Suddenly, the door opened to reveal Mrs. Castillo walking into the bathroom. There was an amused look on her face that had to have been from the panicked looks that Evelyn and Lucille had at the sight of her. She walked over to the two of them, handing them their backpacks that they left in the classroom. \"Go home,\" she ordered. Lucille blinked. \"Huh?\" Mrs. Castillo let out a light chuckle as she crouched down in front of them. \"Go home, Lucille,\" she spoke. \"I\\'ve already talked to the Office and I don\\'t think you are going to benefit from a school day. So, go home, get some rest, and think about the musical, okay?\" Lucille opened her mouth to protest, but quickly shut her mouth and simply nodded. Mrs. Castillo turned towards Evelyn. \"Make sure she gets home okay,\" she ordered. Evelyn nodded her head, opening her bag and glancing in it. \"And, you are allowed to take the rest of the day off as well. I don\\'t believe that Lucille should be alone at the house.\" Evelyn wasn\\'t going to leave her alone anyways. But, at least, she wouldn\\'t have another unexcused absence on her attendance record. \"Yes, Mrs. Castillo.\" \"Do all even problems on page 154 and bring it into me first thing tomorrow morning tomorrow morning, understood?\" The girls nodded as Mrs. Castillo stood on her feet. Lucille scrambled up from the bathroom tile and reached out a hand to Evelyn. The blue-haired girl took her hand and was immediately pulled onto her feet. Mrs. Castillo gave them an encouraging smile as they moved to leave. Suddenly, Lucille turned around, her feet squeaking on the tile. \"My dad,\" she started. Mrs. Castillo shook her head. \"I\\'ll tell him. I\\'m sure he of all people will understand.\" Lucille nodded her head. \"Thank you, Mrs. Castillo.\" Lucille turned back towards Evelyn, who had already opened the door into the hallway and had it propped open with her hip. Lucille headed out of the bathroom and Evelyn followed after her, holding open the door for Mrs. Castillo. The teacher followed after them but went back to her classroom while the girls headed for Evelyn\\'s car. ... Matty was allergic to seafood. Yet, the stage manager for next week\\'s showings was insisting on ordering seafood for the weekend. There would be numerous amounts of hours spent at the stadium from setting up the band to rehearsals to make sure that the concert goes on perfectly without any mishaps or to prevent possible mishaps. Not even to mention his studies in between practices and rehearsals. So, Matty didn\\'t have time to leave the stadium to get McDonald\\'s or some other restaurant because the stage manager had decided to cater in seafood for the entirety of the week. \"I don\\'t know how many times I have to tell you, Matty cannot have seafood. If he has seafood, he can\\'t perform,\" Kelsi spoke, frustrated. She had never been a confrontational person (except for you know that one time, but even then, she was standing up for someone else). But, after an hour of the same thing, her frustration and anger were seeping into her voice. She was on the verge of calling the record label because they seemed to have more power than she did. One phone call from the record label threatening to shut down the show and she\\'d get her way. Her son wasn\\'t going to the hospital on her watch. \"I don\\'t know about you, Ms. Nielsen, but back in my day, people listened to their parents and just ate the food. Kids, these days, ma\\'am. They\\'ll do anything to get out of it.\" She couldn\\'t help the sigh that escaped her lips. \"It isn\\'t that he hates seafood. It\\'s because of the fact that if he does eat seafood, his throat swells up to the point that he can\\'t breathe,\" she spoke, as calmly as possible. \"Ms. Nielsen,\" he started. \"Change the food or we are going to cancel the shows at your stadium,\" she spoke, calmly. She had finally snapped. She was tired of this conversation and she was tired of the person on the other end of the phone assuming that she was a pushover mom who let her son have whatever he wanted simply because he was a world pop star. There was silence on the other end. Then, \"Yes, Ms. Nielsen.\" \"Good,\" she spoke. Then, she hung up the call, discarding the cellular device on the nearest bed. \"Maybe, I should\\'ve done the phone call, Mom,\" Matty spoke from his bed on the other end of the room. Kelsi pivoted to find her son, resting his head against the pillows and reading something on his phone. She smiled as she watched him, being reminded immensely of her husband. While Matty bared some resemblance to her, no one could deny that he looked like a clone of her husband when they stood side-by-side. Matty inherited his grandfather\\'s dark brown hair, but his eyes were the same bright blue. Even dressed in a pair of jeans and a t-shirt, it seemed to drive home the resemblance home. \"I could\\'ve thrown a temper tantrum and everything.\" \"And give the paparazzi more fuel that you\\'re an egotistical pop star?\" Kelsi questioned. He grinned at her. \"Come on, Mom,\" he spoke. \"You know that the only people I care about already know that I\\'m the furthest thing from that.\" He let out a sigh as he cocked his head to the side. \"Besides, that stage manager was giving you a hard time.\" She rolled her eyes at her son\\'s admission, knowing full well it was true. She turned back towards the schedule in front of her, which contained the press tours and the interview dates. Then, she glanced towards her husband\\'s message from yesterday. She had said that she would\\'ve tried to make it work, but she wasn\\'t for sure how she could manage to move things around. How in the world were they going to manage to go to a wedding with their (well, technically, her son\\'s) hectic schedule? There was a shrill, piercing ring of a phone that threw Kelsi out of her concentration. Within moments, it was picked up and she heard her son\\'s joyous tone as he spoke, \"Hey, Danny! How\\'s preparing for the Championship Game? That\\'s coming up soon, right?\" There\\'s silence for a few moments as Kelsi wrote down notes for possible rearrangements. \"Hey, hey, hey, Danny... you need to slow down and explain. What\\'s going on? Is everything okay?\" Kelsi turned towards her son, who was now sitting up in bed. There was a worried expression on his face. All thought of rearranging the schedule was thrown out the window at the sight of her son\\'s face contorting into an expression that was a deep worry and rage. Matty reached up to touch at his necklace which he shared a matching one with his sister. His eyebrows furrowed together. His voice was almost angry when he finally spoke, though she was unsure who he was angry at, \"What do you mean something has happened with Lucille?\" OOOOO. Next chapter, we\\'re still going to be dealing with Lucille\\'s aftermath of the whole musical situation and begin to dive into Phillip\\'s afterthought to the musical auditions. I could\\'ve made it easy and have them both accept the musical audition, but I think it would\\'ve been a repeat of the original story so I like the idea of them \"fighting\" the possibility of being in the musical, at least for a little bit. What did you guys think? Let me know with a review (or a private message, if you want to do that) or by hitting that favorite/follow button. I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter and I hope you guys stick around for the next chapter. See you next week! (Hopefully.)'][Chapter 5] ['Okay, so I didn\\'t get a chance to upload this chapter last week and I greatly apologize. But, I started school back up a few weeks ago so I\\'ve been trying to keep up to date with homework assignments and friends and social lives, etc. You know how it goes, right? Anyways, we\\'re back with another chapter and that\\'s awesome. Now, like the chapter states, there is a bunch of heavy talks in the chapter so be warned. I hope you guys stick around until the very end. Also, these chapters keep getting longer and longer and I don\\'t really mean them to get so long but I don\\'t think you guys mind? Disclaimer: I do not own any characters recognizable to the High School Musical trilogy franchise. Another High School Musical Chapter Five: Home Movies and Heavy Talks \"Troy!\" The basketball-slash-history teacher jumped at the sound of his coworker\\'s voice, shouting his name. It was only ten minutes since the final bell had rung but the halls were completely empty as though it had been hours. Students had already flooded and abandoned the hallways and were now locked in a hysterical game of \"who can squeeze through the gap\" traffic in an attempt to escape the school grounds and head home. Only a few students remained, at various afterschool activities (including after school detention) or simply waiting until the traffic slowed. Troy should\\'ve still been on the basketball court with the members of the East High and West High basketball teams (for yet another scrimmage). But, he had requested the assistant coach to take over because he had an important meeting to take care of. And, it was important. For the first time in high school, Troy Bolton was going to confront Sharpay (Evans) Leverett because she had gone too far. Except, this time, it was Troy\\'s daughter who was caught in the crossfire. \"I can\\'t talk right now-\" \"It\\'s about Lucille,\" Gabriella cut him off before he could continue. Troy turned towards her. The black-haired woman crossed her arms across her chest and raised an eyebrow at him. \"I\\'ve been looking for you since lunch,\" she spoke. \"I knocked on your door and went down to the locker room to try and find you. I even tracked down my husband, got your number, and texted you. But, I couldn\\'t find you anywhere.\" Troy blinked. \"You did?\" \"Yes,\" Gabriella spoke. \"Where were you?\" \"I was in my room,\" Troy answered, sticking his hands in his pockets. \"You must\\'ve visited while I was heating up my leftovers… or while I was grading papers. Lucky always complains that I get in my own world when I grade.\" He turned back to her as she nodded. \"So, what happened with Lucille?\" Gabriella deflated. \"She had a breakdown in class today.\" Troy tensed, exhaling a breath. Then, he dropped his head and ran a hand through his hair, gripping the strands harder than he normally would\\'ve of. He linked his fingers together behind his head. Goddammit, he thought. He should\\'ve checked his phone. He always kept his phone in the drawer of his desk and didn\\'t pull it out until after the school day was over. \"Where is she?\" he questioned. He needed to get her home as soon as he could. The team would understand. \"At home,\" she replied. Troy looked up at her. \"I sent her home.\" \"What? Lucille doesn\\'t drive. And, she doesn\\'t know the area well enough yet to walk home yet especially in an emotional state. What do you mean you sent her home?\" Troy snapped. He quickly realized what he did and was thankful that Gabriella didn\\'t seem bothered by his outburst. In fact, she was waiting for him to stop. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he spoke. \"I don\\'t know what got into me.\" \"You\\'re protective,\" she stated. \"You always have been. I, of all people, should know.\" Troy let out a light chuckle. \"Don\\'t worry about her for right now, I sent Evelyn home with her. After Lucille ran from the classroom, Evelyn chased after her. I talked to the Office before I found them. They let me sent both of them home with an excused absence.\" Troy breathed, a weight lifted off his shoulders. Good. She isn\\'t alone. \"That\\'s good,\" Troy spoke. \"Thank you, Gabriella.\" \"It\\'s not a problem, Troy,\" she replied. \"She is my student too, you know. And, I care for all my students. Plus, I know from personal experience that being alone after a breakdown is not the best thing for anyone. So, I was going to send Evelyn with her, regardless.\" Troy nodded. \"Where are you going?\" \"Same as you, I suppose,\" Gabriella responded. She looked past his shoulder and moved to go around him, walking in the direction she was going. Troy walked beside her as the woman crossed her arms again, a serious and determined look crossing her features. \"Getting Lucille out of the musical.\" Troy nodded his head, reaching out to grab the doorknob into Sharpay\\'s room and held open the door for her so she could go by. … \"And, now, you know,\" Lucille whispered, playing with the bracelet on her wrist. The minutes counted down on the microwave was the only sound that was going on between the two of them as Lucille heated up some leftover Olive Garden for the both of them. She snuck a glance towards Evelyn, who was leaning against the door frame of the incredibly large kitchen. The blue-haired girl opened her mouth then closed it as though she struggled with the words. \"I don\\'t know why I\\'m so surprised,\" Evelyn admitted. \"The two of you look alike.\" Lucille scoffed as the microwave went off. \"I look nothing like my mother.\" Evelyn rolled her eyes as Lucille pulled the leftover fettuccine alfredo from the microwave. She swirled around the noodles before placing it back into the microwave for another minute. Lucille leaned against the island as she crossed her arms over her chest. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do about this musical audition,\" Lucille confessed. She glanced over at Evelyn, who opened the door to the fridge and pulled out the Coca-Cola. Lucille grabbed two plastic Berkley cups from the dishwasher and handed them over. Evelyn filled them up with ice before pouring soda into them. \"Like, I seriously don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do.\" Evelyn leaned against the counter. \"Well, what do you want to do?\" she questioned. The microwave went off and Lucille rescued the leftovers from the heat. She placed the pan on the stovetop and distributed the noodles on two different plates. She handed one over to Evelyn, who took the plate eagerly. \"I mean, I\\'ve never heard you sing. But, I don\\'t see how someone who spent six years at the Los Angeles Academy of the Dramatic Arts and then was the lead in two musical productions at a public school is a bad singer.\" Lucille shrugged her shoulders. \"Plus,\" she added. \"I\\'m sure that you can do anything that you set your eye on. If that\\'s what you really want to do.\" Lucille let out a heavy sigh. \"I know,\" the brunette spoke as she swirled the noodles around her fork. \"That\\'s what my dad always taught us. But, there\\'s a part of me that\\'s afraid…\" she trailed off and Evelyn looked up at her. \"There\\'s a part of me that is afraid that Liam is right…\" Before Evelyn could speak, the front door opened. Lucille jumped, glancing at the clock because there was no way that her father could be home already . He had another afternoon scrimmage today with the West High Knights before their big game in three weeks\\' time. But, then there\\'s a woman\\'s voice that drifted into the house. \"Lucille, are you home yet?\" \"Nana?\" Lucille called back. \"I\\'m in the kitchen!\" \"Nana?\" Evelyn spoke, confused. Lucille turned towards her. Before Lucille even opened her mouth to explain, there was a look of realization on her face as she leaned her head against her hand. \"Well, nevermind, I guess that makes sense.\" Lucille let out a light laugh as her grandmother walked into the kitchen. Like normal, her grandmother was dressed in clothes that flowed around her. This time it was a blue shirt with an intricate black pattern and a pair of black slacks. Her graying-blonde hair was pinned on the back of her head. She had an orange-and-blue scarf wrapped around her shoulders and beaded bracelets on her wrist. With her, she carried a box. \"Evelyn,\" her grandmother spoke, spotting the girl at the bar. Evelyn waved at her. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Oh,\" Evelyn spoke, carefully trying to lift a fork of noodles. \"I brought Lucille home and I was going to stay with her until her dad came home, Ms. Darbus.\" Her grandmother moved to say something before Lucille cut her off, \"Nana, she knows.\" Alyson Darbus turned towards her granddaughter with wide eyes. Then, the woman nodded her head and didn\\'t refute her even after she placed the box on the counter. \"What is that?\" Lucille questioned. \"I heard about the auditions from your father,\" her grandmother spoke, patting the box. \"While I think that you should do it, I also think that you need to make that decision for yourself. And, I think since you\\'ve been in the hospital, you don\\'t know who that is anymore. I brought these to help you.\" Lucille blinked. \"What are they?\" She took the box from her grandmother and peeled at the tape that kept the box shut. Once the box was open, she peered down to a lot of DVDs and a handful of pictures. She pulled out a handful of them to read the descriptions. But, the only thing on the DVDs was her mother\\'s scrawl of different dates. \"These are all home movies that your mother shot in high school and at college,\" the older woman responded. With a groan and a shaky landing, Evelyn slid off the barstool. She moved over to the box, pulling out some pictures and looking through them. Lucille grabbed the DVD cases and looked through them. \"And, some photos. I thought that they might be helpful to help you discover your voice again.\" Lucille nodded her head, feeling her grandmother\\'s hand on her head before feeling her press a kiss on the top of her head. \"Do you want to watch them with me?\" Lucille questioned. \"I\\'d be happy too,\" her grandmother spoke. \"Can I watch them too?\" Evelyn piped up. \"Of course.\" Evelyn nodded her head, smiling at the photos. As Lucille shifted through the DVDs, attempting to find the earliest one, Evelyn looked through a couple of photos. \"Look, I think this is you, Lucille,\" she spoke. The brunette glanced over. Her eyes furrowed. On the photo, there was a woman with short dark brown hair and bright blue eyes, holding a sleeping baby in her arms. She looked sickly and thin. Below, it said Lucille on the twins\\' birthday . She bit her lip. It was hard to tell which of them it was when they were that little. \"No,\" Ms. Darbus spoke. Lucille turned towards her grandmother. She was leaning against the counter, gripping onto the edge. She reached out and Evelyn gave her the photo. \"The baby is her brother,\" she informed Evelyn. The blue-haired girl nodded her head and listened intently. \"The woman in the photo is Lucille\\'s other grandmother and her namesake.\" The older woman was sad as she said that. \"Nana,\" Lucille spoke. \"You don\\'t have to talk about it. I can tell her.\" Ms. Darbus shook her head. \"No, it\\'s okay, Lucky,\" she whispered. The curly haired brunette nodded her head. \"Lucille was sick when my daughter and son-in-law found out that they were pregnant. She had cancer, you see, but she had been in remission for a few years. But, when my daughter was in her second trimester, her cancer came back and it was stage four. She only had a few months to live.\" She glanced at the photo. \"She died when the twins were a couple months old.\" Evelyn bit her lip. \"I\\'m so sorry,\" she spoke. Ms. Darbus nodded. \"It hit Jack the hardest,\" she responded. \"But, he had his grandchildren to help him pull through. He started calling them his \\'Lucky Charms\\'.\" She chuckled. Lucille laughed and Evelyn looked at them with wide eyes. \"Wait,\" the blue-haired girl spoke, practically grinning from ear-to-ear. \" That\\'s where \\'Lucky\\' comes from?\" Ms. Darbus nodded her head, chuckling to herself as she grabbed a handful of photos. \"Lucille was born first so she was dubbed Lucky while her brother was given the name Charms. We\\'ve called her brother \\'Charms\\' for so long that he\\'s embraced it. Together, they were Jack\\'s lucky charms.\" Evelyn crossed her arms, grinning. \"I must say, that wasn\\'t what I was expecting.\" Then, there was a flash of realization in her face. Lucille watched her reach for her phone and unlock it with a serious expression on her face. Then, she stared at it for a long time before she looked up again, a thoughtful expression on her face. Lucille blinked. \"Are you okay?\" Evelyn blinked at her as though she had even forgotten that Lucille and her grandmother were even there. \"Yeah,\" Evelyn responded. \"I just realized something about my story is all.\" \"That\\'s good.\" … From the moment the door creaked open, Sharpay was pulled back in high school. It must\\'ve been the fact that Troy and Gabriella walked in side-by-side. It might\\'ve been the feeling in the pit of her stomach about the conversation was ahead. Or, it could\\'ve been from the fact that the mere sight of them, walking together into her classroom looked exactly like they used to when she did something. If she hadn\\'t just been talking to Peyton about her worries about Ryan and his possible …, well, she might\\'ve thought that she was magically transported back to 2007. \"What is it?\" Sharpay questioned, moving to stand from her desk. Her room had once been Ms. Darbus\\'s old room. Even after Sharpay added more pink hues and numerous motivational posters plastered on the walls, she kept the stage and simply put her desk on it instead. Even the desks still took on the same formation. There was a part of her that still craved being the center of attention, but her choice to keep the stage stemmed from the fact that she could see everyone\\'s desk when she stood on the stage or sat on her desk. \"And, why does it look like the two of you are about to yell at me?\" Gabriella glanced toward Troy. The latter of which was leaning against the desk where his old spot used to be. \"Sharpay, we came to talk about getting Lucille out of the musical auditions.\" Sharpay blinked as she stepped down from the stage. \"Why?\" \"Sharpay, she needs to be out of the musical,\" Troy spoke. Gabriella turned towards Troy. \"She just needs a reason to understand why we need to take her out. I didn\\'t tell her about Lucille\\'s incident either.\" Tell me what? Sharpay glanced towards her best friend, who locked eyes with her briefly from the corner of her eye. \"I didn\\'t want you to hear from the other teachers or other students.\" \"She needs to be out of the musical.\" \"Why?\" Sharpay questioned. \"Because, she just needs to be, okay?\" Troy responded. \"That isn\\'t a good enough answer,\" Sharpay spoke. \" Shar.\" \"No, Gabriella,\" Sharpay responded, crossing her arms over her chest and turning towards her best friend. \"I want to know why Lucille needs to be out of the musical because I am missing something that the two of you know about. I want to know a good reason why I should take Lucille off the auditions board. I\\'ve looked at her record. She\\'s had years of drama and she even attended a school that specifies in the dramatic arts. I would love to have her in the drama club.\" \"I don\\'t think it\\'s that simple, Shar.\" \"She can\\'t be in it,\" Troy spoke, his voice guarded. \"Why?\" Sharpay questioned. \"Because she can\\'t ,\" Troy responded. Sharpay didn\\'t think she had never seen Troy look the way she did now. And, she had known Troy for a long time. His body language was rigid and cold as though he was barely holding himself together. Sharpay knew that she shouldn\\'t push it and there was a part of her that knew that something bigger than the three of them was going on. But, she needed to know, she needed to hear him say it. She had seen Lucille singing in that music room. The girl moved to the music and had sung to her heart\\'s content. And, she had seen the look on the girl\\'s face. Singing with Phillip had made her happy . It was the kind of deliriously happy, the kind of happy that came around when you needed it the most, the kind of happy that came through only when you were enjoying what you were doing. Lucille enjoyed singing. Lucille was singing because she wanted to. So, why was Troy trying to take her out of it? \"Why?\" Sharpay pressed. And, then, whatever composure Troy Bolton had completely cracked when he shouted, \"I don\\'t know!\" His voice broke Sharpay\\'s heart and, from the look on her face, Gabriella\\'s too. It was cracked as though he was holding back tears and emotions. His shoulders fell, his entire body hunched over, and he avoided the gaze of the women around him. He didn\\'t apologize for his outburst, but he didn\\'t need to. One of his hands stuck in his pocket while the other reached up, rubbing his face and pinching his eyes closed. When he spoke again, his voice was much softer this time and, if possible, more defeated, \"I don\\'t know…\" Sharpay glanced over at Gabriella, who returned her gaze. She didn\\'t know either. Neither of the other teachers talked or tried to press him for more information, but Troy explained without any prompting, avoiding their gaze as he did so, \"About six months ago, we got a call from a hospital about thirty minutes away from our house. Lucille had been admitted to the hospital while at a competition. Something happened to her and no one had any answers. Her brother had gotten there first. He was closer. And, by the time that my wife and I managed to get there, she had clammed up and refused to speak to anyone.\" Gabriella covered her mouth. Sharpay had a sinking feeling in the pit her stomach, but she tried not to let it show on her face. \"We tried to figure out what happened, especially after … after she quit the drama club, but she wouldn\\'t tell. She only clammed up further. I always had a feeling that my son knew what happened, but he refused to tell us either. So, after a while, we stopped asking and she started opening up again. And, we want to know how to help her, but we decided to give her the space she needs…\" he trailed off. \"And, hope that she\\'ll tell you one day?\" Gabriella filled in. Troy nodded his head, lowering it soon after. \"I\\'m sure Lucille knows how much you are worried about her,\" Gabriella started. \"She knows that you are worried about her. But, I think you need to talk to her about it.\" \"Don\\'t.\" Gabriella pivoted towards Sharpay. She looked at the blonde with a look of confusion as though she didn\\'t know where she was going. Then, it was as though something clicked in her mind and showed in her eyes, but she kept quiet. Even, Troy glanced up towards Sharpay, a look of confusion on his face as he stared at her. He glanced towards Gabriella, before returning to his gaze towards the blonde drama teacher. \"There\\'s no need to ruin your relationship with your daughter by pushing her to talk about something that she doesn\\'t want to talk about,\" Sharpay spoke. \"I believe I can say that from personal experience.\" Troy\\'s eyes searched hers for the answer, glancing at Gabriella who gave him a look. \"Let me talk to her,\" Sharpay spoke. \"Huh?\" Troy spoke. \"Lucille,\" she elaborated. \"Let me talk to Lucille about the musical.\" Troy moved to open his mouth, but Sharpay raised her hand to stop him before he could interrupt. \"No, listen to me,\" she continued. \"When I told her that I wanted her to audition for the musical, she didn\\'t outright refuse me which might\\'ve been because she was confused about the scenario. Or, it might be because she\\'s conflicted about the situation. But, if she doesn\\'t want to audition for the musical, I want her to tell me about it. Not her loveable, meaningful, but overprotective father.\" Troy nodded his head. Sharpay stepped closer, grabbing his arm. Troy glanced up to her with a bewildered expression. \"I promise,\" she spoke, trailing off. She gathered her nerves in her stomach and stared at him with a renewed sense of confidence. \"I promise that I have learned from my mistakes, Troy. And that I won\\'t force Lucille to do something that she doesn\\'t want to do.\" Sharpay did a lot of things in high school that she had come to regret. All of which was to get Troy as her boyfriend. In high school, she had a warped sense of belonging. She thought that because she was the top girl at East High, she should\\'ve been with Troy Bolton, who was arguably the top boy at the same time. She was a spoiled girl and she had gotten her rude awakening once she moved to New York City for the first time and she had learned her lesson about trying to force situations when Ryan fell out of her life. And, that was the thing that had changed Sharpay\\'s mindset the most: Ryan leaving. She wouldn\\'t make that mistake twice. She won\\'t let Troy make that mistake and lose someone he really cared about. \"Okay,\" Troy spoke. \"I\\'ll tell her. If she wants to be out of the musical, she\\'ll talk to you.\" Sharpay nodded her head, dropping her arm and wrapping it around her body as she did so. Troy made a remark about how he needed to get back to the gym and left shortly afterward, the door to the hallway swinging shut behind him. For a minute, the two frenemies-turned-best-friends stood in silence in the classroom where their old homeroom was. Then, Gabriella\\'s hand was on her shoulder and she whispered, \"What are thinking about, Shar?\" And, the blonde choked out. \"I just don\\'t want him to make the same mistake I did with Ryan.\" Gabriella was quiet, wrapping her arms around Sharpay, who instinctively leaned into her best friend\\'s embrace and heard her whisper, \"Yeah, I don\\'t either.\" … Phillip Castillo\\'s room wasn\\'t anything special. His twin sized bed was shoved into a corner, a small nightstand held a handful of pictures. There was one of him and Evan when they were twelve at a swim park. Another picture was of the most recent Thanksgiving at his grandmother\\'s house with all three grandchildren, his mother, and his father. Other than the schedule for the baseball games and a handful of movie posters and the handful of leftover Christmas lights after his window, his room was bare of anything else. His laptop sat on his bed and he had quickly deposited his book bag by the door before he collapsed on the bed, burying his face in the pillows. \"Phillip,\" his mother spoke. Phillip\\'s \"Go away\" was muffled by the sheets. \"What was that? I couldn\\'t hear you because you\\'re trying to suffocate yourself with your sheets.\" He turned his head, but only by a fraction so he could repeat, \"Go away.\" \"Come on, Phillip,\" she remarked. \"Dinner\\'s ready.\" \"I\\'m not hungry,\" Phillip informed her, flipping over to face her. His mother stood in the doorway with her arms crossed. She was dressed in a pair of sleep shorts and an East High shirt that had holes near the seam. Her hair was pulled into a ponytail on the back of her head. Despite his remark, he spotted the disbelieving look on her face before she even stepped inside and closed the door behind her. \"Mom, seriously, I\\'m fine.\" \"Phillip,\" she remarked. She crossed the room and pushed herself up on the bed beside him. He quickly scooted towards the headboard so she would have more room. \"I\\'m your mother and you are my first born. If you think I don\\'t know when you aren\\'t yourself, the only person you are fooling is yourself.\" She crossed her legs at her knees. \"Now, what\\'s wrong? Is this about the musical?\" Phillip glanced up at her. From the knowing but sad look on her face, he knew that she had hit the mark in terms of where he was feeling. He bit his lip and looked towards the window where the last remains of his Christmas lights were strung around the glass. \"I just don\\'t know what to do, Mom,\" he whispered. \"There\\'s a part of me that wants to do the audition for the musical just to try something new. But, Lucille and I were only singing the song that you used to sing me, Antonio, and Luisa. It was just the two of us. Aunt Shar wasn\\'t supposed to hear us. How am I supposed to sing in front of the entire school?\" \"I understand,\" she replied. \"I really do.\" Phillip knew that. He had heard his mother and Aunt Shar reminisce about their years in high school too many times. His mother was a transfer student who ended up auditioning for the musical with the captain of the basketball team. They broke the status quo and changed the school, but they fought for their positions. \"And, Lucille,\" Phillip spoke, his voice beginning to turn frantic. \"You can\\'t lie to me and say that her breakdown wasn\\'t because of the fact that she was signed up to audition for the musical.\" His mother reached out to place a hand on his own, which were wrung together on his lap. She forced his hands apart, slipping hers into his own. \"Yes, I believe that Lucille\\'s breakdown resulted from the fact she was signed up for the musical. But, I also know that her breakdown stemmed from something, but it was nothing that you did.\" Phillip thought of Lucille in Chemistry. She sat rigid in her seat, eyes down on the desk. She was rigid and still, flinching when he reached out to touch her arm. She had been still for a moment and then she took off running out the door. He thought of her after Aunt Shar found them in the music room, how she refused to look at him as she collected her things and left, how she ignored his desperate attempts to talk to her. He closed his eyes. \"She wouldn\\'t have sung if it wasn\\'t for me,\" Phillip responded. \"Phillip,\" his mother ordered. \" Stop ,\" He bit his lip to stop himself from rambling. This time, however, he drew blood, feeling the metallic taste along his lip. He dropped his eyes to their joined hands, avoiding his mother\\'s intense gaze. \"Stop doing this to yourself. Stop trying to blame yourself for everything that happens.\" Phillip is quiet. His vision is hazy. \"Maybe, I shouldn\\'t do it,\" he spoke to himself. His mother\\'s eyes flew up to him and she gave him a skeptical look. \"You were just saying a few minutes ago that you wanted to do it.\" \"Yeah, well…\" he trailed off as he avoided her gaze. \"Maybe, I should focus more on baseball or the scholastic decathlon, you know? Get money for scholarships and stuff like that…\" She reached out to take his hand. \"You\\'ll regret not doing the musical.\" \"Maybe,\" he spoke. \"I don\\'t even know if I\\'ll be able to do it, you know, and besides I might not…\" His mother cut him off before he could complete the thought. \"Don\\'t you dare say that you aren\\'t good enough.\" She reached up, taking his head in her hands and forced him to look at her. He shied away under her intense, protective gaze. \"You have always been good enough to do anything you ever wanted to accomplish and more.\" He bit his lip. Phillip didn\\'t dare fight her. Even after sixteen years of living, Phillip had never once won an argument against his mother. But, no matter how many times they fought about that one simple fact, it always seemed to seep into Phillip\\'s mind whenever he did anything . If you absolutely needed to stick a label on it, it was his worst fear: not being good enough. No matter how hard his mother tried to stop it or how hard Phillip wanted the thought out of his head, it always managed to stick and it unnerved the both of them. But, they always managed to persist. And, suddenly, his thoughts shifted to Daisy. He had been waiting for Daisy and Evan to arrive at school this morning. Daisy had immediately glanced at the board where his name was now written alongside Lucille\\'s. He had always been hyper-aware of her actions, but today, it seemed like she went into overdrive, waiting for her reaction. It was almost instantaneous that he identified her chest fallen stature. Then, she had brushed past him, ignoring him altogether, and headed towards the cafeteria. Evan looked at him in a way that should\\'ve been comforting. Except, it wasn\\'t. He decided to skip breakfast and ended up working on homework in the library. Evan didn\\'t join him and there was a part of him that feared that Evan was mad at him too. \"You know that your father and I don\\'t care about you getting scholarships or not,\" his mother cut through his thoughts. Phillip glanced up at her, suddenly aware that he had missed most of her speech. He nodded his head, looking back at his hands. \"We just want you to have fun while in high school, Phillip. We want you to do what you want to do. Not what some boards and random people think you should be doing.\" She reached out to touch his shoulder and Phillip breathed in deeply, closing his eyes. \"You know that your father and I will support you with anything that you choose to do,\" his mother spoke. He bit, harshly at his bottom lip. It was so harsh, harsher than the last time, that he could taste blood, a metallic taste. His tongue immediately moved to stop the bleeding. \"I\\'ve never been a singer, Mom,\" Phillip responded. \"I\\'m not a singer.\" \"But, you can be.\" But, he thought, I\\'ll never be good enough to be a singer . A sob startled both of them. The sob escaped from Phillip\\'s lips and he quickly brought up the jacket by his side to smother the sounds before his younger siblings heard. He didn\\'t need them worrying, or making fun of him, and he didn\\'t need to be crying. He didn\\'t need to be doing this right now, not with so much work that needed to be done. His mother reached out, he flinched at the touch, and she wrapped her arms around him. She brought him against her, tucking his head beneath her chin and holding him there as he cried. A hand ran through his hair. The motion was oddly comforting to him and he felt her fingers wipe the tears off of his cheeks. Even though he tried to get away from her, she held up, whispering in his ear that everything would be okay. But, would it? He had thought that he had finally managed to get his groove, balancing school and a semi-decent social life that might\\'ve included a girlfriend for the first time since freshman year, for the first time since Phillip became painfully aware that his family would struggle to put him through college. He had been balancing all AP courses and multiple after-school activities to build up his future college applications. And, his only real friend was Evan and a handful of other students in the same boat. And, he might\\'ve been even a few weeks away from finally asking Daisy out in a way that he wanted to since the moment that she came to New Mexico nine months ago. But, now, he ruined it all. If possible, the tears increased, though he wasn\\'t entirely sure what the tears were for. Were they for the fact that he knew he wasn\\'t good enough? Or, were they because of Daisy? Her defeated and sad eyes from Chemistry flashed in his mind. He caused that. He knew it. He thought that he finally managed to break through the large brick wall that her father had taught her to build and thought he had managed to break through the iron wall around her heart. But, he only seemed to help her reinforce it, building it higher and higher. What if I really am not good enough? \"Get it all out,\" his mother\\'s voice was briefly comforting. The door swung open at that moment and all he heard his mother\\'s voice become harsh as she ordered whoever it was out of the room in fast Spanish that he barely understood the meaning. He managed to chuckle, but only briefly before the sobs took over once again and he leaned into her embrace. The door opened again, but her mother didn\\'t order them out this time. \"Get it all out,\" she spoke, leaning her head against his own. There was a hand on his back. Phillip realized it was his father\\'s, stronger and larger than his mother\\'s hand. But, he was rubbing circles on his back, never wavering from his side. He felt one of his parents press a kiss against his forehead and felt his father\\'s head on his shoulder, a comforting gesture. \"Get it all out, Phillip,\" his father\\'s voice spoke. It earned another sob. \"I\\'ve always taught you that it\\'s okay to cry. Get it all out. It\\'ll make you feel better. I promise.\" ... Troy had gone to the hospital immediately after practice was over. His dad was furious at the prospect of spending one more night in the hospital, but Troy had all the paperwork in order so his mother-in-law could pick up his father from the hospital without much of a fuss. Because of his limited mobility, they would have to hire a nurse to help him while the other two occupants in the house were at school. Troy wasn\\'t worried about it. They had the money for it. But, his dad was angry about it, saying that he couldn\\'t wait until he could get out of the cast and stand on his own two feet again. Troy was exhausted and didn\\'t feel like arguing with him. So, after the doctor came in to talk to him and his dad, Troy headed home, saying that he needed to be with Lucille. And, once he got home, he found his mother-in-law resting on the couch with Lucille curled up beside her. His daughter\\'s head was pressed against her knee, her legs curled beneath her and a blanket over her. In the armchair, Evelyn was passed out as well. Her hair was pulled up into a ponytail, her legs were propped up on the coffee table and she seemed to have her arms wrapped around one of the throw pillows. Their chemistry books were on the table with papers stuffed between pages. From his spot curled on the back of the couch, their black cat, Salem, raised his head to glare at Troy. \"Hi Mom,\" Troy spoke, walking over to press a kiss against her cheek. \"Chemistry knocked the wind out of them,\" his mother-in-law explained, running her hand through Lucille\\'s curls. \"I was fixing to wake them up and send Evelyn home before her parents began to worry about her.\" Troy nodded his head, looking towards the television screen. He smiled at the sight of his high school friends on the screen. They were all sitting around in an ice cream parlor, laughing. He remembered it clearly. It was one of the last times they were all together before Gabriella left and they all spread out over the country. \"I brought all of her videos over for Lucille to watch. I thought that it might help.\" Troy nodded his head, feeling Salem brush against his arm. He reached up to pet the black cat\\'s head as he watched the television. The camera was focused on him, dressed in a white v-neck and a flannel over it. There was a bandana over his forehead and his arm was wrapped around Gabriella, who was leaning against his shoulder. He looked up, spotting the camera on him. Within moments, he was out of his seats. The laughter from the group was loud and joyous as the camera followed Troy. The holder of the camera was trying to run away from him but he dove, grabbing the holder of the camera and fighting for control. The camera shook, showing flashes of the group before it steadied held now by Troy. Now, the focus of the camera was now Kelsi. Her hair was long, brown and curly, spilling in waves unhindered by a hat in one of those rare instances. She had black framed glasses, a white shirt, and a yellow-gray striped cover-up. The camera looked down at her, but that was simply because of their height differences. She reached up for the camera and it was only held up higher to avoid her from getting the camera back. \" Troy!\" she snapped, but it\\'s a playful smile with no bite to her words. \" Give me back the camera.\" The video paused on her face, on her smile as she reached for the camera. Blinking back into reality, back into the living room, Troy felt a hand on his elbow and he looked to find his mother-in-law looking up at him with a knowing smile. \"You don\\'t have to be strong all the time, you know?\" \"Yeah, I do,\" he responded, looking away. He looked over towards Lucille, who was still asleep against the couch. \"I need to be strong for her.\" \"No, you don\\'t,\" his mother-in-law responded. She stood up, wrapping an arm around Troy briefly before moving into the kitchen. \"Your daughter knows that you are not strong all the time, Troy, and you don\\'t have to lie to her.\" Troy followed her into the kitchen where she pressed the start button on the Keurig and grabbed a pod of decaf coffee from the bin. \"You\\'re not alone in this endeavor.\" Troy glanced towards Lucille, who he could still barely see from his position in the kitchen, as the woman pulled a mug from the cabinet. \"You\\'ve got me, you\\'ve got your wife, you\\'ve got your father, and we\\'re all here for you,\" she spoke as she placed the pod in the coffee pot and closed the lid. With the push of one more button, the coffee maker stirred to life. \"And, that\\'s just talking about within the immediate family. You\\'ve also got Chad and Taylor.\" \"I know, Mom,\" he spoke. She turned around and gave him a look that practically screamed \\'really?\\' to which he grinned. \"Don\\'t worry. If it ever gets too much, I promise to call you or Dad to help me out.\" \"It\\'s okay not to be strong all of the time,\" she responded, moving back to the cup of coffee. \"If you ever need a place to scream, I think you know the perfect place to go.\" Troy let out a laugh. And, that\\'s the end of this chapter! I hope you guys enjoyed it and are willing to leave me a follow/favorite/review for this chapter! Next chapter, the focus is still mainly on Lucille and her view of the whole scenario. But, the chapter after that, we\\'re focusing on Phillip and him coming around to the idea of being in the musical. I feel like the movies didn\\'t talk about it until later so I really wanted to do this for this story. I hope you guys are okay with that! See you next time!'][Chapter 6] ['Hey, everyone! We\\'re back again with another chapter of \"Another High School Musical\". I apologize once again for taking a while to upload this chapter, but I have been swamped with homework (physics is kicking my butt). Hopefully to make up for it. Here\\'s an extra long chapter! And, there is another heavy talk in this chapter that involves Lucille and what happened to her. Caution: there is a pretty heavy scene with references to something that could be triggering. I have an author\\'s note before and after the session to show where it is blocked off. If you don\\'t feel comfortable when beginning to read the scene, go ahead and skip the section. I hope you guys enjoy the chapter! Disclaimer: I do not own any characters recognizable by the High School Musical franchise. Another High School Musical Chapter Six: The Bolton Family Evelyn thought that telling her parents that she was bisexual was a stressful situation to be in. But, she doesn\\'t think she\\'s ever been more stressed than she did while standing opposite of Troy Bolton. After spending the night over at the Bolton house and waking up sprawled across a guest bedroom that she didn\\'t recognize and managing to stumble to the living room to find her friend\\'s father handing her a cup of coffee, she was still a tad disoriented. But, she knew that the father had some questions for her. And then, Lucille stumbled down the stairs and interrupted what he seemed to desperately want to talk about. Evelyn had driven her car back to school. Evelyn didn\\'t know why she was so surprised to be the same size as Lucille. But, thankfully she was because it saved her a trip back to her own house to collect clothes and receive her mother\\'s lecture (though Mr. Bolton had assured that he smoothed it out with her mother, Evelyn was almost certain she would still receive a lecture when she finally returned home). So, Evelyn had opted to wear Lucille\\'s gray sweater and a pair of her black athletic leggings that only went to her mid-calf. With bright blue hair, it was always safest to go with neutral colors. Normally, she tried to add some splash of color to her clothes (unless it was the first two weeks after a break in which she wore all black to mourn the loss of her free time), but today, she didn\\'t care about color. Black and gray was just fine. But, in all honesty, the only thing Evelyn wanted to know was how Troy Bolton managed to get her phone number. And, how in the world he had such good timing to manage to text her right as she was walking in the front door of the building? The man must be psychic or something, Evelyn decided. 7:15 am Lucille went to the roof with Daniel. Can we talk real quick? -Troy Bolton . Evelyn sent back a quick confirmation and spend the walk over to the classroom adding the foreign phone number to her contacts. Once she arrived at the door, she attempted to open it only to find that the door was locked. She glanced up and saw a sign that said \\' Grading Papers. Please knock!\\' in the teacher\\'s handwriting. She reached up hesitantly knocking on the door. As she waited, she changed to another app and stared at the screentime of her longtime friend, CharmsingGuy1701. Her heart thumped as she stared at the last message she had sent him. 9:30 pm Hey, it\\'s me. I know it\\'s really late/early where you are but we need to talk. She hadn\\'t gotten a response back from him and she was fairly certain that she didn\\'t know what she was going to say once he finally got the chance to message her. She locked her screen, tapping her phone against her mouth as she waited for the teacher. She had known that her writing buddy was an international pop star for almost as long as she knew him (I mean, it\\'s not every day you meet a movie star at a ski resort the weekend of Halloween!). But, now that she knew everything, knew of his connection to her new friend, she felt compelled to tell him that she knew who he was, who he truly was, and that she would watch after his sister while he was away on tour. So, he wouldn\\'t worry. God, she thought. That is going to be a long talk. Hey, by the way, I know the true identity that you keep from the rest of the world to protect your little sister and father from the scrutiny of the paparazzi that follows your every move in a near suffocating way. And, I know because I\\'m now friends with your little sister who I absolutely adore and she\\'s one of my close friends and... Okay, so she needed to work on it. Evelyn reached up to knock on the door again. But, as her knuckles moved to hit the door, she saw movement in the window and she withdrew her hand before Mr. Bolton swung the door open. He breathed in relief at the sight of her. \"Come on in, Evelyn,\" he spoke, ushering her inside. Evelyn stepped beside him, depositing her stuff on a desk by the door, and turned towards him. He shut the door behind him. \"Thank you for coming here.\" \"No problem,\" Evelyn replied. \"I am curious though. How did you have my phone number?\" \"I got it from Lucille\\'s phone last night,\" Mr. Bolton responded as he walked back towards his desk. His desk was on the opposite side of the room, tucked away in the corner diagonal from the door. It was also covered with graded and ungraded papers. Though, Evelyn sees that he has a system going on. She\\'s just not for sure what the system is. \"I only got it on the off chance something else happened and you needed to let me know you were taking Lucille home again.\" \"Got it,\" Evelyn replied. She had wished that she had the number yesterday to message him. But, Lucille stated that he didn\\'t look at his phone until after the school day was over. It had been useless to message him and Evelyn thought she was right. Without meaning to, she glanced at her phone. The picture of her and her own father flashed up at her. \"So, what did you want to talk to me about, Mr. Bolton?\" \"It\\'s about Lucille,\" he spoke. \"And, Evelyn, right now I\\'m just a father asking about my daughter. You don\\'t have to call me Mr. Bolton right now. Please, call me Troy.\" \"Alright,\" Evelyn spoke. \"Troy? Why do you want to talk about Lucille?\" She glanced up at him and saw the look on his face. He was looking away from her, but she spotted the expression plastered on his face. It was one of worry and hurting and all other emotions Evelyn expected a father to feel after their daughter had a panic attack in the bathroom of a school. She bit her lip and let him figure out his words. \"Is she okay?\" he finally decided. Evelyn breathed. And, spoke the truth, \"In all honesty, I don\\'t know.\" He looked up at her, giving her a look that she recognized well. She might\\'ve only been his student for two weeks, but she knew when teachers sent her the \\'explain\\' look when they didn\\'t like her blunt answer. \"I think that she\\'s still upset about the whole scenario. But, I also think watching those home movies helped her out a bit. In figuring out what she wants to do, that is.\" Troy nodded his head. He ran a hand through his hair and let out a shaky breath that she didn\\'t even realize he was holding. \"That\\'s good,\" he whispered, more to himself than to her. He was so quiet that Evelyn had to strain to hear his comment and pretended not to hear it. He was louder for his next comment which let her know that it was directed towards her. \"Has she decided on if she\\'s going to do the musical?\" Evelyn shook her head. \"No, I think she\\'s still on the fence about what she wants to do.\" She wrung her hands together. \"I think it might be beneficial for her to speak to her brother. He might be able to help her out.\" He let out a sigh. \"Yeah, I thought of that,\" he whispered. \"But, the problem is that…\" He trailed off as though he couldn\\'t finish his sentence. \"He\\'s an international pop star and is currently in France?\" Evelyn questioned, careful not to be too loud as she spoke the truth they both knew. The door to the hallway was closed and the other classrooms around them were either empty or had numerous students talking loudly to one another. However, Troy did not seem to be aware that she knew from the look that he gave her and Evelyn threw up her hands. \"She had told me about it before Ms. Darbus came over. But, I think she was going to tell me after I followed her to the bathroom but Mrs. Castillo came in before she could.\" \"Oh,\" Troy responded. \"I\\'m sorry, she didn\\'t tell me that you knew.\" \"It\\'s okay,\" Evelyn spoke. \"She\\'s been preoccupied.\" \"That\\'s true,\" Troy replied. He looked at his phone and stared at it with a confused look on his face. \"What?\" she questioned. \"Is it Lucille?\" \"No, it\\'s not anything to do with her,\" he replied. \"I just realized something…\" He glanced back up her and she raised an eyebrow. \"It\\'s just that my wife didn\\'t call me last night. She\\'s usually pretty meticulous with calling me at night.\" \"Oh,\" Evelyn replied. \"I\\'m sure it\\'s nothing.\" Troy gave her a funny look. \"You don\\'t even know my wife,\" he spoke, but there\\'s a chuckle present in his voice. Evelyn bit her lip and looked away from him. \"I mean, I kinda do? I only met her once and it was pretty brief… at a Halloween party… about a year ago…\" She nervously glanced towards him. For a minute, Troy simply looked at her and his eyebrows furrow in confusion as he\\'s trying to process what she said. And, then, she sees the drawing of a realization and there\\'s a laugh the forms in his throat. He hurried to laugh in his hand as he looked towards the papers that rested in front of him. \"Oh, that\\'s a weird twist of fate. And, I thought Gabriella transferring to my school was impossible.\" \"Huh?\" she questioned. \"Nothing,\" Troy spoke, waving his hand. \"I\\'m sure you\\'ll hear the story eventually.\" She smiled at him though she still remained confused. There\\'s a knock on the classroom door. \"Do you mind getting that for me?\" he questioned. Evelyn nodded, moving towards the door. \"I think it might be Mrs. Castillo asking about how Lucille is doing.\" She got to the door, peering out the window. She couldn\\'t see anyone standing outside of the door other than the handful of students that were walking through the hallway. But, to be safe, she opened the door slightly and swung it open. A hand darted out to grab at the edge of the door and open it the rest of the way. The woman stepped into view and Evelyn thought for a moment that the woman had stopped breathing. Evelyn knew that she had (except, not really, because if she had stopped breathing, she would be dead). The woman in front of her was almost the same height as her, with long curly brown hair spilling from a red beanie. The woman looked at Evelyn with wide blue eyes that peered at her from behind a pair of red-framed glasses. She was dressed in an East High hoodie and a pair of denim jeans. The blue-haired girl was barely taller than the woman in front of her even with the woman opposite of her in heels. If she\\'s here, then... Evelyn turned towards Troy, who gave her a look of confusion. \"I have to go,\" she spoke, suddenly. \"I\\'ll be back for my stuff before class starts.\" She tiptoed around the woman before running towards the cafeteria. 5:30 am Hey, it\\'s me. I know it\\'s really late/early where you are but we need to talk. The sight of the message on the screen gave him more anxiety than he was ever willing to admit publicly. Or, even to her. The girl on the other end of the text was the endgame. He had known it from the moment that they had met in that stupid Halloween party that he had been dragged too. He had been dressed as \"Modern Prince Charming\" which was supposed to be ironic and she was dressed up as Evie from Descendents (which was also meant to be ironic) with a bright blue wig and everything. They had spent most of the night crammed in the corner. It was the beginning of his career at Matty Nielsen and he had known enough to be wary but was naive enough to not shove her away. And, this was a girl he had genuinely felt a connection to. She loved writing about as much as he did (he dabbled with writing stories in between tutors and singing and writing songs, but his mother was always better at that). So, they exchanged i.m. names to keep in touch and he hadn\\'t seen her since. He wanted to see her and tell her everything, but he couldn\\'t do that right now. He bit his lip as he looked at the message. He quickly tried to convert the time to what it would be in France so he could figure out what the schedule would be. It would be eight hours from now so he should be resting before his final rehearsal for the France show. His phone was still stuck in the timezone of France, so his phone shouldn\\'t give him away. Alright, what\\'s up? Early morning rehearsal but I\\'ve got a couple of hours. Is everything okay? When he feels the hand on his shoulder, his thumb was hovering over the send key. His mind quickly flashes through what he\\'s going to say. He\\'s meeting up his girlfriend… no, he\\'s meeting his boyfriend (and this hypothetical boyfriend was a junior) to have a quick breakfast at the bakery that his dad talked about the last time they talked and, no, he wasn\\'t Matty Nielsen though he gets that a lot. But, as he turned and started to anticipate the comment \\'You look so much like Matty Nielsen\\', he found his heart jumping to his throat and begin to thump wildly. He blinked. \" Evie?!\" She grinned at him. For a split second, he thought that he saw a soft shade of pink ghosting across her cheeks before it was gone. \"Well, hello to you too, Clark Kent. Cute glasses.\" She pointed at the black frames that he always used when he went out in public. Now, Matty felt his face heat up as he nervously tweaked at the glasses. The girl in front of him had her bright blue hair descending in messy waves that had to have come from sleeping and not having a brush. She wore a gray sweater that went a little bit past her hips and a pair of black athletic leggings. This wasn\\'t what he expected to come from the day. \"Thanks,\" he spoke, his cheeks flushing again once he realized he was staring. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Looking for you,\" she deadpanned, shrugging her shoulders. She sent a text to someone. \"You see when your mom showed up as I was talking to your dad, I figured that you had to be somewhere nearby. So, I figured I should find you before Daniel did.\" \"You know, Daniel?\" he questioned. Suddenly, the rest of her sentence caught up to him like a freight train and he recoiled, stepping back from her. \"Wait. What do you mean?\" He looked around, but none of the tired teenagers that busied around them paid either of them any attention. They were too tired as they moved to the cafeteria. She gave him a look and took a frightening step closer. \"Not now, there\\'s too much to catch up on and I\\'m not the one who needs you right now,\" she whispered to him. \"Hold on. I gotta go find…\" he trailed off unable to figure out what he was going to say. \"Sister?\" she filled in. He nodded his head, unsure of how she knew. \"I know where she is. Come on.\" She reached out to take his hand and he felt his hand respond to hers easily. She pulled him towards where the crowd was going, a busy cafeteria, and he hurried to move into step beside her. \"We better get there soon before Daniel or his girlfriend finds us. I really don\\'t feel like being in the middle of a fight today.\" \"Wait,\" Matty stopped. His motion was counteracted by her own continuing to move, but he was stronger and she stumbled backward once their arms straightened out. She wasn\\'t expecting it and nearly fell over as a result. He hurried to catch her before she hit the white tile floor, straightening her back up, and she turned towards him. He raised an eyebrow as he spoke, \"Daniel\\'s girlfriend?\" \"Yeah,\" she sounded like she didn\\'t like the prospect of it either. \"His girlfriend.\" Matty blinked at her and whispered, \"But, he doesn\\'t even like girls.\" She threw her hands up in the air (and the one that held his brought his own hand along as well). \"Trust me, I know, I know, I keep telling him that hiding it would only make it worse, but you know what he tells me? You don\\'t understand, Evelyn.\" Matty chuckled at her impression. \"But, whenever I ask so I can understand, he doesn\\'t tell me and just marches off into the distance before I can ask what he… Wait… how do you know?\" Matty raised an eyebrow at her. \"How exactly did you think he found out?\" The look on her face was priceless. Her mouth dropped, but she was half grinning, half looking like everything made sense all in one go. Matty could see the puzzle pieces clicking together in her mind as she looked up at him. Suddenly, she hit his shoulder. \"Oh my god,\" she whispered. \"That changes everything that I thought I knew. I always thought it was Shelby that made him think…\" She blinked. \"Wait, did you two date?\" Matty scoffed at her. \"No, actually, it was more of an experimental thing for both of us. We talked about it afterward. We told our parents… no, actually, I told my parents and informed them that I didn\\'t think I was as straight as I thought I was… I don\\'t remember if Daniel actually told his parents about the whole thing though.\" Her eyebrows furrowed. \"How come I never heard about this?\" Matty glanced down at her. It was a difficult question to answer. And, she was upset. He could tell. He wasn\\'t surprised. He had been the one to talk with her about her own discovery of her identity. But, before he could even open his mouth to respond, she shook her head, \"Nevermind, we can talk later. We gotta hurry.\" And, with that, she was tugging him back the way they had originally going. Troy was about halfway out of his chair to follow Evelyn when the woman stepped into the classroom and shut the door behind her. Troy looked at her with a confused look before realization struck a heartbeat later. He breathed in relief and his wife looked up at him. His wife smiled at him before crossing the room and wrapping her arms around his waist. He gripped at her shoulders. He buried his face in the flesh of her shoulder and exhaled a shaky breath. He wasn\\'t going to lie. He felt better already. \"What are you doing here, Kelsi?\" he spoke. She chuckled. \"Danny called Matty yesterday after Lucille had a panic attack.\" Troy pulled away, running a hand through his hair. She looked up at him with a worried look in her eyes but a small grin on her face as she gazed at him. \"I was going to tell you when you called me last night. I didn\\'t even find out myself until after school ended and I talked with Sharpay and…\" he trailed off and let out a groan. \"I\\'m going to kill him at practice this afternoon.\" \"Don\\'t kill Danny,\" she lightly ordered. \"Matty wanted to see Lucille and I knew you were in school so I didn\\'t tell you. Then, we were on the plane and… yeah, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t tell you that we were coming, but I figured it would be a pretty good surprise.\" \"It\\'s okay and it is,\" Troy spoke. \"Who was that girl, by the way?\" Kelsi questioned, lacing their fingers together. \"Evelyn,\" Troy replied. His phone went off on his desk and he moved to grab it. Kelsi insisted on keeping their hands linked and followed him over to his desk. \"She\\'s a friend of Lucille. She helped her with her panic attack yesterday and then took her home. She\\'s also, apparently, a friend of Matty\\'s which is a random coincidence that I find incredibly funny.\" He reached over picking up the phone. 7:32 am I\\'m with Matty. Kelsi shrugged her shoulders as he sat back down at his desk and surveyed the paper explosion in front of him. \"The universe works in funny ways.\" She gave him a look, one he knew incredibly well. It was the look that she always gave him when she knew something was wrong with him. She had sent it to his way on numerous times. The first one that he could physically remember was after Gabriella had gone to California and he was forced to dance with Sharpay in the musical. She tilted her head to the side as she placed her free hand on his shoulder. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Better now,\" he admitted, reaching up to grab the hand on his shoulder. \"But, I\\'m worried.\" \"I can tell,\" his wife admitted with a sigh. He glanced up at her and she nodded towards his desk. \"Your desk is a mess . Do you even have anything organized?\" He chuckled. \"Not anymore. I did for a bit, but there was a lot of things that got turned in yesterday. I may have to stay after tomorrow to get everything organized again.\" \"Well, you\\'ve been a bit preoccupied. You know you don\\'t have to be strong all the time, you know?\" \"God,\" he spoke, the laugh returning to his voice once again. \"Did you talk to Mom before you came here because she said the exact same thing to me yesterday.\" She shook her head and leaned against his desk. His hand was in between hers with her thumb rubbing soothing circles on the back of his hand. He gripped her hand tighter as though she might disappear into the air. She might when classes started, he thought. But, not right now. \"I just…\" he trailed off. She didn\\'t move to fill in the sentence even though they both knew that she could. \"I just want to help her.\" \"I know,\" she whispered. Troy glanced at her, knowing that she had the same need to understand what was going on in their daughter\\'s head. \"But, Lucille doesn\\'t want to tell us what happened. And, we\\'ve always agreed to never invade our children\\'s privacy so we could always have their confidence when it came to important matters.\" She paused, reaching up to touch Troy\\'s face. \"We need to believe in our son to help her through this.\" Troy nodded his head. \"I know and I do believe in him to help her,\" he whispered. \"I just wish that there was something that I can do to help her.\" His wife smiled at him, one of those smiles that make him slip into a daze for just a moment. \"Just continue being her dad, her lovely and wonderful and overprotective father,\" she muttered, pushing back a strand of his hair from his forehead. \"That\\'s enough for her. And, I know that you know that so don\\'t you dare deny it. We don\\'t know what\\'s going on with her and how much it\\'s affecting her, but she knows that we\\'ll be here for her whenever she needs us to be.\" \"I know,\" he replied. He squeezed her hand in response. \"I just-\" In a particularly bold move for Kelsi (even as his wife), she dipped down to cut him off with a kiss. Troy squeezed her hand harder and felt her hand grip his in response. She pulled back from him and he looked up towards her. \"We\\'ve never needed words before, Troy. Now, isn\\'t any different.\" Troy nodded his head, reaching up to brace the back of her head and pull her back to him for another kiss. Both her hands were on either side of his face and his hand that she held drop to her knee. But, he feels the need to say it when she pulls away. \"I just wish you were home,\" he breathed. \"I wish I was home too,\" is her response. \"Evelyn.\" It was Shelby. \"I\\'ll be there in a couple of minutes,\" Evelyn pushed Matty up the stairs. The boy gave her a weird look before going up the rest of the way. He went out onto the roof and the door slammed shut behind him and Evelyn watched him go before pivoting towards Shelby, who sent a curious glance at the boy who disappeared. \"What is it, Shelby?\" she questioned. Shelby was dressed with her black curls in a tight ponytail on the back of her head. The girl wore a fashionable white tanktop which contrasted nicely with her skin and a beige crocheted sweater around her shoulder. She also wore a pair of blue skinny jeans tucked into a pair of boots. Evelyn gulped, biting at her lips as the head cheerleader appraised her. She coughed and Shelby adverted her gaze. \"Who was that?\" she questioned, nodding towards the roof entrance. \"A friend,\" she replied, instantaneously. \"A friend?\" Shelby questioned. \"Like a boyfriend?\" Evelyn let out an involuntarily sigh. \"If you mean a boy who is also a friend, then yes he is. What do you want to talk about?\" \"Preferably, I don\\'t want to talk at-,\" Shelby spoke before halting herself mid-sentence. Evelyn glanced up at her. The remark must\\'ve been an instinct because the girl bit down on her lip and sheepishly looked away from the blue-haired girl. Evelyn watched as Shelby looked around the empty hallway. She was afraid that someone would overhear. Evelyn knew. She had been there. Then, suddenly, Shelby was taking her hand and dragging her further down the hallway. Shelby found an empty room that was open and tugged her inside. Evelyn stumbled into one of the desks in the Garden Club\\'s normal hangout. But, she quickly straightened herself as Shelby locked the door so they wouldn\\'t be disturbed. The room was empty and they were alone. \"I don\\'t want to talk at all,\" she repeated. Evelyn gave the girl opposite her a look. \"You already know that\\'s not an option. Not with me.\" Shelby shrugged her shoulders. \"I know.\" \"Then, why do you keep asking?\" \"Because I really like you,\" Shelby confessed. Evelyn bit her lip again. \"And, I know you like me too.\" And, there it was. Evelyn did like Shelby. She always had from the moment that Evelyn had finally come to terms with her own sexuality. But, because there was always one of those in situations like this, Evelyn didn\\'t like the fact that both Shelby and Daniel were masquerading their relationship around the school to hide their sexualities. She had to give it to them. Not very many people would have the guts to kiss someone on the mouth (and fake jealousy) to hide the fact that they weren\\'t actually in a relationship. But, Shelby did. She wished that liking someone of the same gender was considered normal. Shelby was only out to a select few people. Daniel and Evelyn. That was it. There were a handful of reasons that Shelby could\\'ve been keeping that part of her a secret. But, one of them was definitely that she was afraid that colleges would withhold scholarships because she liked girls instead of boys. Another was that she didn\\'t want the other cheerleaders to feel uncomfortable when she was around. Evelyn had told her numerous times that her sexuality should not be a problem for the other cheerleaders. Most of them had been raised in an environment and a time where it simply didn\\'t matter anymore. But, even so, Evelyn understood her reason for being quiet. \"I do like you,\" Evelyn told her. \"But, I also want to have a public relationship where I don\\'t have to skirt around in the shadows and I can kiss you in public without having to watch you kiss your supposed boyfriend to keep up an act that the two of you want to keep. I understand the need to keep it a secret for fear of scrutiny and I understand why you are doing it, but that doesn\\'t mean I can\\'t be unhappy about it.\" \"I can\\'t give you that,\" Shelby spoke. \"I know,\" Evelyn replied. \"But, you are the one who can\\'t seem to live with that response.\" \"Maybe there\\'s a part of me that wants it to change.\" \"It\\'s not going to.\" \"I know.\" (A/N) Caution: This upcoming scene has some vague references for what happened to Lucille prior to the story. Because of nature, I caution everyone to be careful when reading this scene. If you don\\'t feel comfortable reading this scene, do not read it. I will put an author\\'s note at the end of the section if you want to skip past to that. Hey, you.\" Lucille thought she was hearing things. She had to be hearing things. Or she was losing her mind (and the jury was out with that one). Because, that was the voice of her twin brother, Matthew Jack, and he was in France at the current moment and wasn\\'t set to be home for another few months of his world tour. But, she turned away from the view of the suburbs of Albuquerque, New Mexico to find said twin walking over to her on the rooftop of her high school. He was dressed in a pair of worn denim jeans and a plain but bright red t-shirt. He had a thin jacket on his shoulders and the zipper was open. He had on a pair of black frame glasses (which he actually didn\\'t need) perched on his nose. And, there was a maroon beanie fitted over his head with his brown locks poked from beneath the cloth. His hands were dug into the pockets of his jeans and he smiled sheepishly at her. She was always in awe of how he always managed to look so natural and casual in anything he was in. It was unfair. \"Matty?\" she questioned. \"Hey,\" he spoke. Lucille gave him a look and scrambled to her feet, quickly closing the distance and throwing her arms around her twin\\'s neck. His arms wrapped tightly around her, bringing her close against him. She pulled back from him, keeping him at arm\\'s length. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" \"At school or in Albuquerque?\" he questioned. \"Both!\" she snapped. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" He laughed. \"I was worried about you.\" He took her hand and dragged her over to the greenhouse. He sat down on the ground and she moved to join him. She turned to face him as he propped himself against the greenhouse. \"Danny called,\" he informed her. Lucille rolled her eyes and looked away from him. Of course, he did . \"And, I was worried about you so I managed to convince Mom to let me come see you for a bit.\" \"You managed to convince Mom to let you fly from France to New Mexico?\" Lucille questioned. \"Well, once she heard it was because you were signed up to audition for the musical, she was pretty worried about you too,\" Matty replied. \"And, so we both got on a plane and headed this way. We\\'re leaving after dinner tonight and we\\'ll be pretty close and I\\'ll be knocked out on sleeping medication to try and combat the jet lag. But, we\\'ll be able to make it in time for the final day of rehearsals.\" \"That\\'s good,\" Lucille spoke. \"How did you find me?\" \"Evie,\" he responded. She furrowed her eyebrows. \"How does she know you?\" \"Quit trying to stall the conversation, Lucky,\" he spoke, softly. He turned towards her and she looked over at him and the all-knowing look in his eye. He knew. He knew what she was thinking. Evelyn had tried to hit the mark, but she didn\\'t have all the information. But, Matty knew. She had begged him not to tell and he hadn\\'t and he wouldn\\'t not until she told him to because \\'that was her secret to tell\\'. He gave her a look and she avoided his gaze. \"I don\\'t want to talk about it,\" she responded. \"I know you don\\'t want to talk about it and trust me when I say that I don\\'t really want to talk about it either because it hurts you,\" he replied. He reached out to take her hand and she looked up at him. \"But, we need to talk about it if you\\'re going to get better. Dad\\'s worried about you. Mom\\'s worried about you. So are Nana and Grandpa. I\\'m worried about you.\" \"I know, I know you are all worried about…\" \"You need to hear this.\" Her brother reached out to grip her shoulders and force her to keep looking at him when she desperately wanted to look away. His gaze was intense and protective. \"Whatever it is that\\'s holding you back from doing something that I know you still love, it stems from him . And he isn\\'t here. He isn\\'t near you anymore. He cannot harm you anymore. He cannot touch you anymore. I promise you I won\\'t let him have the opportunity to do that to you again.\" \"I know,\" she whispered. \"No,\" he responded. She moved to rebuff him and he held up his hand to stop her. \"You don\\'t. He was trying to alienate you and separate you from anyone and everything you loved so he could have you completely under his control and you fought his control and he got angry with you and he did what he did and then he won, Lucille. He\\'s winning because you are doing exactly what he wanted you to do. You dropped out of drama and you stopped singing and you stopped being happy.\" He paused and gripped tightly on his knee. He was breathing heavy as though talking so much was worse than singing and talking for almost a straight couple of hours with only five minutes breaks. She moved to speak and tell him that he didn\\'t have to say it and it probably was going to be involved with some sort of joke at her own expense. But, he knew that and cut her off before she was fully aware that she opened her mouth. \"And, I don\\'t care how many times it takes me telling you because I\\'m going to tell you every time and it\\'s never going to be annoying for me to say it. Because it serves a person and it helps you and I will say it over and over and over again until you stop believing the lies that he has managed to get into your head.\" \"Matty,\" she spoke, reaching up to rub her eyes. \"You don\\'t have to-\" \"I\\'m never going to stop telling you that you\\'re beautiful, Lucille. You look like the spitting image of Mom with Dad\\'s jawline. And, it\\'s incredibly unfair to everyone else in the universe because we come from two of the most attractive people of their graduating class. Though, I might be biased. I\\'m never going to stop telling you that I wish you were onstage beside me or backstage every time I start a concert or a new set. I want you there with me and I want to be here with you. And, I\\'m never going to stop telling you that you are twice the singer that I am and that I have always tried to be as good as you are when you sing because you sing with every fiber of your being and it is incredible to watch.\" He reached up to wipe away the tears on her cheeks and she flinched, looking up to see that he had tears rolling down his cheeks too. \"Our father spent half of his high school career torn between basketball (in which he won two state championships) and theater. Our mother is a world famous director, composer, and has been composing since she\\'s been able to pick up a pencil. They taught us to always do what makes us happy. And, what you are doing right now isn\\'t making you happy,\" he whispered. \"Is it?\" Lucille inhaled a shaky breath. And, she shook her head, wiping the tears from her eyes. Her brother reached up and raised her head so she\\'d look at him. \"If you decide what I hope you decide and you ever need to hear that again, call me. I don\\'t care if I\\'m on stage in front of millions. I will call you back and I\\'ll tell you this all over again. Because you need to hear it and I\\'m more than willing to tell you it all over again if I have to. Hell, I\\'ll even record it and send it to you so that way you can hear it whenever you need to.\" He paused and Lucille was certain that she heard her heart thumping in her chest as her brain poured over his words. \"Do you believe me?\" She blinked. \"Yes,\" she whispered. (A/N) End Scene. When the door to Sharpay\\'s room opens up after school, she assumed that it would simply be Troy once again, this time trying his damnedest to get Sharpay to change her mind about having Lucille be the one to talk to him. And, so as such, she told him without looking up, \"Troy, if you are here to talk about getting Lucille out of the musical, I\\'ve already told you my terms.\" Except, it wasn\\'t Troy. \"I know, Mrs. Leverett,\" Lucille spoke. Sharpay glanced up to find the brunette standing at the door. She was nervous, picking at her fingernails, as she stepped further into the room. \"I wanted to talk to you about that actually…\" \"About not doing the musical?\" Sharpay questioned, pushing herself to her feet. She walked around her desk and took the stairs off the stage. She had already fallen over once today. She did not want to take the chance of that happening again. The brunette looked up to the teacher as she approached. For a moment, she\\'s quiet and then, she whispers, \"I don\\'t know…\" And, Sharpay never thought that she\\'d ever witness the pain that Ryan felt all those years ago in her eyes. But, she did in Lucille\\'s eyes for a fraction of a moment and her blue eyes looked over at the desks and it was gone, just like that. Lucille spoke out a weak, \"There\\'s a part of me that wants to do the musical audition and there\\'s another part of me that thinks that the musical is in the past.\" She buried her face in her hands. \"It\\'s all very confusing, I shouldn\\'t have come.\" She moved to leave and flee the classroom and Sharpay instinctively reached out to grab her arm. I\\'m not making that mistake again , she thought to herself. Lucille stopped. \"Don\\'t leave,\" Sharpay spoke. \"It\\'s not that confusing at all.\" Lucille turned towards her. \"It isn\\'t?\" she replied, her voice tiny. \"No,\" Sharpay replied, sitting down at the edge of the small makeshift stage. \"It\\'s not. Come on, sit with me, and we can talk about it so it might not be as confusing anymore to you. Okay?\" Lucille looked at her then nodded her head. She placed her bag at the feet of one of the desks and then sat down beside Sharpay. She gripped onto her fingers and looked at them instead of up at her. \"Why do you feel like being in the musical is in the past?\" Lucille bit her lip. \"I don\\'t know…\" she trailed off. \"Did someone tell you that?\" Sharpay questioned. For a moment, the girl stayed quiet and she glanced up at Sharpay through her eyelashes, giving her a wary look as though she was trying to figure out what she could tell the blonde teacher. Then, finally, she pulled her eyes away from Sharpay and avoided her gaze as she spoke, softly, \"Yes.\" Sharpay nodded her head and kept her hands on her knees though she desperately wanted to wrap her arms around the girl beside her and tell her what she should\\'ve told Ryan. But, she couldn\\'t. So, instead, Sharpay looked at her. \"Your dad came and talked to me yesterday,\" she admitted. \"He\\'s really worried about you.\" \"I know,\" Lucille replied. Sharpay nodded. \"After he left to go back to practice, I spent the better part of the next couple of hours looking over your file and I must say, I am impressed by the number of years you\\'ve spent in some sort of dramatic setting. I talked to your old drama teacher and he sent over some videos. I was thinking maybe something happened and you had some form of stage fright because of something that happened on stage, but I watched the videos and you were brilliant. And, I talked to him again and he wanted me to tell you that he hopes you get back on the stage again because you lived on that stage.\" Lucille let out something that resembled a cross between a laugh and a cry. \"He\\'s over exaggerating.\" \"If you are anything like your father was in high school, he\\'s not exaggerating one bit,\" Sharpay responded and Lucille gave her a weak glance in response. \"And, I\\'m not going to tell you what to do. But, I would love to have you on that stage. I would love to have every student on stage. And, if you want to reevaluate that old part of you, then I am all for giving you the chance and opportunity to do so.\" Lucille bit her lip. \"Did he tell you that you were a bad singer?\" \"Who?\" Lucille questioned, raising an eyebrow. \"The boy who put you in the hospital,\" Sharpay spoke. Lucille looked at her, a look of surprise and shock on her face. And, then, Lucille guarded her expression and looked away again. But, she answered, and it was so soft that she had to strain to hear it, \"Yes.\" \"He was lying,\" Sharpay stated, matter-of-factly. \"He was lying and I can tell you that because I heard you singing with Phillip in that music room and you have a beautiful voice. You are a beautiful singer.\" Lucille stayed quiet. \"If I end up doing the audition,\" she started before trailing off. Sharpay watched as she gathered her courage, watched as the multiple different scenarios flashed across her blue eyes, and watched the steel-determination returned in her face that she had only seen once before. And, it almost brought a smile to Sharpay\\'s face. \"Are you going to tell me when I am doing something wrong?\" \"Yes,\" Sharpay spoke. \"I will tell you if you are doing something wrong and I will tell you how to do a scene better. But, I will also tell you most of the time when you ask me I\\'m going to tell you that the only thing you are doing wrong is doubting yourself.\" Lucille nodded her head. \"And, if you decide, come to me and I can talk to you about what it is that we need to do to make you feel comfortable. I don\\'t want to put you in a situation that you don\\'t want to be in. If you decide that you don\\'t feel comfortable, come to me and we\\'ll talk about it. If I can\\'t keep you comfortable, then you can leave and I won\\'t stop you.\" Lucille nodded her head. \"Lucille,\" Sharpay spoke to her. The brunette looked up at her. \"I can tell that this is not an easy decision for you to make. But, I promise that I\\'m not going to force you to audition for the musical.\" Lucille is quiet. \"So, take all the time that you need. Talk to your dad. Talk to Evelyn. But, think it over, because I want you in the musical if that\\'s what you want to do.\" Lucille nodded. \"Yes, Mrs. Leverett,\" she spoke, bringing her bag to her with her foot. Lucille moved towards the door before stopping. She turned back to Sharpay, who looked at her questionably. \"Have you heard from Phillip about if he\\'s going to do the musical?\" Sharpay shook her head. \"But, I\\'m hoping that he will,\" she replied. \"He\\'s always been so stressed with thinking about scholarships for school. And, when he sang with you, I didn\\'t see that. I just hope I didn\\'t cause him more grief as I accidentally caused you.\" \"You had no way of knowing,\" Lucille responded. \"One more thing,\" Sharpay spoke. Lucille turned towards her, a look back in her eyes that reminds Sharpay so much of the girl\\'s own mother. But, she doesn\\'t voice the comparison as she gave Lucille a reassuring smile and whispered, \"Don\\'t let him win, Lucille.\" A grin crept up on the girl\\'s face, a grin that was involuntarily, and she wondered what ran through the girl\\'s head at that moment. \"I\\'ll try not to,\" she replied before she left, the door closing behind her. Sharpay watched her go and bit her lip as she thought of the confident composer that Sharpay used to manipulate. It wasn\\'t her proudest moment and she had long since changed since the girl who had done those things. And, she thought to herself, she hoped that she might be able to do better by her daughter. \"Come on, Jack,\" Alyson told him. Jack Bolton eyed the wheelchair with a disgruntled gaze as the woman beside him had pushed it between the car door and the body of the car. The blonde woman gave him a look as Jack reached across with his good arm to unbuckle himself. He had done it a few times, getting himself into a wheelchair with only one hand and minimal help. It wasn\\'t easy. But, he could do it. \"Troy and Lucille and the Danforths are inside with dinner,\" she attempted to coax. \"And, it\\'s your favorite.\" Jack glared at her. Then, he reached out to pull himself out of the car and into the seat. It took a bit of help from Alyson as she pulled him into the seat. Jack let out a huff as he maneuvered himself back further into the wheelchair. The cast on his leg was difficult to angle out of the car. But, Alyson backed up the wheelchair and was able to help him with that. The door to the passenger side closed with the wind and Alyson pushed the wheelchair up the driveway. \"Thank you for not rolling me into the street,\" he remarked as she turned the wheelchair onto the sidewalk. \"You\\'re welcome.\" Alyson rolled him down the sidewalk and towards the front door of the house. At some point, she managed to shift him around so she was dragging him backward. He stared at the street and thought about how much he wanted to get up and walk. But, with a cast on his leg, he was relatively pinned on how much he could move on his own until the doctor made the decision to take it off. Plus, with a nurse coming in while Troy and Lucille were at school, Jack felt like it would be a while before he had the ability to gain control of his own autonomy. Jack reached out to open the door (it was unlocked) and she pushed him inside the house. \"Coach Bolton!\" it was Daniel who spotted him first, dropping a plate on the table before running over to him. The oldest Danforth son (his adopted and technically his oldest grandchild) dropped down to pull him into a hug. The boy hadn\\'t gotten the chance to visit the hospital while Jack had been working. But, he didn\\'t mind because he knew the boy was working towards the game. Behind him, his younger brother Elijah stood with a broad grin on his face. Elijah Danforth was a freshman and in the high school band. He was the only freshman to make the drumline. His curly black hair was long enough to be pulled into a small ponytail, but there were numerous strands that were falling on either side of his face. There were a set of drumsticks sticking out of his back pocket and Jack was always reminded of Chad, who had always gone from class to class with only a basketball for the majority of his high school career. \"How\\'s the team looking, Daniel?\" Jack questioned the boy. \"It\\'s going well. Uncle Troy has us building trust with each other to better serve us at the Championship Game. We\\'ve also played a few scrimmages against West High and the JV team,\" Daniel replied. \"That\\'s good,\" Jack replied, a few moments before Elijah crossed the space and bent down to hug him as well. Daniel moved to hug Alyson, who had stepped further into the house. The door shut somewhere behind him as Elijah stepped behind the wheelchair and pushed him further into the house. Salem ran off and up the stairs at the sight of the wheelchair that could\\'ve easily knocked his tail. Daniel jogged off towards the kitchen. Jack heard him open the back door and shout to the backyard. Moments later, there was shuffling from the kitchen and Jack heard Alyson gasp. \"Kelsi?\" she spoke. Jack glanced up and beamed at the sight of his daughter-in-law practically running into her adopted mother\\'s arms. Alyson held her daughter tightly as Kelsi gripped back nearly as tight. \"What are you doing here?\" the blonde woman asked. Kelsi pulled back, keeping her mother in her arms as the blonde woman took in the sight of her curly brown hair and a sheepish grin. \"Matty and I thought we would surprise everyone,\" she remarked with a wide grin. \"He\\'s out in the backyard with Chad, but they should be in any minute. They\\'re finishing up a game of basketball.\" Alyson let out a bright grin and let her daughter go, only for Kelsi to wrap her arms around Jack\\'s neck and bend down to kiss his cheek. Jack reached up with his good hand to pat her head and take the beanie off her head. His daughter-in-law reached out to take it back and succeeded. She looked around. \"Where\\'s Lucille?\" \"I think she went upstairs to get some homework done,\" Elijah remarked. Kelsi nodded her head. \"I\\'m going to go get her.\" Jack nodded his head as Kelsi rolled him up to the open end of the dining table. Then, Kelsi headed up the stairs. It didn\\'t take the director/composer too long to find her daughter\\'s room. One of the things that tipped her off was that Salem, the black cat they\\'ve had for three years, was sitting outside of the room and peering inside. Plus, it was the old guest bedroom that had been converted to her room after the twins were too old to share the same room. Salem blinked up at her as she bent down to scratch at his head. Then, Kelsi opened the door to find her daughter on the bed with a scrapbook open on the bed in front of her. She didn\\'t glance up as the door creaked open and simply flipped the page. \"Dinner is ready,\" she remarked. Lucille simply nodded her head, flipping the page of the scrapbook again as the woman stepped closer to her daughter. Kelsi sat on the edge of the bed and her daughter is quiet for a moment, for a couple heartbeats, before she\\'s opening her mouth and asking Kelsi, \"Do you think I should do it?\" \"I think you should do it if that\\'s what you want to be doing,\" Kelsi responded. Lucille let out a shaky sigh as though that wasn\\'t the information that she wanted to hear. She reached out to touch her daughter\\'s hand and her fingers curled to take her mother\\'s fingers in her own. \"What is it?\" she questioned. A smile formed on her lips but only briefly before it quickly faded. \"I just wish that someone would just say you need to do this. It\\'s so hard trying to figure out if it\\'s something that I actually want to do or if it\\'s something that I\\'m just too afraid to do.\" \"I know,\" Kelsi remarked. \"But, being in drama productions was something that you always wanted to do whenever you were going to the drama school and even after you transferred to public schools. You just knew that there was something else that you wanted to do outside of being in the productions.\" Lucille smiled softly. \"I don\\'t think I want to be a doctor anymore, Mom,\" she replied. \"That\\'s okay,\" Kelsi replied. \"It doesn\\'t matter what you end up doing. I\\'ll always be proud of you.\" \"Thanks, Mom,\" Lucille responded, her voice quiet. \"If I end up doing the musical… will you come to watch me in it?\" Kelsi nodded her head, taking her daughter\\'s other hand in her own and placing a kiss against the knuckles of her hand. \"Even if I had to reveal the secret of our little family to the world, I would make sure that both Matty and I are there to cheer for you from the back row on every night that you perform.\" Kelsi spotted the tears begin to form in her daughter\\'s eye as she looked away. \"You know that, don\\'t you?\" Lucille nodded her head. \"Yeah, Mom,\" she whispered, \"I know that.\" \"Does that help you make your decision?\" Kelsi questioned. \"I think so…\" she trailed off. \"But, I still don\\'t know for sure…\" \"It\\'s okay,\" Kelsi responded. \"I\\'ve told you the story of how your father and I first started working together on the musical. You know how frightened I was when I finally started having real feelings for your father years later. And, it\\'s going to be scary. But, your father, brother, and I will be there to catch you. I promise.\" \"And Evelyn,\" Lucille responded. \"Yes,\" Kelsi added with a grin on her face. \"And, Evelyn. I\\'m glad you\\'ve made a friend who cares so much about you and what you want to do.\" \"Me too,\" Lucille responded. There\\'s a knock and the mother and daughter turned to find Taylor McKessie-Danforth standing in the doorway with Salem rubbing against her bare feet. The Governor of New Mexico stepped into the room and had a bright grin on her face that lit up her features. Her black hair fell to her shoulders in thick curls and she wore a pencil skirt and a red button up. \"Come on, you two, it\\'s time for dinner.\" \"Yes, Aunt Taylor,\" Lucille responded, moving to stand up. \"And, I\\'ll make sure that Chad and I are there too. If you decide to do the musical, that is,\" Taylor responded. Lucille nodded her head. \"Thank you, Aunt Taylor.\" The woman grinned stepping forward to press a kiss against Lucille\\'s cheeks before leaving the room. Kelsi stood up, wrapping an arm around her daughter\\'s shoulders and walking out of the room as Lucille wrapped an arm around her mother\\'s waist. At the base of the stairs, her father was looking at a text message with a confused expression on his face. \"Dad,\" Lucille questioned. \"What\\'s wrong?\" \"It\\'s Gabriella… uh, Mrs. Castillo,\" he added upon seeing that Lucille had been the one to speak. Kelsi blinked, confused. She had known that Gabriella was now a teacher at East High and had a son who was the same age as Lucille, but she didn\\'t know why she was texting Troy. \"Is something wrong?\" Kelsi questioned. Troy glanced up at her. \"She\\'s just asking me if I could talk to Phillip about the musical tomorrow at some point,\" he informed the two of them. Lucille nodded her head and moved into the dining room. Kelsi glanced at her husband as he moved to another conversation. He angled his phone so Kelsi could read over his shoulder and she peered down at the message. It was from Sharpay, she realized upon glancing at the name. 6:00 pm. Lucille came by my classroom today after school. 6:02 pm. And? What did she say? 6:09 pm. She didn\\'t give me a flat out no. But, she didn\\'t give me a yes either. 6:15 pm. Oh, she might be starting to lean towards doing the musical. I hope she does it. 6:17 pm. How\\'s Ryan? 6:20 pm. Just trying to make him comfortable. I\\'m trying to remain optimistic for the kids\\' sakes. But, I don\\'t know how much longer he\\'s going to last. He\\'s been in a coma for almost six months now. 6:21 pm. Don\\'t be discouraged. He can easily wake up. 6:22 pm. I hope so. There\\'s so much that I want to make up for and I don\\'t want Daisy to have permanently lost both of her dads. 6:24 pm. I understand. Let me know if there\\'s anything that I can do. Alright, there we are. I hope you guys have enjoyed the chapter! If you want to tell me how I did, please leave a review or a favorite or a follow! If you want to talk to me one-on-one, you can always send me a private message. I hope to see you guys next time for Chapter Seven where we see Phillip\\'s side of things.']","Summary":" ['Another High School Musical … ACT ONE: JUNIOR YEAR … Chapter One: New Lucille Bolton had lived in"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"La Decisión","Author":"DragonTribute","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13211900","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['¡Hola!, con la novedad de que en Netflix publicaron las dos primeras entregas de High School Musical, me entró la curiosidad de saber si existían Fanfics de estas películas. Mi sorpresa fue que, increíblemente, sí los hay. Encontré una trilogía escrita por Zanessalover576, que se llaman \"The Choice\", \"The Consequenses\" y \"The Life\", que se traducirían a: \"La Decisión\", \"Las Consecuencias\" y \"La Vida\" respectivamente. Mis notas estarán en cursiva . Disfruten el inicio de esta trilogía. Troy abrió la puerta y entró a la casa después de salir de la escuela. Subió las escaleras y se encerró en su cuarto. Troy se acostó en la cama y suspiró. Iba a ser padre a los diecisiete. Gabriella lloró cuando le dijo. Él arruinó sus vidas y la posibilidad de que Gabriella fuera a Stanford, la escuela de sus sueños. Las lágrimas bajaron por la cara de Troy cuando pensó en la reacción de Gabriella cuando se enteró. Fue sacado de sus pensamientos cuando alguien tocó la puerta de su cuarto. —Troy, ¿salimos a jugar? Tenemos que hacer un plan de juego —dijo Jack. —No estoy de humor —dijo Troy, dando la vuelta. —¿Pasó algo malo? —preguntó Jack. —Tengo que esperar hasta que mamá llegue para contarles —dijo Troy. —¿Reprobaste alguna ma…? —comenzó Jack. —¡Papá!, espera hasta que mamá llegue —dijo Troy, firmemente. —Está bien —dijo Jack. Una hora después, Lucille Bolton entró por la puerta y vio a Troy sentado en la sala con los ojos cerrados. —Troy, ¿estás bien? —preguntó Lucille. —Tengo que hablar contigo y con papá —dijo Troy, nervioso. —Bueno, déjame ir por él —dijo Lucille. Lucille salió del cuarto para ir por su esposo. Troy tomó un respiro profundo y soltó el aire. Lucille y Jack entraron al cuarto y se sentaron en el sofá enfrente de su hijo. —¿Qué está pasando, Troy? —preguntó Lucille. —Tengo que decirles algo, pero no sé si tengo suficientes palabras para hacerlo —comenzó Troy. —Cariño, lo que sea que te esté molestando, sabes que siempre podrás hablar con nosotros —dijo Lucille. Troy soltó el aire que estaba aguantando. —Gabriella… —comenzó Troy, pero no pudo terminar. —¿Qué pasa con Gabi? —preguntó Lucille. —Gabriella está embarazada —dijo Troy. —¿Es tuyo? —preguntó Jack, tratando de contener el enojo. —Sí —dijo Troy. —Troy —dijo Lucille tranquilamente. Jack se levantó y salió del cuarto y fue a la habitación principal y azotó la puerta. —Sé que es mi culpa. Apoyaré a Gabriella y al bebé. Conseguiré un trabajo —comenzó Troy. —Creo que tu papá necesita algo de tiempo para pensar —dijo Lucille. —No quiero que me odien —dijo Troy. —Nunca podríamos odiarte Troy. Estamos decepcionados por las decisiones que hiciste —dijo Lucille. Troy asintió. —Y sé que estás asustado y te mereces que lo estés. Pero eso no significa que no nos preocupemos por ti —dijo Lucille. Troy asintió. —Iré a ver a Gabriella. Le está diciendo a sus padres en este momento también —dijo Troy. Lucille asintió. —Lo siento, mamá —dijo Troy. —No te disculpes conmigo. Discúlpate con Gabriella y contigo. Dile a María que le llamaré después —dijo Lucille. Troy asintió y salió de la casa. Condujo a la casa de Gabriella y estacionó su auto. Troy tomó un profundo respiro y soltó el aire. Salió del auto y caminó hasta esa puerta que conocía tan bien. Troy tocó el timbre y María abrió la puerta. —Troy —dijo María, con lágrimas en el rostro. Troy no lo soportó y también soltó lágrimas. —Lo siento mamá. Lo siento mucho —chilló Troy. María abrió sus brazos y Troy caminó hacia ellos. Troy se disculpó repetidas veces y María frotó la espalda de su \"hijo\". —¿Dónde está mi chica? —preguntó Troy, mientras se secaba las lágrimas. —Está en su cuarto —dijo María. —¿Cómo está? —preguntó Troy. —Está llorando. Troy, no se librarán de esto tan fácil. Tendrán que encargarse de esto —dijo María. —Y planeo hacerlo —dijo Troy. —Bien. Así estaremos claros —dijo María. —¿Puedo ir a verla? —preguntó Troy, cuidadosamente. María asintió. —Adelante —dijo María. Troy entró a la casa y subió las escaleras hasta el cuarto de Gabriella. La puerta estaba cerrada y podía escuchar a Gabriella llorando incontrolablemente. Troy pensó que era mejor si tocaba la puerta en lugar de solo entrar al cuarto. Tocó la puerta suavemente. Troy pudo escuchar a Gabriella acercándose a la puerta. —Mami, no quiero hablar —chilló Gabriella. —Bebé, soy yo —dijo Troy. —¿Troy? —preguntó Gabriella. —Sí amor. Aquí estoy. ¿Puedo pasar? —preguntó Troy. —¿Está mamá contigo? —preguntó Gabriella. —No, solo estoy yo —dijo Troy. Gabriella abrió la puerta lentamente y vio a Troy de pie frente a la puerta. Corrió a los brazos de su novio y lloró. Troy besó suavemente la cabeza de Gabriella. Cerró la puerta del cuarto de Gabriella con el pie y caminó con ella en sus brazos hasta su cama y la sentó. —Tenemos que hablar sobre esto —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Lo siento mucho Troy. Tu beca… —comenzó Gabriella. —Hey, no hablemos de eso ahora. Tenemos que hablar de qué vamos a hacer —dijo Troy suavemente. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. —¿Te lo quieres quedar? —preguntó Troy, de manera cuidadosa. —Aunque odie mucho que esto esté pasando justo ahora, sí quiero. No quiero abortar ni darlo en adopción —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. —No sería capaz de vivir tranquilo si tuvieras un aborto —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Necesitamos encontrar trabajos tan pronto como sea posible y empezar a ahorrar —dijo Troy. —Estoy de acuerdo —dijo Gabriella. Troy miró a su novia y pudo ver que estaba muy asustada. —Bebé —dijo Troy, suavemente. Gabriella miró a Troy. —Tú sabes que siempre estaré aquí para ti y para el bebé, ¿verdad? —dijo Troy. Gabriella miró a Troy y lágrimas bajaron por su rostro. Troy tomó a Gabriella en sus brazos y la dejó llorar. Frotó su espalda tranquilizadoramente e inhaló el aroma frutal de su cabello. Veinte minutos después, el llanto de Gabriella se convirtió en respiraciones, que luego se convirtieron en silencio. La pareja se quedó en los brazos del otro pensando sobre su futuro. —Te amo —dijo Troy. —Yo también te amo —dijo Gabriella. —Mírame, Brie —dijo Troy. Gabriella miró a Troy, que sus ojos también estaban rojos, por llorar. Como los suyos. —Vamos a superar esto —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Hubo un golpe en la puerta y María asomó su cabeza. —Gabi, te hice una cita con la Dra. Brand para mañana en la mañana —dijo María. —¿Quién es la Dra. Brand? —preguntó Troy. —Ginecóloga —dijo María. Troy asintió. —¿Quieres que vaya contigo? —preguntó Troy, mirando a Gabriella. Gabriella asintió. —Si quiere, puedo llevar a Gabs con la Dra Brand mañana. No quiero que tenga que tomar un día libre del trabajo por mi error —dijo Troy. María sonrió levemente. —¿Estás seguro Troy? Será su primera vez en una cita de ese tipo. ¿Van a estar bien? —preguntó María. —Pasaremos por esto juntos. Estaré aquí para Gabriella cuando me necesite, creo que me necesita más que nunca —dijo Troy. María asintió. —Está bien. Gracias Troy —dijo María. —No hay problema —dijo Troy. María salió del cuarto. Troy miró a Gabriella. —¿Necesitas que haga algo? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella negó con la cabeza. —Diles a tus padres que lo siento —dijo Gabriella. —Lo haré bebé. ¿Qué tal si tomas un baño caliente? Te relajará y te ayudará a despejar tu mente de esta pesadilla —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Se inclinó y besó los labios de Troy suavemente. —¿Seguirás aquí cuando salga? —preguntó Gabriella. —Si quieres que me quede —dijo Troy. —Sí quiero —dijo Gabriella. —Está bien —dijo Troy. Gabriella entró al baño y cerró la puerta. Troy escuchó que se encendió la ducha y suspiró. Veinte minutos después, Gabriella salió del baño y estaba vestida con una de las camisetas de Troy y un short de básquetbol que robó de su casa después de quedarse a dormir. —¿Te sientes mejor? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. Caminó hacia Troy y lo abrazó. Troy puso su mano en la espalda baja de Gabriella. Besó su hombro suavemente. —¿Por qué no tomas una siesta? Tuviste un día muy agitado —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Se metió a la cama y Troy la arropó. Besó suavemente los labios de Gabriella. —Te amo. Estaré aquí mañana temprano para llevarte a tu cita, ¿sí? —dijo Troy. —Está bien. Yo también te amo —dijo Gabriella. Troy se inclinó y besó a Gabriella en los labios una última vez. Depsués miró al estómago de Gabriella y besó su ombligo. —También te amo a ti, bebé —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió. —Te veré mañana. Duerme un poco amor —dijo Troy. —Discúlpame con tus padres por mí, Troy —repitió Gabriella. —Lo haré —dijo Troy. Troy salió de la casa de Gabriella y condujo a su casa. Cuando entró a su casa vio a su madre en la cocina. —¿Troy? —lo llamó Lucille. Troy entró a la cocina. —¿Sí, mamá? —preguntó Troy. —¿Cómo está Gabi? —preguntó Lucille. —¿Antes o después de que llorara en mis brazos? —preguntó Troy. —Estará así un tiempo, Troy. Ella es la que lleva un bebé dentro —dijo Lucille. Troy asintió. —Mañana tiene una cita con el doctor y necesito llevarla. María no pudo librarse así que yo la voy a llevar —dijo Troy. —Está bien. ¿Necesitan que vaya con ustedes? Iré si quieren —dijo Lucille. —Creo que deberíamos hacerlo solos. Gabs está nerviosa y no creo que quiera que la veas justo después de que se enteró. Necesita tiempo —dijo Troy. —Está bien —dijo Lucille. —No es que no quiera que vayas, pero creo que no sabe qué esperar, y yo tampoco. Queremos ver cómo sale todo nosotros solos —dijo Troy. —Yo entiendo, Troy —dijo Lucille. —¿Papá sigue molesto? —preguntó Troy. —Sigue arriba, pero ya se calmó un poco hace rato —dijo Lucille. —¿Debería ir e intentar hablarle? —preguntó Troy. —Inténtalo, a ver qué pasa —dijo Lucille. Troy asintió. Salió de la cocina y subió las escaleras. Troy vio a su padre en su oficina viendo viejos partidos de básquetbol. Carraspeó y tocó la puerta. Jack se volteó y miró a Troy. —Papá… —comenzó a Troy. —Siéntate. Tenemos que hablar —dijo Jack. Troy se sentó en la silla que estaba frente a su escritorio. —Troy, ¿entiendes que esto puede afectar tu futuro? Tal vez ya no seas capaz de jugar básquetbol por el bebé —Jack dijo. —Gabriella y el bebé son mi futuro, papá. Ya hice esa decisión —dijo Troy. —También necesitar ir a la escuela. Una beca como la tuya no se da tan seguido —dijo Jack. Troy tomó aire. —¡Olvida la beca! Tendré un hijo papá. Mi futuro son Gabriella y el bebé —dijo Troy secamente. —Si no vas a la escuela, debes mudarte —dijo Jack. —Bien. Mis cosas estarán fuera antes de que acabe el día. Gracias por tu ayuda —dijo Troy secamente. Troy salió de la oficina y entró a su cuarto y sacó una maleta y empezó a empacar. Lucille entró al cuarto y vio a su hijo, confundida. —¿Qué estás haciendo? —preguntó Lucille. —Me dijo que si no tomaba la beca me tengo que mudar. No tomaré la beca, entonces me voy —dijo Troy. —¿A dónde irás? —preguntó Lucille mientras veía a su hijo empacar. —No lo sé. Tal vez con Chad porque sé que María probablemente no me deje quedarme más en su casa —dijo Troy. Troy terminó de empacar sus cosas y caminó a la puerta frontal. —Llámame para decirme si estas a salvo, por favor —dijo Lucille. —Lo haré —dijo Troy. Troy salió y condujo a la casa de Gabriella. Escaló al balcón y entro al cuarto de Gabriella, y la vio sentada en la cama. —Hola bebé, ¿pudiste dormir? —preguntó Troy. —Un poco —dijo Gabriella. —Papá me echó —dijo Troy. Los ojos de Gabriella se ensancharon. —Troy —dijo Gabriella. —Me dijo que si no tomaba la beca en la UDA me tendría que mudar. Así que me mudé —explicó Troy. —¿Qué dijo tu mamá? —preguntó Gabriella. —No dijo mucho, pero sabe que estoy aquí o con Chad. Pero le dije que me quedaría aquí solo si tu mamá me lo permite —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió. —Eres el padre de mi hijo y el amor de mi vida. Si no te deja quedarte, también me mudaré —dijo Gabriella. —¿Dónde nos quedaríamos si nos mudamos, Brie? —preguntó Troy. —En la casa del árbol —dijo Gabriella. Troy soltó una risa. —Muy graciosa. Para ser una mujer embarazada, eres muy graciosa —dijo Troy. —Necesito un poco de risa después de todo el drama de hoy —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. —¿Por qué no duermes un poco y yo voy a hablar con tu mamá? —dijo Troy. —Está bien, si me necesitas, despiértame —dijo Gabriella. —Lo haré —dijo Troy besando suavemente los labios de Gabriella. Troy salió del cuarto y cerró la puerta lentamente. Después bajó las escaleras, fue a la cocina y vio a María sentada en la barra con su computadora. —¿Interrumpo? —preguntó Troy. María volteó a ver a Troy y sonrió. —No, siéntate —dijo María. Troy se sentó en la barra y vio a su segunda madre. —No sé cómo expresar cuánto lo siento, mamá. Usé protección y todo, pero el condón se rompió —dijo Troy. —Lo entiendo Troy y no te odio —dijo María. Troy miró a María. —Tu madre llamó y habló conmigo un rato —dijo María, respondiendo la pregunta que Troy tenía en mente. —Solo quiero que los dos entiendan en qué se están metiendo —dijo María. Troy asintió. —Lo sé —dijo Troy. Troy y María escucharon a Gabriella llamar a Troy. —Iré a ver qué pasa —dijo Troy. María asintió. Troy subió las escaleras y fue al cuarto de Gabriella. —¿Qué pasa bebé? —preguntó Troy. —¿Ya le preguntaste? —preguntó Gabriella. —Aún no llego a eso. Déjame ir a preguntarle —dijo Troy. —Ven a la cama después —dijo Gabriella. —Lo haré —dijo Troy. Troy bajó las escaleras y María vio hacia arriba. —Está bien. Mi papá me echó de la casa —dijo Troy. —¿En serio? —preguntó María. Troy asintió. —Gabriella y yo queríamos saber si me puedo quedar para poder estar cerca en caso de que algo pase. Si no se siente cómoda, puedo quedarme con Chad —dijo Troy. —Puedes quedarte aquí Troy. Pero habrá algunas reglas —dijo María. —Está bien. ¿Cuáles son? —preguntó Troy. —Nada de actividad sexual en esta casa. Sé que Gabriella ya está embarazada. Pero no quiero que lo hagan en mi casa —dijo María. Troy asintió. —Usa la puerta frontal si llegas tarde a casa —dijo María. Troy asintió. —Y eso es todo lo que pido —dijo María. —Entendido —dijo Troy. —Muy bien, buenas noches Troy —dijo María. —Buenas noches mamá. Te quiero —dijo Troy. María sonrió. —Yo también te quiero —dijo María. Troy subió las escaleras y fue al cuarto de Gabriella. Se sentó y vio a su novio. Troy cerró la puerta, se quitó la camiseta y entró a la cama. —¿Qué dijo? —preguntó Gabriella. —Dijo que me puedo quedar, pero que hay ciertas reglas —dijo Troy. —¿Cuáles son las reglas? —preguntó Gabriella. —Nada de sexo en la casa y que tengo que usar la puerta después de la práctica o si llego tarde a casa —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. —En serio deberías dormir —dijo Troy. —Ahora podré hacerlo —dijo Gabriella. Troy besó suavemente los labios de Gabriella. —Buenas noches bebé. Te amo. Si necesitas algo, despiértame —dijo Troy. Gabriela asintió. —Buenas noches Lince. Yo también te amo —dijo Gabriella. La pareja se durmió en los brazos del otro y esperaron que en la cita de Gabriella al día siguiente saliera bien.'][Chapter 2] ['¡Hola! Les traigo el segundo capítulo de este Fanfic. Les comento que acabo de terminar de leer los tres y me gustaron mucho. Bueno, los dejo con el capítulo. Disfrútenlo. A la mañana siguiente, Gabriella se despertó con náuseas. Se sentó en la cama e intentó averiguar qué estaba pasando, pero al instante corrió al baño y cerró la puerta. Gabriella se sentó frente al escusado y agarró su cabello y regurgitó los restos de su estómago en la taza de porcelana. Mientras vomitaba, Gabriella sintió otra mano agarrar su cabello y un beso en su cabeza. Cuando terminó, Gabriella bajó la palanca del escusado y se recargó en el lavabo, sin saber quién la había ayudado. —¿Estás bien, bebé? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella negó con la cabeza. Volteó a ver a su novio con lágrimas en los ojos. Troy se sentó en el piso junto a Gabriella. —Estoy embarazada con tu bebé —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. Besó suavemente su cabeza. —¿Hay algo que quieras que haga? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella negó con la cabeza. La pareja se sentó en silencio por unos minutos hasta que Troy lo rompió. —Tenemos que alistarnos para ir a ver a la Dra. Brand —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —¿Estás asustado? —preguntó Gabriella suavemente. —Estoy petrificado. Pero, sé que nunca estaré tan asustado como tú —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Vamos, lávate la cara y cepíllate los dientes. Estaré abajo si me necesitas, ¿sí? —dijo Troy. —Espera —dijo Gabriella. Troy vio a Gabriella levantarse y cepillar sus dientes. Entonces Gabriella caminó hacia Troy y besó sus labios suavemente. —Buenos días —dijo Gabriella. Sonrió. Se inclinó y besó a Gabriella. —Buenos días, bebé. Necesitamos apurarnos. Tenemos que estar allá en una hora —dijo Troy mirando su teléfono. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. Troy salió del cuarto y bajó las escaleras, vio a María en la cocina, tomando una taza de café. —Buenos días Troy —dijo María. —Buenos días mamá —dijo Troy. —¿Cómo amaneció Gabriella? —preguntó María. —Vomitó, pero ya se siente mejor —dijo Troy. —Comenzaron las náuseas matutinas. Si aún se siente mal, hay té de manzanilla en la alacena para ayudarle con las náuseas —dijo María. —Bueno, gracias —dijo Troy. —Tengo que correr al trabajo. Pero, díganme cómo les fue con la Dra. Brand —dijo María. —Lo haré —dijo Troy. —Te quiero, Troy —dijo María. —Yo también te quiero mamá —dijo Troy. María salió de la casa. Veinte minutos después, Gabriella bajó las escaleras y vio a Troy sentado en la mesa de la cocina con dos platos de cereal y dos vasos con jugo de naranja. —¿Cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy. —Mejor. Creo que las náuseas matutinas ya empezaron —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. —Tu mamá se acaba de ir. Dijo que si no te sentías mejor que había té de manzanilla en la alacena que te podría ayudar con las náuseas —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Se sentó y la pareja comió en silencio. Después de que terminaron, pusieron sus platos en el lavabo. —¿Estás lista para irte? —dijo Troy. —Sí —dijo Gabriella, nerviosa. —No te preocupes bebé. Estaré contigo todo el tiempo —dijo Troy. —Solo me da miedo —dijo Gabriella. —Lo sé —dijo Troy. La pareja salió de la casa y llegaron a la oficina de la Dra. Brand. Gabriella tuvo que llenar unas formas porque era la primera vez que iba a algo así. Después de que terminó, Gabriella se sentó junto a Troy y entrelazó sus dedos. Troy frotó el pulgar de Gabriella, que estaba temblando. Lo besó tiernamente. Una enfermera vino al cuarto con un documento y vio a los pacientes que estaban esperando. —¿Gabriella Montez? —llamó la enfermera. Troy y Gabriella se pusieron de pie y caminaron detrás de la enfermera. Los llevó a un cuarto donde Gabriella fue revisada de presión, temperatura, peso y altura. La pareja después fue llevada al consultorio. —Gabriella, por favor ponte esta bata. Quítate la ropa interior y el sostén también. La Dra. Brand no tarda en venir —dijo la enfermera. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. La enfermera salió del cuarto. —¿Quieres que me salga mientras te cambias? —preguntó Troy. —Hemos estado juntos por casi cinco años Troy. Me has visto desnuda miles de veces —dijo Gabriella. —Solo quiero asegurarme de que estés cómoda, es todo —dijo Troy. —Lo sé, y gracias por preguntar —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella se puso la bata y se sentó en la mesa de examinación. Troy tomó su mano y sintió que estaba temblando. Tocaron la puerta y la Dra. Brand que tenía cabello largo y castaño, entró al cuarto. —Hola Gabriella, ¿quién es él? —preguntó. —Él es mi novio, Troy —dijo Gabriella. —Hola Troy —dijo la Dra. Brand. —Hola —dijo Troy. —Gabriella, aquí dice que te hiciste una prueba de embarazo y salió positiva —dijo la Dra. Brand. Gabriella asintió. —Mi mamá quería saber cuánto tiempo tengo —dijo Gabriella. La Dra. Brand asintió. —Bien, vamos a dar un vistazo —dijo. La Dra. Brand se lavó las manos y prendió el ultrasonido. Levantó la bata de Gabriella arriba de su ombligo. La Dra. Brand sintió que Gabriella estaba muy asustada y puso su mano en el hombro de ella. —Gabriella, sé que tienes miedo y es completamente normal, si te hago sentir incómoda de cualquier manera me avisas, ¿sí? —dijo la Dra. Brand, dulcemente. Gabriella asintió. Troy miró a Gabriella y besó suavemente su cabeza. Una vez que el ultrasonido se calentó, la Dra. Brand tomó un bote de gel. —Puede que esté un poco frío —dijo la Dra. Brand. Puso un poco del producto en el estómago de Gabriella. Ella se sobresaltó por la temperatura, pero luego se relajó una vez que se acomodó en la piel. La Dra. Brand guardó la botella y tomó la vara que estaba conectada al ultrasonido. —Bien, ¿estás lista? —preguntó. Gabriella miró a Troy, quien le sonrió y asintió. —Estamos listos —dijo Gabriella. La Dra. Brand acomodó la vara en el estómago de Gabriella y comenzó a mover el gel alrededor. Miró al monitor y señaló. —¿Ven ese punto? Es su bebé —dijo la Dra. Brand. Troy y Gabriella miraron al monitor y los dos se sorprendieron. Troy besó suavemente la cabeza de Gabriella y limpió sus lágrimas. La Dra. Brand movió la vara alrededor del estómago de Gabriella. —Tienes cinco semanas —dijo la Dra. Brand. —Tiene poco —dijo Gabriella. La Dra. Brand asintió. —Papá, ¿Qué piensas? —preguntó la Dra. Brand. Troy sonrió y miró al monitor. —Me hace sentirlo más real verlo —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió en acuerdo. —Déjenme ir a imprimir estas fotos para ustedes y volveré, ¿sí? —dijo la Dra. Brand. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. La Dra. Salió del cuarto. Gabriella miró a su novio y vio lágrimas corriendo por su rostro. Ella las limpió rápidamente. —Se supone que debo ser el fuerte en esto —dijo Troy, llorando. Gabriella sonrió y se inclinó para besar los labios de Troy. —No siempre. Te amo Troy —dijo Gabriella. —Yo también te amo, bebé. Mucho. Eres muy valiente —dijo Troy, acomodando el cabello de Gabriella. Gabriella sonrió mientras las lágrimas bajaban por sus mejillas. —Ni siquiera sé por qué estoy llorando —dijo Gabriella mientras se limpiaba las lágrimas. —Es abrumador —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Tocaron la puerta y la Dra. Brand regresó al cuarto. —Bien Gabriella, necesito examinarte. Troy, ¿te quieres quedar o quieres esperar afuera? —preguntó la Dra. Brand. Gabriella apretó el agarre en la mano de su novio. —Se queda —dijo Gabriella, contestando por Troy. Troy sonrió. Gabriella miró a Troy. —Perdón, pero te quedas —dijo Gabriella. —De todos modos, quería quedarme —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Bien Gabriella. Necesito que separes tus piernas —dijo la Dra. Brand. Gabriella separó sus piernas y tomo un profundo, tembloroso respiro. —Todo está bien bebé, relájate —dijo Troy. —Esta es la parte que estaba temiendo —murmuró Gabriella. —Aquí estoy, bebé —dijo Troy. La Dra. Brand se puso unos guantes nuevos y miró a Gabriella. —Gabriella, necesito que tomes un respiro profundo —dijo la Dra. Gabriella respiró como le dijo la Dra. Y también lo hizo Troy. Un momento después, Gabriella gruñó y apretó su agarre en Troy. —Gabriella, relájate. Necesito revisar y asegurarme que todo esté bien —dijo la Dra. Troy miró a Gabriella, que luchaba por no llorar del miedo. —Bebé, solo mírame —dijo Troy. Gabriella miró a Troy. Troy le ayudó a Gabriella a respirar. Unos momentos después, la Dra. Brand miró hacia arriba y tiró los guantes. —Todo se ve bien, Gabriella. Aquí hay una receta para que te den unas vitaminas prenatales que debes tomar diario hasta que te vea el próximo mes. Llámame si tienes preguntas —dijo la Dra. Brand dándole la receta a Troy. —Gracias Dra. Brand —dijo la pareja. La Dra. Brand salió de la oficina. Troy miró a Gabriella. —¿Estás bien? —preguntó Troy. —Eso fue muy incómodo —dijo Gabriella. —Lo siento amor. Ella necesitaba revisarte —dijo Troy. Gabriella se cambió a la ropa que traía y la pareja fue a la farmacia que estaba en el complejo médico y compraron las vitaminas prenatales. La pareja condujo a casa. —¿Cómo te sientes después de esto? —preguntó Troy. —El embarazo da miedo —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —No esperaba nada de eso. Pensé que solo haría el ultrasonido y ya —dijo Troy. —Sí, yo también. ¿Podemos ir a tu casa? Quiero ver a tu mamá —dijo Gabriella. —Seguro, bebé —dijo Troy. —Gracias —dijo Gabriella. Troy condujo a su casa y estacionó el auto en la calle. La pareja se bajó y entró a la casa. —¿Mamá? —llamó Gabriella. —En la cocina, cariño —dijo Lucille. Gabriella entró a la cocina y fue abrazada por su segunda madre. —Fuimos hoy al doctor —dijo Gabriella. —¿Cómo les fue? —preguntó Lucille. —Tenemos fotos —dijo Gabriella. —Déjame verlas —dijo Lucille. Gabriella le dio la ecografía a Lucille. Lucille la vio y sonrió. —¿Cuánto tienes? —preguntó Lucille. —Cinco semanas —Gabriella dijo. Lucille abrazó a Gabriella de nuevo y besó suavemente su mejilla. —Si necesitas algo, dime, ¿sí? —dijo Lucille. Gabriella asintió mientras lágrimas corrían por sus mejillas. —Perdón por todos los problemas que he causado, mamá. Lo siento mucho —dijo Gabriella. Lucille le señaló a Troy que saliera de la cocina para que las dos pudieran hablar. Troy salió. Lucille se sentó en la barra de la cocina y señaló el banco que estaba al lado de ella. Gabriella se sentó. —Gabi, sabes que te quiero cariño. Esto solo fue un golpe y una responsabilidad que no queríamos que enfrentaran tú y Troy como adolescentes —explicó Lucille. Gabriella asintió. —Arruiné su futuro, mamá. Lo arruiné —chilló Gabriella. —Cariñó, él se lo arruinó. Esto es responsabilidad de los dos —dijo Lucille. Gabriella tomó aire y lo soltó. —¿Está aquí el entrenador? —preguntó Gabriella. Lucille asintió. —Quiero hablar con él —dijo Gabriella. Lucille asintió, sabiendo que no había manera de cambiar la decisión de Gabriella. Gabriella besó la mejilla de Lucille. —Te quiero, mamá —dijo Gabriella. —Yo también te quiero cariño —dijo Lucille. Gabriella subió las escaleras a la oficina de Jack y tocó la puerta, que estaba abierta. Jack volteó y suspiró. Los ojos de Gabriella se llenaron de lágrimas. —Papá, lo siento mucho —chilló Gabriella. Los ojos de Jack se suavizaron mientras veía a su \"hija\" llorar. Se levantó y le indicó a Gabriella que se acercara. Jack abrazó a Gabriella y la dejó llorar en sus brazos. Una vez que Gabriella se calmó, miró a Jack. —Papá, acerca de la mudanza de Troy… —comenzó Gabriella. —Gabi, él tomó la decisión. No digo que haya sido mala. Pero no irá a la escuela —dijo Jack. —Yo tampoco. Probablemente no tenga oportunidad, pero Troy sí. Tal vez, cuando se suponga que empecemos nuestro segundo año en la universidad, pueda empezar el primer año. Solo para asegurarnos que estamos estables —dijo Gabriella. —No será fácil —dijo Jack. —Sé que no. Pero, siempre nos dijo que peleemos por lo que queremos. Bueno, eso es lo que Troy quiere. Troy quiere comprometerse conmigo y el bebé. En el futuro, puede ir a la UDA, pero ahora mismo tiene prioridades —dijo Gabriella. Jack suspiró. —Solo necesito tiempo, Gabi —dijo Jack. —Lo entiendo. Tuvimos cita con el doctor hoy y me hicieron un ultrasonido. Las fotos están abajo con mamá —dijo Gabriella. Jack asintió. Gabriella se levantó y caminó a la salida cuando Jack le llamó. —Gabriella —dijo Jack. Gabriella miró a Jack. —Te quiero y siempre serás la hija que nunca tuve. Solo necesito tiempo para procesarlo, ¿sí? —dijo Jack. Gabriella asintió. —Yo también te quiero —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella bajó las escaleras y vio a Troy hablando con Lucille. Troy miró a Gabriella. —¿Hablaste con él? —preguntó Lucille. Gabriella asintió. —¿Hablaste con papá? —preguntó Troy. —Sí —dijo Gabriella. —¿Qué te dijo? —preguntó Troy. —Le dije que probablemente tengas que empezar la escuela un año después de lo esperado y que necesitaba aceptarlo —dijo Gabriella. —¿Y qué contestó? —preguntó Troy. —Está pensando en todo —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. Gabriella bostezó. —Troy, ¿por qué no llevas a Gabi a casa? Probablemente está exhausta y necesita dormir —dijo Lucille. —Estoy bien, mamá, en serio —dijo Gabriella. —No. Quiero ir a casa de todos modos —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Adiós mamá —dijeron Troy y Gabriella. La pareja salió de la casa y regresó a casa de Gabriella. Troy estacionó el auto y la pareja entró a la casa. —¿Mamá? —llamó Gabriella. —En la cocina —dijo María. La pareja entró a la cocina. Gabriella le dio la ecografía a María. Lo vio y sonrió levemente. —¿Qué les dijo la Dra. Brand? —preguntó María. —Tengo cinco semanas. Me dio vitaminas prenatales —dijo Gabriella. María asintió. —Fuimos a mi casa y hablamos con mis padres —dijo Troy. —¿Cómo estuvo? —preguntó María. —Hablé con Jack y estaba un poco más comprensivo que antes —dijo Gabriella. —Bien, ¿cómo te sientes? —preguntó María. —Cansada y abrumada —dijo Gabriella. —Ve a dormir. Te hablaré cuando la cena esté lista —dijo María. Gabriella y Troy subieron al cuarto de Gabriella. Troy cerró la puerta. Gabriella abrazó a su novio y soltó las lágrimas que estuvo aguantando. —¿Estás bien? —preguntó Troy. —Por favor dime que todo estará bien —chilló Gabriella. Troy besó suavemente la cabeza de Gabriella. —Todo estará bien bebé. No te preocupes —dijo Troy. La pareja tomó una siesta e intentaron alejar sus mentes del hecho de que serían padres en ocho meses.'][Chapter 3] ['¡Hola!, hoy les traigo el tercer capítulo de este fic. En cuanto al mío de THG, lo tengo pausado momentáneamente, ya que, por la universidad me es más difícil escribir algo desde cero como el de THG. Pero por mantener actualizado, me es más rápido traducir este. Entonces estaré subiéndolo más. Disfrútenlo. Una hora después, la pareja escuchó que María los llamaba para cenar. Bajaron las escaleras, se sentaron a la mesa y empezaron a comer. —Hoy hablé con el maestro Matsui —dijo María. —¿En serio? Por favor dime que no le contaste —suplicó Gabriella. —Tuve que contarle Gabi. Vas a perder la escuela y necesitamos un plan —dijo María. —¿Mi opinión no cuenta? —preguntó Gabriella. —Bebé, tal vez mamá tiene razón —dijo Troy. —No voy a perder la escuela mamá —dijo Gabriella. —Gabi, necesitas tener tiempo para descansar y no estresarte —dijo María. —Pero… —comenzó Gabriella. —Sin peros cariño. Sé que es difícil, pero es la decisión que tomaste —dijo María. —Troy —dijo Gabriella. Troy suspiró. —Brie, será difícil. Sé que no quieres perder la escuela, lo entiendo perfecto. Pero, no queremos que te estreses cuando estás embarazada o que estés corriendo y pensando en tareas. Necesitas descansar por el bebé —explicó Troy. Una lágrima bajó por el rostro de Gabriella. No estaba enojada con su madre y Troy. Solo le era difícil pensar cómo su vida dio un giro en un par de días. —¿Puedo levantarme? —preguntó Gabriella. —Apenas has tocado tu comida, Gabi —dijo María. —No tengo hambre —dijo Gabriella. —Está bien cariño —dijo María. Gabriella se levantó y limpió sus lágrimas. Subió las escaleras y Troy pudo escuchar que Gabriella comenzó a llorar mientras cerraba la puerta de su cuarto. Troy y María terminaron de cenar en silencio. Después de que terminaron, Troy tuvo una idea. —Oye mamá, ¿dónde está la mantequilla de maní? —preguntó Troy. María sonrió sabiendo lo que Troy estaba pensando. —Eres un amor —dijo María. Troy sonrió. —Entiendo que está enojada por lo de la escuela. Pero, tendremos un bebé y hay muchas cosas que vienen a raíz de eso. Creo que está muy abrumada —dijo Troy mientras María le pasaba el frasco de mantequilla de maní. —Eso creo también. Creo que cuando se le pase la sorpresa, entenderá —dijo María. Troy asintió mientras hacia el sándwich de mantequilla de maní y jalea para Gabriella. Miró a María. —Le llevaré esto —dijo Troy. —Esperemos que la haga sentirse un poco mejor —dijo María. Troy subió las escaleras con la comida favorita de su novia. Tocó la puerta. —Brie, ¿puedo pasar? —preguntó Troy a través de la puerta. Troy escuchó un ahogado \"sí\" y abrió la puerta. —¿Estás bien? —preguntó Troy cuidadosamente. Gabriella miró a Troy con lágrimas en los ojos. —Te traje algo que tal vez te haga sentirte mejor —dijo Troy poniendo el plato en el regazo de Gabriella. Gabriella sonrió con lágrimas en los ojos. —Te amo —dijo Gabriella. —Yo también te amo —dijo Troy. Gabriella comió y Troy la miró. —Entonces, ¿podemos hablar de esto? —preguntó Troy. —Quiero quedarme en la escuela —dijo Gabriella. —Ya lo sé bebé. Pero, no podrás ir a clases cuando tengas nueve meses de embarazo —dijo Troy. —Me volveré loca sin la escuela —dijo Gabriella. —Tal vez algunos de tus maestros me dejen llevarte las tareas y después entregarlas por ti —dijo Troy. Gabriella se encogió de hombros. —Podemos intentarlo y ver qué pasa —dijo Troy. —¿Cómo le diré a Tay? —dijo Gabriella, cambiando de tema. —Tienes que sentarte a platicarlo con ella. Se dará cuenta eventualmente bebé. Pero también deberías decirle —dijo Troy. —Va a estar muy enojada —dijo Gabriella. —Es probable. Pero, tienes que decirle. Es tu mejor amiga, Brie —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —¿Debería ir con ella ahora? —preguntó Gabriella. —¿No crees que es un poco tarde bebé? —preguntó Troy. —Solo quiero terminar con esto —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. Se levantó de la cama de Gabriella y tomó sus llaves. —Vámonos —dijo Troy. Gabriella se levantó y besó suavemente a Troy en los labios. —Tu sándwich me hizo sentir mucho mejor, por si te lo preguntabas —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —Bien —dijo Troy. La pareja bajó las escaleras y vieron a María leyendo en la sala- —¿A dónde van? —preguntó María. —Vamos a casa de Tay para decirle sobre el bebé —dijo Gabriella. —Regresen antes de que anochezca, por favor —dijo María. —Lo haremos —dijo Gabriella. Troy y Gabriella salieron de la casa. Troy condujo a la casa de Taylor y estacionó el auto. —¿Lista para ser sermoneada? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella soltó una risita. —No será tan malo —dijo Gabriella. —Brie, Tay es la reina de la ciencia, como tú. Va a sermonearnos sobre cómo no escuchamos la clase de sexo y reproducción en biología —dijo Troy. Gabriella soltó una risa. —Vamos —dijo Gabriella. La pareja bajó del auto y caminaron a la puerta frontal. Gabriella tocó el timbre y Taylor abrió la puerta. —Hola chicos, ¿cómo están? —preguntó Troy. —Tenemos que hablar contigo, Tay —dijo Gabriella. —¿Hice algo malo? —preguntó Taylor. —No, solo necesitamos hablar contigo —dijo Gabriella. —Pasen —dijo Taylor. La pareja entró a la casa y subieron al cuarto de Taylor. Taylor cerró la puerta. —Entonces, ¿de qué me querían hablar? —preguntó Taylor. Gabriella miró a Troy y asintió. —Te vas a enojar con nosotros, pero lo que pasó, pasó y no hay nada que podamos hacer —dijo Troy. Taylor miró confundida a la pareja. —¿Qué hicieron? —preguntó Taylor. Gabriella sacó la ecografía y se lo dio a Taylor. Taylor lo vio y tomó aire, sorprendida. —No —dijo Taylor. —Tengo cinco semanas —dijo Gabriella. —Gabriella, ¿cómo pudiste ser tan… tan...? agh —comenzó Taylor. —¿Estúpida? Lo sé, Taylor —dijo Gabriella. —Acabas de arruinar todo por lo que has trabajado, Gabs. Tu promedio, tus actividades extracurriculares… ¿todo por qué?, ¿¡por amor!? —preguntó Gabriella. Gabriella se limpió las lágrimas que caían de sus ojos. Troy masajeó suavemente la espalda de Gabriella. —Tay —comenzó Troy. —No me digas que estoy sobreactuando Troy. Porque no lo estoy —dijo Taylor, señalándolo. —Quiero irme a casa —murmuró Gabriella. —Bueno, bebé. Te llevaré a casa —dijo Troy. —¿Me prestas tus llaves? —preguntó Gabriella tranquilamente. Troy le dio a Gabriella las llaves del auto y salió del cuarto. —Tay, sabemos que nos equivocamos. Pero Brie ahora mismo necesita a una amiga. Está muy asustada y tú la sermoneaste. Sin pensar en cómo se sentía —dijo Troy. Las lágrimas bajaban por el rostro de Taylor. —Necesito tiempo —dijo Taylor. Troy asintió. —Eso lo he escuchado mucho últimamente —dijo Troy. Troy salió de la casa y vio a Gabriella sentada en el auto con la cabeza apoyada contra la ventana. Se subió al auto y miró a Gabriella. —Brie —comenzó Troy. —Soy una estúpida —chilló Gabriella. —Bebé, no eres tonta. Cometimos un error. Sí, debimos ser más cuidadosos. Pero esto es lo que ahora está pasando y no hay nada que podamos hacer para detenerlo. Tay solo está enojada. Se le pasará —dijo Troy. —Quiero ir a casa —dijo Gabriella. —Está bien, te llevaré a casa —dijo Troy. Troy condujo a casa y estacionó su auto. La pareja salió de él y entró a la casa. —¿Cómo les…? —comenzó María, pero se detuvo cuando vio a Gabriella subir las escaleras corriendo. Troy y María escucharon la puerta del cuarto azotarse. —Supongo que no les fue muy bien —dijo María. Troy suspiró y negó con la cabeza. —Sermoneó a Brie y no la apoyó. Dijo que necesita tiempo —dijo Troy. María asintió. —Iré a intentar hablar con ella —dijo Troy. María asintió. —Gracias —dijo María. Troy sonrió. —Es mi trabajo —dijo Troy. —No solo por eso Troy. Apoyaste a Gabriella cuando más te necesitó. No huiste de esto. Eso significas más que cualquier otra cosa —dijo María. Troy sonrió. —La amo con todo mi corazón, mamá. Es el amor de mi vida aún antes de que descubriera que está embarazada, sabía que quería casarme con ella y pasar el resto de mi vida con ella —dijo Troy. María sonrió. —Te dejaré que vayas a ver cómo está —dijo María señalándole las escaleras. Troy sintió. —Pero gracias, mamá. Por decirme que algo estoy haciendo bien —dijo Troy. María asintió y sonrió. —Eres mi hijo —dijo María. Troy sonrió. Subió las escaleras y fue al cuarto de Gabriella, que tenía la puerta cerrada. —¿Brie? —habló Troy a través de la puerta. —No quiero hablar ahora Troy —dijo Gabriella y Troy pudo jurar que la escuchó llorando. —Bueno. Sabes dónde estaré si me necesitas —dijo Troy. Troy bajó las escaleras y fue a la sala y comenzó a hacer su tarea cuando María entró. —¿Habló contigo? —preguntó María. —Quiere estar sola. Creo que lo que dijo Tay en serio la lastimó —dijo Troy. —Se siente sola y asustada. Tenemos que hacerla sentir que tiene personas alrededor que la aman y la apoyan —dijo María. Troy asintió. —Eso me recuerda, tengo que hablar con Chad. Dios, no sé qué tanto me dirá —dijo Troy poniendo su cabeza en sus manos. María puso su mano en el hombro de Troy. —Chad entenderá —dijo María. —La UDA es algo de lo que nuestros padres han hablado desde que nos conocimos. Y el hecho de que no podré ir con él lo matará —dijo Troy. —Habla con él y ve cómo sale todo —dijo María. —¿Puedo invitarlo a venir? —preguntó Troy. —Claro cariño. Estás haciendo bien todo, Troy. Estoy orgullosa de ti —dijo María. Troy sonrió levemente. —Gracias —dijo Troy. Troy llamó a Chad y le dijo que viniera a casa de Gabriella. Diez minutos después, el timbre sonó y Troy abrió. —Canastas —dijo Chad saludando a su mejor amigo. —Tengo que hablar contigo hermano —dijo Troy. —¿Qué pasa? ¿Están bien Gabi y tú? —preguntó Chad. —Eso es de lo que te tengo que hablar Chad. Tal vez quieras sentarte —dijo Troy. Chad sintió que Troy necesitaba hablar de algo serio. Se sentó y Troy se sentó frente a él. —¿Qué pasa con nuestra Gabi? —preguntó Chad. Troy tomó aire y cerró los ojos. Quería elegir las palabras perfectas para la conversación. —¿Recuerdas que cuando éramos niños nuestros padres no dejaban de hablar sobre que jugáramos básquetbol en la UDA? —preguntó Troy. —Sí, pero ¿qué tiene que ver eso con Gabi? —preguntó Chad. Troy tomó aire y miró a su mejor amigo. —No iré Chad… al menos no cuando tú vayas. Chad miró confundido a Troy. —¿Por qué? Soñamos con esto toda nuestra vida Troy. No puedes no ir por Gabriella —dijo Chad. Troy levantó la mano, dándole a entender que aún no terminaba. Chad dejó de hablar y lo miró. Troy pasó saliva, no sabía que sería tan difícil. —No puedo ir cuando tú vayas Chad porque Gabriella está embarazada —dijo Troy. Hubo silencio. Nadie dijo nada por un par de minutos. Chad estaba mirando al piso intentando digerir las noticias. —Ella está… —dijo Chad, tratando de entender. Troy asintió. —¿Aún irá a Stanford? —preguntó Chad. —Aún no sabemos. Está muy enojada por eso —dijo Troy. —¿En dónde está? —preguntó Chad. —Arriba —dijo Troy. —¿Puedo ir a verla? —preguntó Chad. —Claro. Pero, ten cuidado con lo que le digas. Tay la sermoneó y está muy triste. Necesita que la apoyen —dijo Troy. Chad asintió. Se levantó y subió las escaleras. Chad tocó la puerta de su \"hermana pequeña.\" —¿Gabster? Soy Chad. ¿Puedo pasar? —preguntó Chad. Chad escuchó un ahogado \"sí\". Abrió la puerta y vio a Gabriella acostada. —Hey, Troy me acaba de decir la noticia —dijo Chad. Gabriella miró a sus pies, avergonzada por lo que había hecho. —¿También me vas a sermonear? —preguntó Gabriella. Chad negó con la cabeza. —Solo quería subir y ver si estabas bien. Troy me dijo que la reacción de Tay fue… bueno, Tay. Aún no caigo en cuenta de lo que está pasando, pero siempre estaré aquí para Troy y para ti, ¿sí? —dijo Troy. Gabriella tenía lágrimas bajando por su rostro. —Estoy muy asustada Chad —chilló Gabriella. Chad abrió sus brazos y Gabriella caminó hacia ellos y abrazó a su mejor amigo. —Sé que lo estás. Pero, hey, en un par de meses seré el tío Chad —dijo Chad. Gabriella sonrió. —Troy nunca confiaría dejarte solo con nuestro bebé —bromeó Gabriella. —¡Me duele que digas eso Gabriella!, nunca he lastimado a un niño mientras los cuido —dijo Chad, poniendo la mano en su corazón. Gabriella soltó una risita. —Troy y yo tenemos práctica en una hora. ¿Vas a estar bie…? —comenzó Chad. —Estaré bien. Mi mamá está aquí —dijo Gabriella. Chad sonrió y asintió. —Te quiero Gabs, recuérdalo siempre —dijo Chad. —Yo también te quiero Chaddy —dijo Gabriella. —Me tengo que ir. Traeré al papá para despedirse —dijo Chad. Gabriella rodó los ojos juguetonamente. —Hey, nunca dije que lo dejaría ir tan fácil —dijo Chad. Gabriella soltó una risita y asintió. —Adiós Chad —dijo Gabriella. Chad salió del cuarto y Gabriella suspiró de alivio. Eso salió mejor de lo que había pasado con Taylor. Gabriella fue sacada de sus pensamientos cuando un Troy sin camiseta entró al cuarto. —¿Te sientes mejor? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Al menos Chad nos apoya —dijo Gabriella. —Sí. La práctica solo dura una hora hoy. Así que volveré temprano —dijo Troy. —Bueno, ¿puedo ir contigo? Puedo terminar mi tarea en la biblioteca —dijo Gabriella. —¿Estás segura que te sientes bien para eso? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Bueno, alista tus cosas —dijo Troy. Gabriella se levantó de la cama y agarró sus libros. La pareja bajó las escaleras y salieron de la casa. Sabían que con el tiempo, todo estaría bien.'][Chapter 4] ['¡Hola!, he disfrutado mucho estar traduciendo este fic, tal vez no ha tenido tanto movimiento, pero en realidad es una historia que disfruté mucho. Les dejo el capítulo 4. Una semana después, Troy llegó a casa de la escuela y vio a Gabriella sentada en el sofá con una cobija sobre ella. —¿Qué haces en casa tan temprano? —preguntó Troy. —Vomité sobre mi escritorio en el laboratorio. La enfermera llamó a mamá para que fuera por mí —dijo Gabriella. El rostro de Troy se suavizó. —¿Por qué no me llamaste bebé? Yo te pude haber traído. Mi clase estaba junto a la tuya —dijo Troy. —Tienes que ir a la escuela, Troy. No puedes preocuparte por mí veinticuatro siete —dijo Gabriella. —Brie, vamos a tener un bebé… —comenzó Troy. —¡Ya sé que tendremos un bebé! Lo escucho todo el día, Troy. ¿Crees que no lo sé? Porque sí lo sé. Solo estoy intentando lidiar con todo esto y todo ha pasado muy rápido —dijo Gabriella, comenzando a llorar. —Gabs —dijo Troy suavemente. —No puedo hacerlo, ¿está bien? —chilló Gabriella. —Perdón por decirte todo eso. Solo estoy preocupado por ti Gabriella —dijo Troy. —Lo sé. Pero, no necesito estar bajo un microscopio todo el día —dijo Gabriella. Troy tomó aire y después lo soltó. —Perdón por gritarte. Solo estoy frustrada con todo esto —dijo Gabriella. —No te disculpes. Solo estás expresando cómo te sientes bebé. Es normal, y también es normal que te sientas frustrada. Yo estoy frustrado —dijo Troy. Gabriella se inclinó y besó suavemente los labios de Troy. Troy le devolvió el beso y después apoyó su frente en la de ella. —Lo siento —dijo Gabriella. —Está bien amor. ¿Cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy suavemente. —Creo que el estrés me sobrepasó. Sentía como si todos me estuvieran viendo, como si supieran lo que estaba pasando —dijo Gabriella. —Estás evadiendo mi pregunta —dijo Troy. —Me siento un poco mejor —dijo Gabriella. —¿Te preparaste té? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —No te preocupes por lo que otras personas digan. Enfócate en ti y en lo que estás haciendo —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Te amo —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —Yo también te amo. La próxima vez, si te sientes mal, por favor llámame —dijo Troy. —Lo haré y perdón por no hacerlo hoy —dijo Gabriella. —Nuestra primera discusión del embarazo, espero no haya muchas de esas —dijo Troy. —Esperemos —dijo Gabriella. —¿Por qué no duermes un poco? ¿Terminaste tu tarea? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Ve a dormir bebé —dijo Troy. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella besó suavemente los labios de Troy. Un par de semanas después, Troy estaba en clase de historia, que era impartida por su padre. Jack Bolton no solo entrenaba al equipo de básquetbol, sino que también impartía un par de clases diferentes en East High. Troy estaba escuchando la clase de su padre hasta que una mujer de la oficina administrativa entró al salón de clases. Susurró algo al oído de Jack, miró hacia arriba a Troy. La mujer salió del salón y Jack miró a Troy. —Troy —dijo Jack. —¿Sí? —preguntó Troy. Jack señaló a la puerta. Troy se veía confundido, pero juntó sus cosas y salió del salón. Cuando salió vio a la enfermera de la escuela con Gabriella. Troy caminó hacia ellas. —¿Qué pasó? —preguntó Troy. —Vomitó en trigonometría. Me dijo que te buscara —explicó la enfermera. Troy asintió. —Bebé, ¿cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy. —Mal —dijo Gabriella. La cara de Gabriella estaba caída y tenía sudor corriendo por su rostro. —¿Puedo firmar nuestra salida? —preguntó Troy a la enfermera. La enfermera le dio a Troy una forma para que la llenara. La llenó y tomó la mano de Gabriella. —Vamos amor. Te llevaré a casa —dijo Troy. La pareja caminó al auto de Troy y se subieron. Troy salió y de vez en cuando volteaba a ver a Gabriella. —Perdón porque te hayas tenido que salir de clase por mí —dijo Gabriella. —No te preocupes por eso Brie. Mi papá sabía que algo pasaba. Pero, qué bueno que me buscaste para que supiera lo que pasaba —dijo Troy. —Me dijiste que querías que te dijera si me sentía mal, así que lo hice —dijo Gabriella. —¿Es normal que vomites tres veces al día? —preguntó Troy. —No lo sé, pero, lo que sí sé es que es lo peor y lo odio —dijo Gabriella. Troy puso su mano en la rodilla de Gabriella. —Tal vez podemos preguntarle a tu mamá o a la Dra. Brand si es normal —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió, cansada. Troy se detuvo en la calle y estacionó su auto. La pareja bajó del auto y entró a la casa. María miró hacia arriba cuando Gabriella y Troy entraron a casa. —¿No se supone que deben estar en clase? —dijo María. —Vomitó y la enfermera me fue a buscar —dijo Troy. —¿Ya te sientes mejor cariño? —preguntó María. Gabriella se encogió de hombros. —Solo estoy cansada —dijo Gabriella. —¿Es normal que vomite tres veces al día, mamá? —preguntó Troy. —Yo vomitaba dos veces al día. Una en la mañana y una en la noche. Pero, voy a llamar a la Dra. Brand y ver qué recomienda —dijo María. Troy asintió. —Ve a dormir bebé —dijo Troy. Gabriella subió las escaleras, entró a su cuarto y cerró la puerta. —La enfermera entro a la clase de mi papá para buscarme —dijo Troy. —¿Vomitó en medio de la clase? —preguntó María. Troy asintió. —Vomitó en el laboratorio de biología. Me siento terrible —dijo Troy. —Es solo algo que viene con el embarazo, Troy. Debió haber algún olor que hizo que le dieran náuseas —María explicó. Troy asintió. —¿Qué hago? —preguntó Troy. —Solo estar ahí cuando ella te necesite. Es todo lo que puedes hacer —dijo María. Troy suspiró y pasó sus dedos por su cabello. —Sé que es difícil de verlo, pero no hay algo que puedas hacer —dijo María. —Sí, eso creo —dijo Troy. Troy subió las escaleras y vio a Gabriella tratando de ponerse cómoda en la cama. —¿Cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy. —Con náuseas y cansada —dijo Gabriella. —¿No se supone que debías estar durmiendo? —preguntó Troy. —No puedo dormir —dijo Gabriella. —¿Y eso por qué? —preguntó Troy cerrando la puerta detrás de él. —Solo estoy pensando en todo lo que ha pasado —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. —Es mucho qué pensar —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —En siete meses y medio, daré a luz a un bebé a los diecisiete años —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió mientras se acostaba junto a Gabriella en la cama. —Ni siquiera sé cómo dar a luz —dijo Gabriella. —Estoy seguro que la Dra. Brand nos platicará sobre el nacimiento cuando ya esté más cerca. Vas a ser una increíble mamá, Gabs. Será difícil, pero todo estará bien —dijo Troy. —También tengo miedo de perderte —dijo Gabriella con lágrimas en los ojos. Troy tomó la mano de Gabriella. —Mírame Brie —dijo Troy. Gabriella miró a su novio. —Nunca me vas a perder. Puede que tengamos peleas por varias cosas, pero siempre estaré aquí. Siempre te amaré sin importar qué. Llevas a nuestro bebé, amor —dijo Gabriella poniendo su mano en el estómago de Gabriella. Gabriella asintió. —Te amo. Por favor duerme un poco. Te ves exhausta —dijo Troy. —Yo también te amo, lo haré —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella cerró los ojos y se quedó dormida. Entonces Troy salió del cuarto y bajó las escaleras. Un par de semanas después, Gabriella tenía dos meses y medio de embarazo. La rutina diaria de Troy Gabriella consistía en Troy levantándose con Gabriella vomitando y llorando por una hora, yendo a la escuela sin poder poner atención, después ir a casa para escuchar cómo todos en la escuela hablaban de ellos. Troy consiguió un trabajo en la tienda mecánica que estaba al final de la calle y estaba generando una cantidad decente de dinero. Un día, Troy llegó a casa de un largo día en la escuela para después trabajar un turno de tres horas y vio a María masajeando la cabeza de Gabriella que estaba en su regazo. Gabriella tenía una cobija que la cubría hasta el cuello. Troy caminó hacia las dos mujeres y se arrodilló frente a Gabriella. —Hey bebé, ¿cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy. —Estoy engordando —chilló Gabriella. La mirada de Troy se suavizó. —Bebé, no estás gorda. Ni siquiera se te nota la barriga —dijo Troy. —No la has visto fuera de la cama hoy. Cariño, enséñale a Troy —dijo María. Gabriella ahogó un sollozo. Troy miró a su novia y se sintió muy mal porque no estaba en la cama cuando ella despertó. —Párate por favor, Brie. Déjame ver —dijo Troy, suavemente. Gabriella se levantó. Se puso de perfil y Troy vio la más pequeña barriga de bebé formándose en el estómago de Gabriella. Troy se levantó y abrió sus brazos, Gabriella entró en ellos. Abrazó firmemente a su novio. —Te ves hermosa Brie. No hay nada más bonito para mí que tú llevando a nuestro bebé. Ahora, se siente más real —dijo Troy besando suavemente la cabeza de Gabriella. —¿Lo dices en serio? —preguntó Gabriella con lágrimas en los ojos. Troy sonrió. —Claro que lo digo en serio. Hicimos un bebé, Brie. Estás llevando a mi hijo. Eso es algo muy hermoso —dijo Troy. Gabriella tomó aire y luego lo soltó. —¿Puedo verlo? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella se alejó de su novio y se puso de perfil. Presionó su camisa contra su estómago para que Troy pudiera ver su pequeña barriga. —Es hermosa y tú eres hermosa. Fin de la historia —dijo Troy besando la mejilla de Gabriella. —Gracias bebé —murmuró Gabriella. —Claro. Necesito ducharme, estoy cubierto de grasa —dijo Troy viendo a su ropa manchada. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. Troy salió del cuarto. Gabriella se acostó en su posición original. —Mami, ¿va a doler mucho? —preguntó Gabriella, refiriéndose al nacimiento. —Va a doler, Gabi. Pero, puedes pedir una epidural —dijo María. —¿Quita completamente el dolor como el Tylenol? —preguntó Gabriella. —Mejor que eso. Aún tendrás algo de sensibilidad ahí abajo para cuando tengas que pujar. Pero, solo será poco dolor —explicó María. —¿Troy puede quedarse conmigo? —preguntó Gabriella. —Claro que puede. Y si quieres, Lucille y yo podemos estar también —dijo María. —Tal vez todos puedan quedarse mientras esté en labor. Pero para el nacimiento quiero que estén tú y Troy ahí —dijo Gabriella. —Aún tenemos tiempo para hablar sobre eso —dijo María. Troy regresó a la sala y sonrío cuando vio a Gabriella en su posición original. —¿De qué hablamos, señoritas? Parece que hablan de algo serio —dijo Troy, sentándose en el piso en frente de Gabriella. —Estábamos hablando sobre el nacimiento —dijo María. —¿De qué? —preguntó Troy. —Tuve preguntas de mamá —dijo Gabriella. —Oh —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió levemente. —¿Está todo bien? —preguntó Troy. Las dos mujeres asintieron. —Gabi solo tenía unas preguntas para mí, es todo —dijo María dándose cuenta de que Gabriella no quería decirle a Troy de lo que estaban hablando. —Está bien, lo entiendo. Deberían hablar más. Tu mamá es una buena persona para hablar sobre eso porque ella ya lo vivió —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Más tarde esa noche, la pareja se alistó para dormir. Troy se quitó la camiseta, se metió a la cama, tomó aire y lo soltó. —¿Troy? —preguntó Gabriella. —¿Sí, bebé? —preguntó troy. —Quiero hablar contigo sobre lo que estaba platicando con mamá —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —Bebé, no tienes que hacerlo si no quieres —dijo Troy. —No, quiero hacerlo. Le pregunté a mi mamá si dolía mucho y la conversación creció y continuó —dijo Gabriella. —¿Qué te dijo sobre el dolor? —preguntó Troy. —Dijo que iba a doler, pero que me pueden poner una epidural —dijo Gabriella. —¿Y eso qué hace? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella sacudió su cabeza. —¿No escuchaste en biología? Una epidural es básicamente una aguja que se pone en la espalda para bloquear el dolor. Pero, mamá dijo que aún tendré algo de sensación allá abajo para que pueda pujar —dijo Gabriella. —Guau —dijo Troy. —Sí, no creo que pueda manejar el dolor. Tal vez sea la mejor opción. ¿Qué piensas? —preguntó Gabriella. —¿Es caro? —preguntó Troy. —Está cubierto por el seguro. Eso también lo aprendimos en biología —dijo Gabriella. —No pensé que tendría un bebé tan pronto así que omití eso y no escuché —dijo Troy. Gabriella sacudió su cabeza. —Troy, ¿qué piensas?, también tienes palabra en esta decisión —dijo Gabriella. —No quiero que sientas dolor. Si necesitas la epidural, por mí está bien —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —También le dije que quería que tú estés en la sala de parto conmigo —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —Habría estado ahí, aunque no quisieras —dijo Troy. —Ella también estará ahí con nosotros. Mamá me dijo que técnicamente ella, tu mamá y tú puede n estar conmigo. Le dijo que estaba bien cuando esté en labor. Pero para el parto, solo quiero a mamá y a ti —dijo Gabriella. —Creo que es lo mejor que solo estemos tu mamá y yo cuando tengas que empezar a hacer lo que sea que tengas que hacer para sacar al bebé —dijo Troy. —Pujar, Troy. Tengo que pujar para que el bebé salga —dijo Gabriella. El rostro de Troy se tiñó de rojo. —¿Te estás sintiendo incómodo? —preguntó Gabriella. —Un poco. Pero necesitamos hablar de esto —dijo Troy. —No tenemos que hablar de eso ahora. Pero solo quería empezar a hacer el plan de quién va a estar ahí —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. Gabriella bostezó y Troy sonrió. —Creo que la señorita planes necesita dormir un poco —dijo Troy. —Pero, ya estábamos hablando de esto —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió y besó suavemente la cabeza de Gabriella. —Podemos hablar esto en el momento que queramos, bebé. Aún nos quedan siete meses y medio. Ahora mi hijo y tú necesitan dormir —dijo Troy. Gabriella miró a Troy, incrédula. —¿Crees que el bebé es niño? —preguntó Gabriella. —Eso espero —dijo Troy. —Quiero que el bebé sea niña —dijo Gabriella. —Bueno, será uno u otro —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió, adormilada. —Duerme, bebé. No te resistas. Lo necesitas más que nunca —dijo Troy. —Te amo —dijo Gabriella adormilada. Troy sonrió. —Yo también te amo, Brie —dijo Troy. Al día siguiente, Gabriella entró al gimnasio en la práctica de básquetbol. Se sentó en la primera fila de las gradas. Jack sonrió cuando miró y vio a Gabriella sentada viendo al equipo jugar. —Hola, mamá —dijo Jack. Gabriella sonrió. —Hola papá —dijo Gabriella. —¿Cómo te sientes? —preguntó Jack mientras caminaba hacia ella. —Con un poco de náuseas, pero fuera de eso bien. Afortunadamente, hoy no vomité en biología —dijo Gabriella. Jack sonrió. —Tengo una cita con la doctora hoy, pero creo que a Troy se le olvidó —dijo Gabriella señalando a Troy. Jack asintió. —Me encargaré de eso. ¡Bolton! ¡Duchas, ahora! —llamó Jack. Troy miró a su padre y luego vio a Gabriella sentada en las gradas y se acordó. —¿Era hoy? —dijo Troy, refiriéndose a la cita. —No hagas preguntas. ¡Andando!, vamos —dijo Jack. Troy corrió a los casilleros y diez minutos después regresó corriendo. Gabriella abrazó al padre de su novio. —Espero esto no pase en los siguientes siete meses Troy —dijo Jack. —Honestamente, lo olvidé. ¿Estás lista para irnos? —preguntó Troy a Gabriella. Gabriella asintió. La pareja salió del gimnasio y llegaron al auto de Troy. —Lo siento mucho. En serio se me olvidó. Pensé que era la próxima semana —dijo Troy mientras conducía. —No te preocupes. Si no hubiera ido por ti, tal vez no te habrías acordado —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. —Eso es cierto. O me habría acordado hasta después de la práctica —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Me pregunto cómo se verá hoy —dijo Gabriella, refiriéndose al bebé. —Si tu barriga crece, ¿no significa que el bebé está creciendo también? —preguntó Troy. —Cierto —dijo Gabriella. Troy se estacionó en la oficina de la Dra. Brand. La pareja bajó del auto. Troy caminó hacia Gabriella y besó sus labios suavemente. —Perdón por olvidarlo —murmuró Troy. Gabriella besó suavemente los labios de Troy. —Que no vuelva a pasar, por favor —dijo Gabriella. —No pasará —dijo Troy. —Vamos a entrar —dijo Gabriella. La pareja entró a la oficina de la mano. Sabían que este embarazo sería un esfuerzo en equipo.'][Chapter 5] ['¡Hola!, he vuelto para traerles un nuevo capítulo de este fic, espero que disfruten mucho el capítulo número cinco. La pareja entró a la oficina, Gabriella se inscribió y después se sentó junto a Troy. Troy tomó la mano de Gabriella, entrelazó sus dedos y le dio un beso en el pulgar. Gabriella apoyó su cabeza en el hombro de su novio y cerró los ojos. —¿Cansada? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió con los ojos cerrados. Una enfermera entró a la oficina con un archivo. —¿Gabriella? —llamó la enfermera. La pareja se levantó y siguió a la enfermera a un pequeño cuarto donde los signos vitales de Gabriella fueron tomados para después llevarla a un consultorio. —¿Cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy. —Hoy no vomité en biología —dijo Gabriella. —Eso es bueno —dijo Troy. —Sí, pero, ahora que mi barriga está creciendo parece que todos comienzan a notarlo —dijo Gabriella. —No escuches lo que digan sobre ti, amor. No saben qué es lo que estás pasando —dijo Troy. —Hoy vi a Tay en la junta del decatlón —dijo Gabriella. —Oh, ¿te dijo algo? —preguntó Troy. —Comenzó elecciones para un nuevo presidente del equipo porque yo tengo un compromiso —dijo Gabriella, viendo a su barriga y poniendo sus manos en su regazo. Troy suspiró. Sabía que Gabriella se sentía terrible y traicionada por su mejor amiga. Gabriella miró a su novio con lágrimas bajando por su rostro. —Lo arruiné todo —chilló Gabriella. Troy se levantó y se puso frente a Gabriella para abrazarla. Besó su cabeza y frotó su espalda mientras ella lloraba. La Dra. Brand tocó la puerta y cuando entró al cuarto vio a la pareja en los brazos del otro. —¿Qué pasó aquí? —preguntó la Dra. Brand. Troy miró a Gabriella. —Solo está teniendo un mal día —dijo Troy. —Arruiné mi vida. Sé que no pueden decir si lo hice o no, pero perdí mi independencia, mi infancia, mi educación y mi mejor amiga. Todo en menos de dos meses —chilló Gabriella. Troy frotó suavemente la espalda de Gabriella. —Tienes razón, no puedo decir si arruinaste tu vida o no. Pero lo que sí sé, es que desde que has sido mi paciente por este corto tiempo, es que eres fuerte. Eres una mujer fuerte, Gabriella, y tienes una familia y un novio que te aman con locura —dijo la Dra. Brand. Gabriella miró a Troy, quien asintió y sonrió a su novia. Ella suspiró. —¿Listos para ver a su bebé? —preguntó la Dra. Brand. La pareja asintió. Gabriella se recostó en la mesa de examinación. Troy besó suavemente la mejilla de Gabriella. —Te amo mucho bebé —susurró Troy al oído de Gabriella. —Yo también te amo —Gabriella susurró. La Dra. Brand encendió el ultrasonido y movió la bata de Gabriella encima de su barriga. Después tomó un bote de gel y lo puso en el estómago de Gabriella. Después movió el gel con una vara. Después miró al monitor y sonrió. —Ahí está su bebé —dijo la Dra. Brand, apuntando a la pantalla. La pareja miró al monitor y sonrió. Gabriella tenía lágrimas bajando por su rosto y Troy las limpió. Ella miró a Troy, quien le sonrió. —¿Está sano? —preguntó Troy. —Sí, todo se ve normal y creció un poco también —dijo la Dra. Brand. —Lo esperábamos, porque mi barriga estaba creciendo —dijo Gabriella. —¿Cuándo podremos saber si es niño o niña? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella sonrió. —Podemos revisar si ya se ve si gustan —dijo la Dra. Brand. Troy miró a Gabriella. —¿Quieres saberlo? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Muy bien, vamos a ver —dijo la Dra. Brand. La Dra. Hart movió la vara alrededor del estómago de Gabriella y miró a la pantalla. —Ahí están los pies y ahí está la labia. Felicidades, tendrán una niña —dijo la Dra. Brand. Gabriella empezó a llorar. Troy sonrió y besó suavemente la cabeza de Gabriella. —¿Estás feliz, bebé? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió mientras lloraba. —Estoy muy feliz —chilló Gabriella. La Dra. Brand sonrió. Troy se veía confundido. —No te preocupes, Troy. Son los cambios hormonales los que la hacen llorar. Todo lo que puedes hacer es ayudarle a pasarlo —explicó la Dra. Brand. Troy asintió. —Está bien —dijo Troy. Gabriella tomó aire y luego lo soltó. Se limpió las lágrimas. —Lo siento —dijo Gabriella. —No te preocupes Gabriella. Si necesitas llorar, entonces llora —dijo la Dra. Brand. Troy sonrió. —¿Estás bien, Brie? —preguntó Troy. —Sí, solo estoy muy feliz. Al fin me siento feliz de tener a está bebé —dijo Gabriella. —Bien. Te amo —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió. Puso su mano en la mejilla de su novio. —Yo también te amo —dijo Gabriella. —Voy a imprimir estas fotos para ustedes y volveré —dijo la Dra. Brand dándole a Troy una toalla para ayudar a Gabriella a limpiarse. La Dra. Brand salió del cuarto. Gabriella tomó la toalla y se limpió su creciente estómago. Después tiró la tolla y abrazó a Troy por el cuello y besó sus labios. Troy se alejó y sonrió. —Mis chicas —dijo Troy poniendo su mano en la barriga de Gabriella. Gabriella sonrió y asintió. La Dra. Brand entró al cuarto y le dio a Troy la ecografía. —Muy bien, necesito examinarte Gabriella. ¿Puedes recostarte? —preguntó la Dra. Brand. Gabriella se recostó en la mesa de examinación y separó sus piernas. Tomó la mano de Troy y lo miró. Troy sonrió. —Solo respira, amor —dijo Troy suavemente. Gabriella tomó aire y gruñó cuando sintió a la Dra. Brand examinándola. —Solo respira, bebé. Todo está bien —dijo Troy. Gabriella gimió de dolor. —Sé que es incómodo Gabriella. Lo estás haciendo bien —dijo la Dra. Brand. —Mírame, Brie —dijo Troy, tratando de hacer que se concentrara. Gabriella miró a Troy. —Respira conmigo —dijo Troy. La pareja tomó respiros profundos hasta que la doctora terminó. —Todo se ve bien. Los veo el próximo mes —dijo la Dra. Brand tirando los guantes. Gabriella soltó el aire que estaba aguantando. —¿Ella está bien? —preguntó Gabriella. La Dra. Brand asintió. —Ella está bien. Está creciendo correctamente y no hay ninguna señal de estrés. Está muy bien, Gabriella. No te preocupes —dijo la Dra. Brand poniendo una mano en la rodilla de Gabriella. Gabriella asintió. —Gracias Dra. Brand —dijo Gabriella. —No hay problema. Los veo el próximo mes. Si tienen preguntas, no duden en llamar y preguntar —dijo la Dra. Brand. —Bueno —dijo Gabriella. La Dra. Brand salió del cuarto. Gabriella se sentó y miró a Troy. —Está sana. Eso es todo lo que importa ahora —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. —¿Troy? —preguntó Gabriella. —¿Sí, amor? —preguntó Troy. —¿Está bien que me sienta abrumada? —preguntó Gabriella, con lágrimas en los ojos. Troy se levantó frente a su novia embarazada. Puso un mechón de cabello detrás de la oreja de Gabriella y asintió. Gabriella abrazó a Troy por el cuello y lloró en su pecho. Troy abrazó a Gabriella por la cintura y puso una mano en su creciente barriga. Besó la frente de Gabriella. —Está bien que te sientas de esa manera —dijo Troy finalmente con lágrimas corriendo por su rostro. —Solo tenemos diecisiete —dijo Gabriella. —Lo sé… lo sé bebé. Sé que tienes mucho miedo —comenzó Troy. Troy ser alejó y puso una mano en el lado izquierdo de la mesa y la otra en el lado derecho. —Pero puedes… podemos hacerlo Gabs. Sé que no planeábamos tener un bebé tan pronto, pero está pasando. Aunque no fuera el padre de la bebé, aun así, estaría aquí porque eres mi mejor amiga. Vas a dar a luz a nuestra bebé, puede que sea difícil a veces, pero todo se ha estado acomodando. Puedes hacerlo, bebé. Sé que puedes —dijo Troy. Gabriella tenía lágrimas bajando por su rostro. Abrazó a Troy por el cuello y ahogó un sollozo. Troy frotó y le susurró cosas dulces en el oído de su novia. —Salgamos de aquí y vayamos a casa a relajarnos, ¿suena bien? Tal vez podamos ver cómo le diremos a nuestra familia que es niña, ¿no? —sugirió Troy. Gabriella asintió. Se inclinó y beso suavemente los labios de Troy. —Te amo —dijo Gabriella. —Yo también te amo Brie, mucho —dijo Troy. Gabriella se cambió de nuevo. La pareja salió de la oficina y fue a casa. Troy se estacionó, miró a Gabriella y sonrió. —¿Todo bien? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella sonrió y asintió. La pareja bajó del auto y entró a la casa. María sonrió a la pareja. —¿Cómo les fue con la doctora? —preguntó María. —Bien. Dijo que el bebé está sano y que creció a comparación del mes pasado, obviamente, por mi barriga —dijo Gabriella. —Bien. ¿Ya platicaron para saber el sexo? —preguntó María. —Hoy lo descubrimos —dijo Gabriella felizmente. —Pero, queremos esperar hasta mañana que estemos todos juntos —dijo Troy. María asintió. —Hagan sufrir a las mamás una noche más —bromeó María. La pareja sonrió. —Iré a dormir. Estoy muy cansada —dijo Gabriella. —Está bien, háblame si necesitas algo —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Se inclinó y besó suavemente los labios de Troy. Troy puso su mano en la barriga de Gabriella y sonrió. Se alejó y se arrodilló frente a Gabriella. —Papá te ama cariño —dijo Troy besando la barriga de Gabriella. Troy se levantó y Gabriella sonrió. —Duerme bien —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió y subió las escaleras. Troy miró a María cuando escuchó que se cerró la puerta. —Troy, ¿no puedes decirme? —preguntó María. Troy sonrió. —No puedo mamá. Brie me matará —dijo Troy. —No diré nada —dijo María. —No creo en tu palabra. ¿Recuerdas que cuando empezamos nuestra relación fuiste la primera a la que le dije que amaba a Brie? —preguntó Troy. María soltó una risita y asintió. Flashback. Decir que Troy estaba nervioso era poco. Él y Gabriella han estado juntos por un año y medio y quería decirle que la amaba, pero no sabía cómo. Troy entró a la casa de Gabriella, sabiendo que estaba en una junta del decatlón. Caminó a la puerta frontal y tocó el timbre. María abrió la puerta y sonrió. — Sabes que Gabi no está aquí, ¿verdad? —preguntó María. — Sí, lo sé. Necesito un consejo María —dijo Troy. María le pidió a Troy que entrara a la casa. María y Troy caminaron a la sala y se sentaron. — ¿Qué piensas Troy? —preguntó María. — Brie y yo hemos estado juntos por un año y medio y he estado intentando averiguar cómo decirle algo muy importante. Pero, estoy muy nervioso —dijo Troy. María sonrió. — ¿Es algo malo? —preguntó María. Troy sacudió su cabeza. — Quiero decirle que la amo, María —dijo Troy. Una semana después, Gabriella y María estaban en la cocina. — ¿Cómo está Troy? —preguntó María. — Está bien. Ha estado practicando el doble por el gran juego que viene —dijo Gabriella. — ¿No te ha dicho nada? —preguntó María. — No, ¿por qué? ¿Qué sabes mamá? —preguntó Gabriella. — Va a decirte que te ama, Gabi —dijo María. Gabriella sonrió. Fin del flashback. —Recuerdo lo asustado que estabas como para decirme. También me llamaste María y no mamá. Dios, cómo han cambiado las cosas —dijo María. Troy sonrió y asintió. —La amo, mamá. En serio la amo —dijo Troy. —Lo sé Troy. Desde que descubrió que está embarazada puedo verlo más y más —dijo María. Troy sonrió. —Siempre voy a amarla —dijo Troy. —Lo sé —dijo María. Troy y María hablaron por un rato más hasta que oyeron pisadas bajando las escaleras. Gabriella se detuvo en el último escalón y miró a su novio y su madre. Estaba vestida con una de las camisetas de práctica de Troy, que le llegaba arriba de la rodilla. —Gabriella —dijo María con voz ahogada. Troy se ahogó con el agua que estaba tomando. —Quiero estar cómoda cuando duermo. Tengo un bebé viviendo dentro de mí —dijo Gabriella. La cara de Troy se tornó rojo oscuro de la vergüenza. —Están siguiendo las reglas que les dije, ¿verdad? —preguntó María. —Sí mamá. No ha intentado nada conmigo —dijo Gabriella. Troy cubrió sus ojos con las manos tratando de hacer que el tiempo pasara más rápido. Marí sonrió sabiendo que ya había torturado a Troy lo suficiente. —Solo bromeo Troy —dijo María. Troy quitó las manos de su cara y vio a María. —Bebé, ¿necesitas algo? —preguntó Troy. —Solo quería saber si ibas a subir pronto —preguntó Gabriella poniendo su mano en su creciente barriga. —Estaré arriba en un minuto, ¿sí? —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Subió las escaleras y Troy escuchó la puerta cerrarse. María soltó una risita. —Eso no fue gracioso —dijo Troy. —Para mí sí —dijo María. Troy sacudió su cabeza y subió las escaleras. Abrió la puerta del cuarto de Gabriella y la vio tratando de ponerse cómoda en la cama. Gabriella abrió los ojos y suspiró. —La barriga me estorba —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —Déjame intentar —dijo Troy. Troy se acostó junto a Gabriella. Gabriella se recargó contra el cuerpo de Troy y sonrió. —¿Mejor? —preguntó Troy. —Mucho mejor —dijo Gabriella. La pareja se durmió. Un par de semanas después, Gabriella estaba en su casillero y vio a Taylor en el suyo. Cerró su casillero y caminó hacia Taylor. —Taylor, ¿podemos hablar? —preguntó Gabriella. —¿De que necesitas hablar? —preguntó Taylor. —Tay, eres mi mejor amiga. Sé que fue irresponsable tener sexo sin protección, pero pasó y quedé embarazada. Tienes que aceptarlo —dijo Gabriella. —Arruinaste tu futuro Gabriella. Todo por lo que trabajaste será nada porque ahora tienes un bebé que cuidar. No puedes salir del estado para ir a la escuela y no puedes ir a Stanford —dijo Taylor. —¿¡Crees que no lo sé, Tay!? Lo sé. Cada vez que me lega un correo, es de grandes universidades como Stanford o Yale. No tienes idea de lo enojada que estoy por eso —dijo Gabriella mientras empezaba a llorar. Troy vio a Gabriella alejarse de Taylor y desués caminó de largo sin hacerle caso. —¿Bebé? —le llamó Troy. Gabriella ignoró a Troy y siguió caminando. Troy apretó la mandíbula y tomó aire. Caminó hacia Taylor y la miró. —¿Qué le dijiste Tay? —preguntó Troy. —Solo le dije que perdió todo por lo que había trabajado, Troy. Porque es cierto —dijo Taylor. —¿Sabes?, eras su mejor amiga. Está embarazada y asustada, necesita una amiga y todo lo que puedes hacer es decirle cómo arruinó su vida. Supéralo Tay y no hables más con Gabriella —dijo Troy. Troy se alejó. Subió las escaleras hasta la terraza, el lugar favorito de Gabriella para pensar y que también era su lugar secreto que nadie aparte del club de ciencias conocía. Troy llegó a la terraza y vio a Gabriella sentada con su mano en la barriga y con lágrimas bajando por su acercóy se hincó frente a ella. —¿Estás bien, bebé? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella suspiró y limpió sus ojos. —Tiene razón —dijo Gabriella. —No, Brie. No está cerca de tener razón. Tay no sabe de lo que habla. Te mereces todo y más. Nos embarazamos… esas cosas pasan. Pero eso no significa que no seas buena estudiante o amiga. Entonces, tal vez no vayas a Stanford cuando ella vaya y está bien. Irás. Cuando sea el momento, haremos funcionar todo para que los dos vayamos a la escuela. No escuches a Taylor, bebé —dijo Troy. —¿Por qué siento como que soy una mala estudiante? —preguntó Gabriella. —Porque eres perfeccionista. Siempre tienes todo planeado para evitar cualquier tipo de procrastinación y esto no era parte de tu plan —dijo Troy. —Me doy vergüenza. Debimos asegurarnos que el condón no se rompería antes de hacer algo —dijo Gabriella. Troy pasó saliva pesadamente. —No debimos tener sexo esa noche. Debí haber estado estudiando para mi examen de química del siguiente día. Si hubiera estado estudiando, nada de esto habría pasado —dijo Gabriella. —Pero sí tuvimos sexo esa noche Brie. Todas las parejas tienen sexo. No eres mala persona por hacerlo —dijo Troy. —Me sedujiste con fresas cubiertas de chocolate —dijo Gabriella. —¿Es mi culpa? ¿por qué es mi culpa? —preguntó Troy poniendo una de sus manos en su pecho. —Sabías que querría tener sexo si hacías lo que hiciste —dijo Gabriella. Troy sacudió su cabeza, incrédulo. —Si no me hubieras seducido de la manera que sabes que me encanta, ahora no estaría embarazada —dijo Gabriella. Troy tomó aire y lo soltó. —Me voy a ir. ¡Tú fuiste la que quiso tener sexo Gabriella! —dijo Troy, levantando su voz. Gabriella miró a sus pies y su labio tembló. Troy lo vio e instantáneamente se sintió mal. —Bebé —comenzó Troy. —No, Troy. No —dijo Gabriella tratando de aguantar las lágrimas. Gabriella se levantó y se fue de la terraza. Troy tomó aire y lo soltó. Esa noche, Troy abrió la puerta frontal después de la práctica. María estaba sentada en la mesa de la cocina. —¿Te dijo lo que pasó? —preguntó Troy. —Solo partes —dijo María. —Mamá, te juro por mi vida, que así no fue como pasó —dijo Troy. —Lo sé, es muy difícil todo lo que ella está pasando. Va a culparte porque sabe que no es tu culpa —dijo María. —¿Sabes si está dormida? —preguntó Troy. —Creo que está haciendo tarea —dijo María. Troy asintió. Subió las escaleras y fue al cuarto de Gabriella. Troy suspiró cuando vio la puerta cerrada. Tocó respetuosamente la puerta. —Brie, por favor, ¿podemos hablar? —preguntó Troy a través de la puerta. —No quiero que te sientas seducido por mí —gritó Gabriella. Troy rodó los ojos. —Gabriella, abre la puerta —dijo Troy. Troy escuchó movimiento en el cuarto. Gabriella abrió la puerta y estaba cargando la bolsa de Troy. —Terminamos. Estoy harta de ti —dijo Gabriella. —¡Gabs! —dijo Troy. Gabriella le dio a Troy su bolsa. —Vete. Ahora —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella cerró la puerta antes de que Troy pudiera decir algo. Bajó las escaleras y miró a María. —Terminó conmigo —dijo Troy. María se quedó sin aliento. —Troy —María dijo. —Me voy a casa. Llámame si pasa algo, por favor —dijo Troy. —Lo haré —dijo María. —Y, ¿mamá? —preguntó Troy. —¿Sí, Troy? —preguntó María. —Dile que la amo a ella y a nuestra hija —dijo Troy. —¿Hija? ¿Tendrán una niña? —preguntó María emocionada. Troy miró a María. —Lo siento. Le diré. Te quiero Troy. Esto se le pasará, ya verás —dijo María. —Eso espero —dijo Troy. María besó la mejilla de Troy. —Te llamaré si pasa algo —dijo María. Troy asintió. Salió de la casa esperando que todo salga bien.'][Chapter 6] ['¡Hola! Les traigo un nuevo capítulo del Fanfic. En el capítulo pasado las cosas se pusieron un poco complicadas entre Troy y Gabriella. Veamos qué pasa en este capítulo. Una hora después, Gabriella bajó las escaleras. En sus mejillas había marcas de lágrimas y sus ojos estaban rojos por llorar. Entró a la cocina y tomó un plátano. María entró y miró a su hija. — ¿Se fue? —preguntó Gabriella. —Sí, le dijiste que lo hiciera, así que se fue. Gabriella, siéntate —dijo María, señalando el banco en la barra de la cocina. Gabriella se sentó junto a su madre. —Sé que los dos están estresados por todo. Pero pelear con Troy no lo arreglará. No vas a estar mágicamente desembarazada si intentas tener la razón de lo que pasó —dijo María. Gabriella parpadeó. —Es difícil mamá. Troy tuvo la oportunidad de tener futuro. Puede ir a la universidad si él quiere. Puede aceptar la beca. Tuvimos sexo y nuestros planes se destruyeron —dijo Gabriella. —No va aceptar la beca Gabriella, porque sabe que eso no es lo correcto para él, para ti y para su hija —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella vio a su madre con los ojos muy abiertos. —¡Lo voy a matar! ¡él te…! —comenzó Gabriella. —Se le salió Gabi. Relájate. Quiere estar cerca para criar a su hija contigo. Te ama con locura —dijo Gabriella. —Le dije que me sedujo —dijo Gabriella. María asintió. —No puedes culparlo. Es culpa de los dos —dijo María. Gabriella asintió y miró a su barriga. —¿Qué debo hacer? —preguntó Gabriella. —Ve y trata de hablar con él. Sabes que te escuchará Gabi —dijo María. Gabriella asintió y abrazó a su madre. María puso su mano en la cabeza de su hija y la besó suavemente. —Trae a mi hijo de vuelta —dijo María. Gabriella asintió. Se levantó y salió de la casa. Gabriella caminó a la casa Bolton y tocó el timbre. Lucille abrió la puerta y sonrió. —Mamá, cometí un error. ¿Dónde está Troy? —preguntó Gabriella. —Está arriba cariño, ¿cómo te sientes? —preguntó Lucille- —Un poco hormonal. Pero, fuera de eso, bien —dijo Gabriella. Gabriella subió las escaleras al cuarto de Troy y tocó la puerta. —No quiero hablar mamá —dijo Troy. Gabriella arió la puerta y miró a su novio. Troy miró a Gabriella. —Troy. Necesito disculparme. No debí culparte por nada, quedar embarazada fue culpa de los dos. No solo tuya. Solo estoy muy estresada con todo esto. Todo parece estar yendo mal. No quiero que terminemos —dijo Gabriella. Troy miró hacia sus manos. —Acepto tu disculpa y tampoco quiero terminar Gabs. Sé lo estresada que estás bebé. Sé que lo estás y yo también —dijo Troy. —Todo parece que está girando. Como dije, no quiero perderte Troy. No puedo perderte también. No cuando lo he perdido todo —dijo Gabriella. Troy le señaló a Gabriella que se sentara en su cama. Gabriella se sentó y miró a su novio. Abrió sus brazos y Gabriela entró en ellos y puso su cabeza en el pecho de Troy. La pareja se sentó en silencio por unos minutos. —Esto será difícil Brie. Pero te amo a ti y a nuestra hija. ¿Podemos olvidar esto? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. Troy se inclinó y besó los labios de Gabriella suave pero apasionadamente. Gabriella se alejó y recargó su frente en la de Troy. —Podría hacerte el amor ahora mismo, pero tu mamá me echaría —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió. —Te amo —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió y quitó un mechón de cabello de la cara de Gabriella. —Yo también te amo —dijo Troy. Un par de semanas después, Troy llegó tarde a casa por trabajo. Entró a la cocina y sonrió cuando vio a Gabriella cocinando con María. El cuerpo de Gabriella había cambiado mucho en las últimas semanas. Su barriga creció, sus pechos crecieron dos copas, sus pies comenzaban a doler y sus cambios de humor se hicieron evidentes. Troy caminó hacia Gabriella y la besó en la mejilla. —Hola bebé —dijo Troy. —Hola, ¿qué tal estuvo el trabajo? —preguntó Gabriella. —Ocupado. Todos decidieron tener problemas con su auto hoy —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió conciliadoramente. —¿Qué vamos a comer? —preguntó Troy. —Comeremos enchiladas —dijo Gabriella. —Mm —dijo Troy. —La bebé quiere comida mexicana —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió. —¿Necesitas que haga algo? —preguntó Troy. —Ve a bañarte, hueles a gas y aceite —dijo Gabriella. Los ojos de Troy se ensancharon. María comenzó a reír. —Su sentido del olfato es muy sensible —dijo María. Troy negó con la cabeza. —¿Me puedes dar un beso antes? —preguntó Troy. —Me vas a llenar de aceite —dijo Gabriella. Troy rápidamente dio un fugaz beso a los labios de Gabriella y subió las escaleras antes de que ella pudiera decir algo. Gabriella negó con la cabeza. —No sé qué haré con tu papi, bebé —dijo Gabriella. Veinte minutos después, Troy bajó las escaleras recién bañado y afeitado. Caminó hacia Gabriella. Gabriella miró a su novio. —¿Mejor? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella le señaló a Troy que se acercara. —Déjame oler —dijo Gabriella. Troy se acercó a Gabriella y abrió sus brazos para que pudiera olerlo. —Estás limpio —dijo Gabriella. Troy miró a María y después vio a la barriga de Gabriella. Se agachó y besó la barriga de Gabriella. —Bebita, estás volviendo loca a tu mami —dijo Troy. —Troy, ¿quieres un beso o no? —dijo Gabriella. Troy miró a Gabriella y sonrió. Se levantó y se inclinó para besar los labios de Gabriella. —Hola —dijo Troy. —Hola —dijo Gabriella. —¿Cómo te sientes? —preguntó Troy poniendo su mano en la barriga de Gabriella. —Bien. La espalda está empezando a dolerme —dijo Gabriella. —Deberías estar sentada Gabriella —dijo María. —Pero será más difícil cocinar si estoy sentada —dijo Gabriella. —Bebé, siéntate —dijo Troy. Gabriella suspiró, jaló una silla y se sentó. —Solo te estoy cuidando —dijo Troy. —Lo sé. Son muchas reglas, solo tengo dieciséis —dijo Gabriella. —¿Y de quién es la culpa que estés embarazada a los dieciséis? —preguntó María. La pareja bajó la mirada. —No deberías estar embarazada —dijo María. —¿Quieres que tome tu lugar para que vayas a descansar? —preguntó Troy. —Está bien —dijo Gabriella. Troy sonrió y besó suavemente la mejilla de Gabriella. Esa noche, Gabriella estaba dando vueltas en la cama. Finalmente se levantó y bajó las escaleras. Fue a la cocina, abrió el refrigerador y sonrió. Empezó a sacar ingredientes para crear una botana de media noche. Arriba, Troy se despertó y vio que Gabriella ya no estaba en la cama. Se levantó, salió del cuarto y vio la luz del baño apagada. Troy bajó las escaleras con esperanza de encontrar a Gabriella. Entró a la cocina y sonrió cuando vio a su novia dándole los toques finales a su botana. —¿Qué haces despierta tan tarde? —preguntó Troy. —No podía dormir. La barriga me estorbaba y no podía ponerme cómoda —dijo Gabriella. —¿Por qué no me despertaste? —preguntó Troy. —Tienes un turno largo en el trabajo mañana, y no quería despertarte —dijo Gabriella. —No debes preocuparte bebé. ¿Qué estás haciendo? —preguntó Troy. —Tenía antojo de algo, así que básicamente junté todo lo que pude encontrar que se viera bien —dijo Gabriella. —¿Antojos? Pensé que eso no pasaría sino hasta después —dijo Troy. —Pueden pasar en cualquier momento —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. Gabriella terminó de hacer su botana y la puso en un plato. Se sentó a la mesa y comenzó a comer. Troy tuvo una idea, tomó un plato y una cuchara y se sirvió un poco del plato de Gabriella. —¿Qué estás haciendo? —preguntó Gabriella. —Bueno, dije que pasaríamos juntos todo el embarazo, ¿verdad? Si lo vamos a hacer, quiero probar esta interesante botana que hiciste —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió. Troy le devolvió la sonrisa y le guiñó el ojo. —Sabe muy bien —dijo Gabriella. Troy tomó un poco de su comida y masticó cuidadosamente tratando de evitar escupirlo. Lo tragó y miró a Gabriella. —¿Tan mal sabe? —preguntó Gabriella. —No bebé. Fue… fue… tenía algunas texturas buenas —dijo Troy. —¿Texturas? —preguntó Gabriella. —Muchos diferentes tipos de comida en una sola. Fue un sabor único —dijo Troy, tratando de hacer que Gabriella sintiera que su antojo era normal. —Troy, no te gustó. Admítelo —dijo Gabriella. —Con toda honestidad, es muy malo bebé, Pero, si te gusta y hace feliz a la bebita entonces sigue haciéndolo —dijo Troy. Gabriella soltó una risita. Terminó de comer y puso su plato en el lavabo. Gabriella caminó hacia Troy y lo abrazó. —Gracias por apoyarme en todo —dijo Gabriella inclinándose y besando los labios de Troy. Troy sonrió. —Solo prométeme que tu siguiente antojo sea una hamburguesa o algo así. Eso lo comeré feliz —dijo Troy. —Veré qué puedo hacer —dijo Gabriella. —¿Te sientes bien aparte de todo? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. Troy puso su mano en el estómago de Gabriella. —Vamos, necesitamos dormir. Tenemos escuela mañana —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Troy tomó la mano de Gabriella y la pareja subió las escaleras al cuarto de Gabriella para dormir. Un par de semanas después, Gabriella tenía cuatro meses de embarazo. Las náuseas matutinas se detuvieron y la pareja estaba muy feliz por eso. Gabriella seguía en la escuela y más ocupada que nunca. Un día, Troy estaba en la práctica de básquetbol haciendo jugadas para un juego próximo. Alguien de la oficina de enfrente entró al gimnasio y apartó a Jack. Un par de minutos después, Jack sopló su silbato. —Troy —dijo Jack. Troy miró a su padre y supo que algo estaba mal. —¿Qué pasó?, ¿en dónde está? —dijo Troy, acercándose a su padre. —En la enfermería. No me dijeron qué pasó —dijo Jack. Troy asintió. Salió del gimnasio y fue a la enfermería. Troy vio a Gabriella acostada en una cama con una cobija encima. Caminó hacia ella y se sentó en el filo de la cama. —¿Qué pasó bebé? —preguntó Troy preocupado. —Me deshidraté y casi me desmayé —dijo Gabriella. Troy soltó un suspiro de alivio. —¿Ahora está bien? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Necesita descansar. Ha estado corriendo y tratando de de tener todo listo para el club de química. Ahí es cuando todo empezó —dijo la enfermera. Troy asintió. —Especialmente ahora que está embarazada, no debería estar haciendo esto. Necesita relajarse —dijo la enfermera. —Estoy de acuerdo. ¿Puedo llevarla a casa? —preguntó Troy. —Claro —dijo la enfermera. Troy y Gabriella salieron de la enfermería y se subieron al auto. La pareja regresó en silencio hasta que Gabriella habló. —Lo siento —dijo Gabriella. Troy tomó aire y lo soltó. —Bebé, necesitas empezar a cuidarte. Necesitas asegurarte de comer a tus horas. Necesitas tomar más agua de lo que acostumbras. Y, no deberías estresarte sobre cosas como el club de química. Llevas a nuestra hija, Brie —dijo Troy. Gabriella tenía lágrimas bajando por su rostro. —Lo siento. No pensé que estuviera haciendo tanto —chilló Gabriella. Troy puso su mano en el muslo de Gabriella. —No estoy enojado bebé. Solo estoy preocupado. Que me llamen en medio de la práctica porque estás en la enfermería no es algo que quiera volver a escuchar —dijo Troy. —Lo siento —repitió Gabriella. —Solo, sé más cuidadosa, ¿sí? —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintió. Llegaron a casa de Gabriella y bajaron del auto. —Brie —dijo Troy. Gabriella miró a su novio. Troy se acercó y besó sus labios. —Te amo —dijo Troy. —Yo también te amo —dijo Gabriella. —Prométeme que serás más cuidadosa —dijo Troy. —Lo prometo —dijo Gabriella. La pareja entró a la casa y Troy se congeló cuando vio a sus padres sentados en el sofá con María. —Hola Troy —dijo Lucille. —Hola mamá —dijo Troy. —Troy, espero que esté bien que hay invitado a tus padres —dijo María. —Sí, está bien —dijo Troy. —Gabriella, ¿cómo te sientes? —preguntó Lucille. —Bien, un poco cansada, pero bien —dijo Gabriella. —De hecho, Brie va a dormir un poco —dijo Troy. Gabriella asintó. Troy besó suavemente los labios de Gabriella. Ella subió las escaleras y Troy la siguió con la mirada hasta que escuchó la puerta cerrarse. Después miró a sus padres. —¿Qué está pasando? —preguntó Troy. —Queremos saber qué plan tienes acerca de Gabriella y la bebé —dijo Lucille. —Brie y nuestra hija estarán conmigo —dijo Troy. María sonrió. —Lo entendemos Troy. Pero, ¿dónde? ¿Cómo vas a hacerlo? —preguntó María. —Hablamos sobre eso. Gabriella quiere que vaya a la escuela y tome la beca. Ella va a estar con nuestra hija hasta que yo acabe y después cambiaremos lugares —dijo Troy. —¿Qué hay del trabajo? —preguntó Jack. —No hemos hablado de eso. Tuvimos algunos accidentes —dijo Troy. —¿Accidentes? —preguntó María. —Me sacaron de la práctica hoy porque Brie estaba deshidratada y casi se desmayó en el club de química —dijo Troy. —¿Por eso está arriba? —confirmó María. Troy asintió. —Se está estresando mucho y eso no es bueno para la bebé. Está corriendo por todos lados y no debería hacerlo —dijo Troy. María y Lucille asintieron. —No hemos podido hablar mucho sobre trabajo aún por todo lo que ha pasado. Estoy ganando una cantidad decente en la tienda —dijo Troy. —¿Y qué pasará cuando nazca la bebé Troy? —preguntó Lucille. —Los dos tendremos trabajo —dijo Troy. —¿Dónde van a vivir? —preguntó Jack. —Cuando hayamos ahorrado lo suficiente, encontraremos un departamento. Pero, cuando la bebé recién nazca, estoy seguro que Brie va a querer estar aquí para que María pueda ayudarla —dijo Troy. María asintió. —Y quiero asegurarme de que los dos puedan encargarse de la bebé —dijo María. Troy asintió. —¿Quiénes estarán en la sala de parto con ella? —preguntó Lucille. —Muy bien, alto. Si van a venir a preguntar cosas está bien. Pero, los dos estamos estresados. Aún estamos intentando averiguar muchas cosas. Así que, por favor, dennos tiempo para hacerlo —dijo Troy. Lucille asintió. —Solo queríamos… —comenzó Lucille. —Sé que solo quieren ayudar. Pero Brie está estresada. Entre la escuela, nuestros amigos, el trabajo, nuestra relación y el embarazo… son muchas cosas. Aún estamos intentando acostumbrarnos a esto —dijo Troy. Los tres padres asintieron. —Subiré para ver cómo está —dijo Troy. Troy subió las escaleras y fue al cuarto. Gabriella estaba sentada viendo a su novio. —¿Lo escuchaste? —preguntó Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Bebé —comenzó Troy. —Necesito bajar —dijo Gabriella levantándose de la cama. Gabriella bajó y vio a los tres adultos hablando. —Troy y mi madre estarán conmigo en la sala de partos —dijo Gabriella. —Cariño, sabes que solo intentamos arreglar todo esto. Nadie está enojado o tratando de decir qué deben o no deben hacer. Pero, necesitamos averiguar qué pasará cuando la bebé nazca —dijo Lucille. —Lo sé. Solo que soy muy nueva en todo esto y no sé qué está pasando. Cada día pasa algo nuevo —dijo Gabriella. Troy asintió. —Quiero que Troy, la bebé y yo estemos en la misma casa cuando ella nazca. No quiero que tenga que estar de casa en casa. Eso no es estabilidad. Necesitará estabilidad y yo haré lo que tenga en mi poder para darle eso —dijo Gabriella. —Cariño, tendrás diecisiete años. No vas a… —comenzó María. —¿Quieres que mi hija esté en un hogar roto? No lo permitiré —dijo Gabriella. —Gabs… —Troy comenzó, pero fue interrumpido. —No Troy. Si vamos a tener una bebé, necesitamos actuar como si fuéramos adultos casados. La gente que tiene bebés viven en la misma casa. Así que, eso es lo que quiero. Pueden aceptar o no. Pero eso es lo que quiero y es lo que va a pasar —dijo Gabriella. Hubo silencio por un momento. Troy fue el primero en hablar. —Estoy de acuerdo. Si vamos a tener esta bebé, debemos hacerlo bien —dijo Troy. Gabriella sonrió. La pareja y sus padres intentaron hacer un plan para cuando naciera la bebé por el resto del día.']","Summary":" ['¡Hola!, con la novedad de que en Netflix publicaron las dos primeras entregas de High School Musi"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"Dusk 'Til Dawn","Author":"zacefronlvr14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13120573","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['It wasn\\'t supposed to be like this. He was so young. ...So kind, and innocent. I couldn\\'t help but feel an overwhelming guilt, but I was sure that was nothing compared to what Troy is probably feeling. I looked over to my best friend and came across the look of distance and devastation marked on his features. His little brother had died in a car accident, in which Troy had been driving. Troy was lurched over his little brother\\'s grave. Here lays Samuel Bolton. Son. Brother. Friend. \"Troy, honey, it\\'s time to go.\" Troy\\'s mom, Lucille, said putting her hand on his shoulder and bending down to his figure. \"No.\" He whispered. \"Baby, please-\" \"No mom. Go.\" His features darkened and his voice became fierce. He didn\\'t want to leave Sam, but it was already too late. \"Troy Bolton, we need to go. You need to go home and rest. You\\'re sick honey.\" Lucille said, helplessly. She reached next to Troy\\'s ear. \"Troy please, I can\\'t lose another son. Please, I need you to come with me.\" Troy turned around to face his mom and my heart broke. He had tears running down his face. Never have I seen Troy cry. Vulnerable was never in Troy\\'s character, but it seemed to be the only feeling inside of him. It wasn\\'t long after that Troy broke down in his mother\\'s arms, cuddling against her side and buried his face into her hair. \"I\\'m sorry Mama, I-I\\'m so sorry, it\\'s all my fault. I did this.\" He sobbed. If the whole situation didn\\'t tear me apart, then Troy\\'s cry had ripped me to two, instantly. All his mother did was shake her head and kiss the top of his head repeatedly, with tears running down her face. Troy hadn\\'t been the one to tell me, it was my mom who found out from Troy\\'s. I tried calling Troy after I heard, repeatedly, but his phone was shut off. How could I make him feel better? I needed to make my best friend better. Troy\\'s mom and his uncle had managed to get Troy off the ground and into the car where they drove off. I didn\\'t get a chance to say anything, and even if I did, I wouldn\\'t know what to say. \"We should go to, Shar.\" my mother had chided in, disrupting my many emotions and thoughts. \"Where?\" I asked in a small voice. \"We\\'ll go see Troy and Lucille honey, after we freshen up. I promise.\" I think my mom could sense how much of a need I had to be with Troy. \"O-okay.\"'][Chapter 2] ['By the time my mom and I headed over to Troy\\'s house, everyone but his mom, uncle and aunt had left. It seemed as if Troy had left to. I couldn\\'t catch sight of him in the living room. \"Hi Lucy.\" I said in a small voice. She smiled warmly at me and hugged me tightly. How can she be so kind and comforting to me, after she had just suffered from the greatest loss a mother could have. Her own son being taken away. \"He\\'s in the tree house. Can you go check up on him, for me?\" She asked in a low voice. All I could do was nod. When I made it to his backyard, I looked around and then finally up. We haven\\'t been up into the treehouse since we were 12. Troy had always said he was too old for it, but how he didn\\'t want to take it down, just for memories sake. That\\'s when it hit me that Sam loved playing in the treehouse. In fact, I\\'m pretty sure he claimed it as his own once he got the okay from Troy. His big brother who he looked up to, greatly. He\\'d been so excited that day, the fact that he was having something of Troy\\'s. I swallowed the lump that had rose in the back of my throat, and climbed up the ladder into the treehouse. I found Troy huddled up in the corner with a cigarette in his mouth. My heart clenched at the sight of literal death on a stick. My father had been a heavy smoker, which inevitably lead to his untimely demise due to lung cancer. He never stopped and that broke me. He couldn\\'t stop for his own family. His own daughter. Troy knew I resented my father for it, even beyond his grave. \"Why are you here?\" Troy\\'s voice broke through the raging discomfort I had. He must have heard me come up, but he didn\\'t turn around. \"H-how\\'d you know it was me.\" \"Because I know you.\" \"Oh, well, um I just came up to check up on you.\" I crawled closer to him. He still wouldn\\'t look at me. \"Troy?\" He let out a soft sigh. \"Leave, Sharpay.\" \"Troy-\" \"Are you fucking deaf? Do I have to repeat myself?\" He said through his clenched teeth, looking down at his cigarette. I was standing my ground. \"I\\'m not going to leave you alone, Troy. You need someone, and I\\'m here. I\\'m not going anywhere.\" \"Well, I want you to damnit.\" It was then when he finally looked into my eyes. Where once were kind, whimsical eyes were now replaced by a cold and distant navy blue. \"I don\\'t want you here, Sharpay. Not in his treehouse.\" I tried to get words out, but nothing came out, as my gaze was kept on the cigarette between his brittle fingers. He seemed to have caught on to where I was looking before he let out a scoff. \"Grow up for god\\'s sake Sharpay.\" \"Troy, what-\" \"What Sharpay? Does it piss you off that I have this? Does it remind you of how poor old daddy died?\" He said, gesturing to the cigarette, letting out a small, ridiculing laugh. My silence was his answer. \"Since when did you start smoking?\" He scoffed, \"You just never knew.\" My silence fell in the way of my shock. I had never heart Troy talk like this in our past 10 years of friendship. He wasn\\'t even making sense. I know under the circumstances of what happened, I expected Troy to be...not okay, but I didn\\'t expect this. I hoped he would let me in and help him with whatever he needed, like he usually did. \"Troy, I know you\\'re hurting. Please just tell me what you need so I can help you feel better?\" \"If I knew I was talking to a brick wall, I wouldn\\'t have even have wasted my breath. I told you, Sharpay. Leave. Now.\" His voice grew louder, which was starting to scare me. But I couldn\\'t just leave him. \"Troy please-\" I said putting my hand on his cheek softly. That was a mistake. Troy let out a low growl and grabbed my arm, twisting it away from him. \"Troy!\" \"Why is it so difficult for you to understand huh?\" \"Stop, stop!\" I cried, noticing that the cigarette was close to my skin. \"Stop what Sharpay? I just lost my brother. If you really want to help me, fucking don\\'t talk to me, don\\'t look at me. Leave. \"Why are you acting like this?\" I said through my tears looking up into his emotionless eyes, trying to search for an answer. I let out a scream followed by a sob, when the burnt ashes had fallen from the cigarette onto my skin. \"Troy, please let me go, please, you\\'re hurting me. I\\'m sorry, please let me go.\" Those words seemed to have shocked Troy since he let go of me and pulled away from me completely and dashed to the other side of the tree house. I clutched my arm close to my body. It fucking hurts. I couldn\\'t look at him. \"L-leave Sharpay. I mean it, go and don\\'t come back. I don\\'t want you near me. Go.\" He said as if he was disgusted. \"W-what did I do wrong Troy?\" He responded with a deadly glare that sent me running back home.'][Chapter 3] ['December 22, 2009 Winter vacation. \"Here are the last of your bags, baby. I\\'ll let you get settled in.\" My mom helped me to bring the last couple of suitcases I had for my December and January stay back in Albuquerque. \"Thanks Ma.\" I let out a small laugh and smiled appreciatively at my mom. She really did have the best interest at heart for me and I was happy she was finally happy. I guess I should fill you in since my last abrupt update. For starters, it\\'s always been my mom and I for awhile, until recently. My mom was a social worker and had quote on quote fallen in love with her co-worker, Danny. Honestly, I\\'m happy my mom had Danny when I left for college. He\\'s a good guy who has a good heart and I can tell that my mom is one of the lights of his life. \"PAYYYYY!\" A little body collided with mine, while I was turned around. I let out a groan and picked up that little body, my stepsister, Ari. Danny\\'s 9 year old daughter, the main light of his life, and mine too, I have to say. \"Hey trouble.\" I smirked and kissed her forehead. \"Ugh, about time you came. Someone can finally watch Disney channel with me. Dad says he\\'s too old for it.\" \"Psh, don\\'t listen to him, no one is too old for Disney right?\" I kissed her head again before setting her down. She quickly went to sit up on my bed and picked up paint samples that I had brought in. \"So we\\'re going for a forest-green color for your walls amiright?\" Ari flipped through the many samples in a deep focus. This girl may be 9 but she\\'s a lot more knowledgible that she lets on. Let\\'s just say 9 year old me would be jealous of her. I let out a sigh I\\'ve been holding in for the entire day and plopped onto the bed next to her. \"Right you are.\" Coming home was always a complicated circumstance for me. I went to school in San Francisco, so coming back home while I was dying during finals seemed to be the only thing to look forward to, but I always felt indifferent when I actually came home. As melodramatic as this sounds. Home wasn\\'t home to me anymore. Home reminded me of Troy, and well, Troy wasn\\'t a part of my life anymore. A person would think that two years away from someone who broke your heart would be enough time. Well not for me. And it sucks, like really fricken sucks. I hadn\\'t seen him since our last encounter in which he basically told me to piss off and never talk to him again. To say I\\'ve asked myself why everyday would be an understatement. I never knew what I did to him for him to say all those to me, and it ate me up to my core. He was so important to me, and if I\\'m being honest, he still is. But I need to realize things are different now, and it\\'s time I really do my best to move on. Maybe changing my scenery at home can be a start. \"Are you sure it\\'s not too dark? What about a gray?\" Ari suggested. \"I-\" \"Sharpay! Ari! Dinner is ready!\" my mom informed us. \"We,\" I said taking the paint sample out of her little hands and setting them on my dresser. \"Shall pick this up later. Let\\'s go eat.\" \"Kay-Kay!\" Ari raced to the bottom of the stairs. Even if me and Ari weren\\'t related by blood, we both had one thing in common. We\\'ll never say no to food. I got ready to follow behind her when a flicker of light caught my attention. Troy\\'s window. My heart leaped and before I knew it, I was rushing down the stairs. I couldn\\'t handle seeing him right now, I would start thinking about him again. And I really don\\'t want that, but too late.'][Chapter 4] ['My mom and I were clearing up the kitchen after everyone was done eating. \"So Pay, I\\'ve been dying to ask you something…\" \"Oh no, I\\'m scared.\" I said letting out a chuckle. She put her hip on the island, leaning against it. \"Do you ever think about talking to Troy again?\" I froze and my heart skipped a beat. I was not expecting her to ask me something like that. She was aware of our history after Sam died. \"Um actually, I don\\'t.\" I whispered. \"Why not?\" mom asked me curiously. I turned around to face my mom, but instead of looking at her, I just looked at feet. \"Mom you know everything that happened between us. I haven\\'t talked to him in 3 months, I highly doubt he would want to see me.\" I said in a low voice. It didn\\'t help that I hadn\\'t thought about Troy at all this dinner compared to the rest of the day where I couldn\\'t even stop thinking about him. \"Honey, he\\'s changed. I don\\'t know if you heard but he went through even more after you left. He…\" \"No mom, I don\\'t want to hear it. If you\\'ll excuse me, I think everything here is clean. I\\'m going to my room.\" I stated strongly, before I hurried up the the stairs into my room and plopped onto my bed. I looked up to the ceiling and tears started to fall from my eyes. Dammit. I hated how just even Troy\\'s name brings out emotions that I\\'ve worked on barricading for the past three years. I haven\\'t been able to feel anything from any other guys. Just Troy. Yknow what hurts the most is that beyond my feelings for him, I miss my best friend. He was always so protective and caring towards me and he always knew what to do and say to make me laugh. God, I missed him. All these thoughts led me to crying all curled up in an emotional shit ball. It wasn\\'t until I felt someone tapping on my shoulder that I opened up my eyes and looked up to see Ari. \"Can I sleep with you Pay? I missed you.\" I sniffled before I picked her little body up. \"Of course, baby.\" When she was settled into the bed, she immediately cuddled up to me. Gosh, my little sister never knew how much comfort she brings to me. I\\'m truly blessed to have her in my life. It was silent for several minutes, until I saw she had fallen asleep. I carefully got up to wash my face and rinse off before settling back into the warm comforter. Ari instinctively cuddled into me again but not before she whispered, \"I know you still love Troy, Pay. It\\'s okay because he still loves you too.\"'][Chapter 5] ['I woke up the next morning feeling a but disoriented and looked over to the weight on my arm and say Ari still sleeping. What she said to me the night before came rushing back. \"It\\'s okay because he still loves you too.\" How would she even know that? I put a hand through my hair before I got up to freshen up. A number of questions and thoughts were running through my mind as I was getting ready. How would Ari even know that? Wait, what is it exactly that Ari knows between me and Troy? Because I sure as hell have dodged the idea of him and his name with every opportunity that was thrown my way. Most of all, I doubt that Troy loves me. After our last encounter and failure to keep in touch over the years, again, I highly doubt it, and it\\'s kind of easier to turn the idea down. It pushes me to stop thinking about him. One of the places I wanted to revisit was my favorite Barnes and Noble bookstore. I can truly say that place is my safe haven. I love looking through all the books and supplies there. Most of all, I love going there when it\\'s empty and sitting in the cafe while doing some of my work. It\\'s peaceful and it gives me some sort of contentment. I don\\'t share this place with anyone I know, it\\'s mine. I traveled downstairs to grab an orange before I headed out to see Ari all ready to go to school. \"Okay, I\\'m gonna head out, I will see you guys later.\" I went over to kiss Ari\\'s head, while grabbing my backpack, and leaned my head against my mom\\'s shoulder and smiled up to her. \"Bye honey!\" \"Bye Pay!\" I opened the door to see None other than Troy. Holy shit. I was frozen for a little while, as was he. He still had the same sandy brown hair, but was combed out and he definitely had bulked up. I mean not too much, but he wasn\\'t exactly a noodle anymore. He seemed to take me in. Both our mouths were agape, not really knowing what to say or do. Months and months after not being in contact and so much...just physically..has changed. I somehow managed to break the ice. I managed to ask, \"W-What are you doing h-here?\" \"Uh-\" He looked nervous as hell as he rubbed the back of his neck and avoided eye contact with me. Ouch. But what was I expecting? A greeting hug? \"I\\'m here to pick up Ariana.\" \"Why.\" I asked a lot sharper than I intended to. \"I-I always drop her off at school before I go to work.\" What? \"TROOYYYY!\" Ari came crashing onto Troy\\'s leg, shoving me out of the way. Troy stumbled a little from the force and smiled down at Ari. \"Hey Ari.\" Troy smiled. \"Oh-uh-okay.\" I side stepped them and climbed into my car, wanting to leave before Troy did. Why did I feel like my kid sister had betrayed me? She looked so excited to see Troy, and vise versa. How much has happened since I left? All I was left feeling was stunned. I hate that Troy had that power over me. \"Hey kiddo!\" I let out a little chuckle before going over to hug one of my favorite people. \"Hey Mr. Guzman, how are ya?\" Mr. Guzman is one of the OG workers at this Barnes and Noble. He\\'s pretty much the supervisor and you see him jumping from station to station. He was either working at the cafe one day or he was checking out books and placing them on shelves while eating mini-pretzels. \"Good. Tired. Fat.\" He mumbled. I just shook my head and smiled to myself. \"How about you?\" \"I\\'m good, I\\'m back for break-\" \"Ooh, speaking of, Cam, my break is now, get your attractive slf up to the floor and get me some customers. \"Coming boss!\" Cam? I turn around to see a 6\\'2\\'\\' hunk. Tall and lanky and beautiful. Hazel eyes and hair and I\\'m kind of speechless. He definitely got my attention. \"Oh Cameron, this is Sharpay! A regular, when she\\'s home anyway and my favorite customer! Make her a drink on the house.\" He whispers the last part before disappearing into the break room. He peeks out again. \"Come in here after you get your drink, I have some chisme.\" I look back at Mr. Tall and Handsome and flash him the best smile I can. \"Uh-hi. I\\'m Sharpay.\" I said quietly enough for him to hear while extending my arm for a handshake. \"Hey, I\\'m Cameron, you can call me Cam.\" He said taking my hand, shaking it, flashing a million dollar smile. Oh my god. \"Here let me go make your drink. Guzman seems pretty excited to see you.\" \"Oh yeah, sure.\" I chuckled nervously, putting a piece of my hair behind my ear. \"And what would you like m\\'lady?\" \"Mango Sunrise with honey please.\" Honey. After grabbing my drink and saying thank you, I go into the back room where I see Guzman eating his lunch that he grabbed from the cafe. \"Ah-sit down-sit down.\" He said patting the seat next to him. \"So, what\\'s this gossip you need to share with me.\" \"Well maybe I should ask you first. How\\'s Troy-boy?\" he said mockingly I choke on my drink. \"Troy-what?\" He rolls his eyes. \"Troy. How are you two?\" I glare at him. \"You already know.\" The next day after Troy and I\\'s argument, I came to Guzman crying. He knew how much I cared about Troy and well if I\\'m being honest, Guzman was one of the closest things I had to a dad, and I didn\\'t know who else to go to. I sobbed my eyes out in the backroom while him and his wife listened and comforted me, bringing me my favorite drink and letting me calm myself down. Guzman and his wife were really there for me. Guzman\\'s wife is currently sick. She has the big C, which makes me hate cancer even more. It always robs the people I care about the most. My dad and now her. \"Hm, well, do you know what\\'s been new with him?\" \"Besides the fact that he\\'s apparently taking my little sister to school everyday and me running into him again for the first time in months...nope. And I\\'d like to leave it that way.\" \"Aiya, you\\'re such a bad liar. Of course you want to know what happened to him\" He dramatically sighs. \"Honestly, it\\'s better off that I don\\'t.\" I smile sadly, but he seemed to understand. \"He\\'ll tell you. Trust.\" I look up from my drink confused. \"What do you m-...? My phone lets out an obnoxious ring indicating I got a text. I read it over quickly and sigh. \"I\\'m sorry Mr. Guz, I have to go pick up some stuff for my mom before I head home.\" \"No worries mi hija. I\\'ll see you later. I mean if you don\\'t want Troy anymore, I heard Cameron is single. At least come back for him\" I let out a hearty laugh. \"I will! But not for the reason you\\'re thinking! Send Mrs. Guzman my love!\" \"I will. And Sharpay!\" \"Yeah?\" \"He\\'ll come around.\" I think he was referring to Troy. What? Has Troy got the whole town wired? I solemnly nod and make my exit to my car.'][Chapter 6] ['\"So when were you planning on telling me that Troy is involved with Ari?\" I asked my mom, throwing the keys onto the black island. \"Involved?\" I scoffed. \"You know what I mean mom.\" \"Look, it really isn\\'t that big of a deal Sharpay. I got busy around morning time and it just so happens that Troy\\'s work passes by Ari\\'s school in the morning. He offered. I said yes. And thank god for that.\" Mom responded curtly. \"He offered?\" \"Sharpay.\" Okay maybe I wasn\\'t making it easy for my mom with all these acussing sounding questions. However, I just don\\'t understand how Troy is so wrapped up in our lives again since I left, and I just had no idea until I saw him standing outside my house. I sighed. \"I\\'m sorry, it\\'s just-I-I don\\'t know.\" I really didn\\'t/ \"Talk to me honey.\" Mom begged. \"I don\\'t even know what I\\'m supposed to say. He\\'s changed, he looks different.\" I miss him is what I really wanted to say. \"I mean you haven\\'t seen him in quite a while, it was bound to happen.\" She said, grabbing and holding my hand. \"Yeah, I guess.\" All of a sudden I just wanted to burst into tears. \"I miss him mom, I miss my best friend.\" \"Oh, honey.\" Mom came and wrapped her arms around me while I clung onto her crying onto her shoulder. \"I thought it\\'d stop hurting mom, I just want it to stop.\" I managed to say before sobs took over me again. I heard mom gasp softly and pulled away to look at her. \"Mom, what?\" Her eyes were facing behind my shoulder, so I turned to what she was gaping at. Troy. And Ari. \"Hi, sweetheart\" Mom wiped away a tear and sniffled. She was crying too? \"What are you doing here?\" \"Oh, um I just wanted to walk Ari inside so I knew she would get inside safely.\" \"Yeah! Troy\\'s superman! He\\'s my protector.\" Ari hugged Troy\\'s neck as he was giving her a piggyback inside. I could tell how much Ari looked up to Troy. Like he really was her protector, her big brother that she always wanted, like he hung the stars in the sky. Troy just smiled at her. Mom let out a laugh before taking Ari off of Troy\\'s back. \"Um, me and Ari will leave you two...to catch up.\" Well that was the last thing I wanted. \"Bye, Ari.\" Troy whispered quietly towards Ari with a smile. \"Bye!\" Ari said swiftly before running towards the kitchen. Mom gave me a look before she followed Ari. Please, listen to him. I couldn\\'t even grow the courage to look at him and neither could he with me. We stayed silent for a while while the night continued to carry on. Seconds felt like eternity before he decided to break the silence. \"Hey.\" Troy voiced it as if he spoke any higher that I would crack. I nodded curtly, still not look at him but actually turned away from him. I could feel his eyes boring into the back of my head. \"How are you?\" I scoffed totally disregarding the awkwardness. \"How are you? That\\'s what you\\'re going to ask me after how long.\" Months after not talking and shutting me out he somehow decides he has the audacity to ask me how I am? \"Shar-\" He sighed. That hit a chord. I hadn\\'t heard him say my nickname in that long. I turned around finally growing the balls to shoot daggers at him with my eyes. \"Don\\'t even fucking call me that.\" I spat. He swallowed. \"I\\'m sorry.\" \"Whatever.\" I walked past him. I couldn\\'t deal. \"You know Sharpay, you can\\'t keep running away from me.\" Troy said in a stern tone. \"Excuse me?\" I said incredulously turning around to face him. \"You pretending like I don\\'t exist and your efforts at dodging me aren\\'t necessary or much less working.\" This fired me up. \"Remind me again Troy, who said to me that I needed to leave you alone and never acknowledge you again? Oh right,\" I chucked with no humor. \"It was you. So, forgive me for doing what you asked me to do.\" \"Sharpay, that-look, I know what I said, and I\\'m sorry Sharpay, I really am. I was in a bad mindset and I know I said and did some pretty terrible things to you, but don\\'t you want to leave the past behind? To let this go and move on?\" Since when did Troy get all high and mighty with his apologies. \"What? Did your therapist write that apology out for you?\" Okay, that was a low blow. I had heard from some source that Troy was forced to see a therapist after he did some damage. On what? I don\\'t know and neither do I want to. Now, Troy was set off. \"Listen,\" he hissed. \"I\\'m trying like hell to move on, Sharpay. I\\'ve pretty much figured and forgiven myself for a majority of my fuck ups, except with what happened with us.\" \"Yeah, well that\\'s not my problem.\" \"I know this has sucked for you too, Sharpay so don\\'t try to act all tough and heartless. Not with me. Both of our families have given me an earful of what happened with our fallout. Plus, if you honestly think that I haven\\'t felt like shit for the past couple of months, then that just shows how much you know me.\" \"That\\'s the thing Troy, I don\\'t fucking know you! I don\\'t want to anymore. You fucked me up, Troy. You did one of the worst things you could have ever done to me and pushed me away from one of the only people who made me feel safe. And look, I\\'m sorry that Sam died, okay? But I can tell you he\\'d be pretty disappointed in the person you became.\" Shit. I said the words before I could stop them from spilling. \"Don\\'t you dare bring up Sam\\'s name like that again, Sharpay.\" Troy said through clenched teeth. I crossed a line. I fucked up. \"T-Troy, I\\'m sorry.\" \"Don\\'t pretend like you know me Sharpay, especially off our last arrangement. But I\\'m different. I went through some pretty fucked up shit when you left. You\\'re mad, yeah? I get it. You\\'re pissed. But the longer you have your head up your ass about not wanting to make things right. Well, then that\\'s on you.\" He all but said this under his breath. I should have been yelled at. I deserved it. I preferred it. Because the way Troy was saying this now, broke me all over again. \"You can\\'t run from me forever. That\\'s not how we work.\" \"There is no we, anymore Troy.\" I could see that Troy was obviously tired from putting up and looking for a fight. \"Yeah well, we promised long before that we were going to be friends for a long time.\" \"That was before you abandoned me!\" I yelled. Tears of frustration ran down my face. I felt like I couldn\\'t breathe anymore. \"That was before you left me.\" I bit out harshly knocking his shoulder before going inside and locking myself in my room. I didn\\'t even see his reaction. Did I make things worse? Probably. Did I care? I regretted it so much, but it just hurt too much. What was going to happen now?'][Chapter 7] ['I heard pretty obnoxious knocks on my door. I just continued looking at the door, waiting for it to stop. It didn\\'t, if anything it grew louder. \"WHAT?\" \"Sharpay, I\\'m sorry, but please let me explain.\" Troy was wide-eyed and puffing when I opened the door. He seemed to be pretty surprised that I opened it. \"There\\'s nothing to explain. I get it.\" I tried closing the door but he managed to slide himself in while I tried to push it close. C\\'mon. \"Sharpay, I didn\\'t abandon you. That was not my intention.\" He puffed standing across me and panting. Why the hell are you puffing? Calm down. \"Are you sure about that, because that\\'s what it seemed like.\" Maybe I was being relentless, but I didn\\'t care. \"I didn\\'t know what I needed, but I knew enought to be able to understand that I was in a really bad headspace. I knew that I was capable of hurting someone...and I did. \"Damn straight, now please if you would so kindly leave.\" I smirked pointing towards the door \"Sharapy, please, I\\'m trying here.\" Troy said exasperated. I had to give it to him, I wasn\\'t making things any easier on him, and I was denying him any relief, but I was mad. He really fucked me over \"I-I know. But you don\\'t understand how much you hurt me Troy.\" \"Then tell me Sharapy, I want to know.\" He said quietly as if he spoke too loud then it would being our yelling fest back up again. He seemed sincere in wanting to know, so I told him. \"I wasn\\'t expecting what happened that day to go that far. All I was trying to do was be there for my best friend. When I climbed up to check on you and you told me to leave...that\\'s probably the worst thing you could have said to me that day.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"It was my job, and I more than anything wanted to be with you, no matter what. I-I didn\\'t care if you were going to give me a hard time. And then you did, and I left and it was my fault-\" I started to ramble. My heart was running miles and miles and the words just kept coming out after I held them in for so long. \"Woah, woah, stop, stop. You need to understand that you did everything you could that day Sharpay, but it was me who wasn\\'t letting you be there. At the time, I didn\\'t want you to.\" He said convincingly, looking at me as if he had no other choice. \"You never answered exactly why you didn\\'t want me there.\" \"I don\\'t know how to answer that or give you the answer you want.\" This was bullshit. If he was scared that I wouldn\\'t handle the truth then that\\'s just stupid. If anything knowing the truth, would set me free. \"Troy, I\\'m not in the mood for reading in between the lines just tell me. I want the whole truth.\" \"I wanted to hurt you.\" He whispered after a while hanging his head down. \"What, why?\" \"Because that was the only way I could get rid of you.\" He finally looked up at me and you could just see how much regret and sadness held in them when he told me. \"What did I do wrong?\" I squeaked. \"Christ, that\\'s the thing. You didn\\'t do anything wrong.\" He groaned, running a hand through his sandy locks and squeezing his eyes. \"Then why would you need to get rid of me?\" Troy stood silent looking at the ground before walking closer to me until we were an arm\\'s length apart. \"You were supposed to be in the car with me and Sam that day.\" \"Troy-what?\" \"If you were in the car, you would\\'ve been sitting where Sam was when we got it. You would\\'ve died on impact, like he did. The only reason you weren\\'t there is because you didn\\'t want to go eat with us after I practically begged you to come with. If you did go, you would\\'ve been dead, and I would\\'ve been responsible for killing you too.\" \"Oh, Troy, no.\" I whispered. This is what he\\'s been carrying this entire time? The possibility of what at the end of the day would not be in his control. My heart broke and tears started welling up. \"It made me realize that I couldn\\'t lose you like that. If Sam\\'s death destroyed me like that. I know for a fact I would never get over with what I would\\'ve done to you.\" A tear fell down his cheek when his voice cracked on the last word. He looked like he was in so much agony. I needed to put an end to it. He couldn\\'t destroy himself any further. \"When are you going to understand that entire accident was just that, an accident? An accident that was not your fault, especially not your fault. Troy, you did everything right. It was that drunk bastard\\'s fault for getting in a car fucked up as he was. And you- you held Sam when he was scared, and I know for a fact he felt safe with you there. He knew that before he left he was loved. That\\'s all that you could have done for him and some.\" \"Then why do I feel like I murdered him.\" He stared straight into my soul, his eyes pleading for the reality to set him free. \"Because you\\'re letting your fear of losing the people you love, fall onto your shoulders. You\\'re expecting the worst when you need to realize some things are not in your control. You do what you do best, which is you care and love Troy, and you live and cherish each moment. I know maybe other people have told you this but, do you think Sam would want to know that his big brother is blaming himself for his death? No, he wouldn\\'t. He would want you to live life to the fullest, because if there\\'s someone who deserves to live the best life possible, it\\'s you.\" \"You really mean that?\" He breathed, while tears were falling down his rosy cheeks. I smiled softly. Maybe some of my words were finally digging through his thick, stubborn skull. \"More than you know. Troy, I can\\'t be a hypocrite. I don\\'t want to blame myself for what happened with us anymore. It\\'s held me back and I don\\'t want that to prevent me from living my life. I want my best friend back, Troy.\" I stayed silent for a while. \"Is this too fast, or what do you say?\"']","Summary":" ['It wasn\\'t supposed to be like this.

The only thing she didn\\'t like was she wished Troy and Sharpay had gotten together during the second movie. Now I was a huge fan of High School Musical growing up I watched the first two on tv. I dragged my boyfriend at the time to the opening weekend of Senior Year during our senior year and I even played Kelsi when my school did High School Musical in middle school. Now I love the characters Troy and Gabriella together but I also loved the ideas my niece came up with. I told her how she could tell me her ideas and I would make it into a new version for her to read. She loved the ideas and wrote them all down. Then as I was working on this for her she was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer in her pelvis, spine and legs. She spent her final few weeks in the hospital and when she was able to come home for Thanksgiving I showed her what I had finished and she loved it. She wished that others could read it too and I told her about Fan Fiction and I told her I would post it. Unfortunately before she could see it posted she passed away at the age of 12 on November 25th. It has taken me awhile to look at this story again but I decided to post it so I could share it for her and share it with others. I hope you enjoy her ideas as much as I loved hearing her ideas. Chapter 1: Troy Bolton had just finished his junior year at East High where he had helped lead his basketball team to a state championship, stared in a winter musical with his girlfriend Gabriella and just enjoyed his hanging out with his friends. Now he was on summer and looking forward to hanging with his friends and girlfriend, shooting some hoops, and finding a part-time job to save up some money for a car for his senior year. He had just finished shooting some hoops with his dad and some of his best friends when his phone rang. When he answered he was shocked to find that it was a job offer from a Mr. Fulton from Lava Springs the town\\'s country club. He was so excited to be offered a job he didn\\'t even think about saying no it was just too good of an opportunity to pass up. He would be waiting tables or being a caddy when needed either job meant tips plus his minimum wage which meant a car sooner rather than later for him. When he returned to the kitchen his friends had already started eating the food his mom had laid out and were moving towards the family room to play some videogames. His mom asked who was on the phone. \"The manager of the Lava Spring country club offering me a job as a waiter for the summer. I accepted I figured it would give me a lot of tips from the rich people at the club.\" Said Troy. His mom looked at him that she was happy with his decision to take the job. \"That is a great job Troy you could use some of your tips towards your college fund.\" Troy just nodded before heading towards the family room to hang with his friends. He planned on telling them later about his job. Over the weekend he was too busy shooting hoops with his friends to tell them about his new job that he was starting on Monday. It wasn\\'t until late Sunday afternoon when he and the guys had just finished another game and were getting ready to leave. \"Dude are we on for another round of hoops tomorrow afternoon?\" asked Chad passing the ball to Troy. \"Uh yeah about that I can\\'t tomorrow I\\'ll be at work.\" Said Troy. \"Work? Since when have you gotten a job?\" asked Chad the rest of the guys looking at him too. \"Since Friday. I got a call from the country club offering me a job as a waiter. I said yes and I start tomorrow.\" Saud Troy tossing the ball back to Chad. \"Must be nice to just get offered a job. I\\'ll see you later or maybe I won\\'t since you\\'ll be a working man now.\" Said Chad walking out of the yard heading home. The rest of the guys looked between Troy and the gate that Chad had just walked out of for a few minutes. As they were leaving the rest of the guys congratulated him on his job Zeke told him that Chad will come around he\\'s just mad because he keeps losing out on jobs to college kids and now he won\\'t be able to afford the car he wants in time for the new school year. Later that night as Troy was getting ready for bed and was setting his alarm his cell phone rang, it was Gabriella. \"Hey Gabriella\" said Troy laying down in his bed. \"Trooooy is it true? I just hear from Martha who heard it from Kelsi and I had to call Taylor to confirm from Chad that you got a job?\" Troy rolled his eyes and said \"Yes. I got a job at Lava Springs I start tomorrow.\" \"But Troy! I thought we were going to hang out this summer. I know I tried finding a job and I know I\\'ll just be babysitting on weekends which cuts into our date time but I planned on us having dates during the day and spending our days with each other and now we can\\'t because you got a job and all the plans I made are out the window. Troy just sighed \"Gabriella we will still have time to hang out I promise its just I need the money college is coming soon and you know my parents are talking about how expensive college is and how a scholarship is only guaranteed based on my next season so I need to start saving now. This job is going to help me save.\" \"Troy you know you\\'re a shoe in for a scholarship you got this wildcat.\" \"Gabriella I know you think I\\'m guaranteed a scholarship but I can\\'t bank on that and I need to work but I gotta go I start work tomorrow morning.\" \"Fine. Goodnight Troy. I love you!\" said Gabriella. \"Yeah you too\" said Troy before hanging up and tossing his phone onto the end table. He rolled over and thought about how he needed the money towards college and that a scholarship wasn\\'t guaranteed. He knew he was good at basketball but he also knew that money didn\\'t grow on trees and there was no guarantee that U of A would give out scholarships for the following year.'][Chapter 2] ['Chapter 2: The next day Troy woke up early, showered and got dressed in a nice pair of checkered shorts, and an orange tee. He was told by Mr. Fulton that he would be given a uniform when he arrived. His mom dropped him off before heading into work his dad would be picking him up at the end of the shift as they both needed their cars today. He had meet Mr. Bolton at the front and he led him around back and through a pool gate. He was following Mr. Fulton when he heard a scream a teenage girl had tripped and fallen into the pool. He rushed over with Mr. Fulton thinking he might be able to help the lifeguard who had jumped in lift her out of the pool if needed. When the girl pooped up he saw it was Sharpay. He couldn\\'t contain his surprise. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked. She just looked at him with a hurt look on her face before it morphed into anger and she screamed and splashed the water and started to swim towards the stairs. Mr. Fulton choose that moment to lead Troy towards the kitchen where his uniform was waiting. On his way to the kitchen Mr. Fulton explained that Sharpay\\'s parents owned the country club and the family had a lifetime membership. Troy didn\\'t know that. He had grown up with Sharpay and he knew that her parents had money he could remember when they were younger and had invited the whole class to her and Ryan\\'s birthday party and they had had a bouncy house, horse rides, clown and dancers at her house. He remembers she and Ryan were the talk of the class after that party but the following year he and Sharpay were in separate classes so he didn\\'t get an invite to the next party. Troy was lost in his thoughts as he changed into his uniform and when Mr. Fulton explained how he was a waiter and would call guests by Mr., Mrs., or Miss, caddy when needed. He explained that he was to clock in on time not one minute later. He also discussed that any tips given to him by the members where his to keep along with his normal paycheck. He was then introduced to some of the rest of the staff including the chef, some of the wait staff that had been there for a few years and were home from college break. He was surprised when Kelsi walked in. He asked what she was doing there. \"I\\'m playing music for the dining room and tea parties. Sharpay pretty much told me I had to be here but hey at least it\\'s a job and I get to play the piano all day and on my breaks I can write new music. Hey you should have Gabriella come on our breaks and we can work on new songs for the musical next year!\" said Kelsi excitedly. \"No..No..No my musical career started and ended with the last musical. I\\'m just here to work and get paid to save up for college. Plus Gabriella isn\\'t coming here to visit me I\\'ll be working. Sorry Kelsi\" said Troy before heading out to the main dining room to start his job. Troy loved his job even though it was a lot of work he was able to meet many of the members who came into have lunch or dinner. Some of the members recognized him from basketball and he even found out that some of the members were alumni of U&A; and were booster club members. He also loved the tips he got. He did notice that he got more tips from the married women and occasionally he did have to say he had a girlfriend when one of the members started talking about having a granddaughter that was near his age and was single. Every night Troy came home and he put all of his tips in a jar that was labeled college. His parents kept saying how proud they were of him for thinking of his future. His dad and him had also started working on a truck that was very old and rusted. His dad had said that it was an old beater truck for him to drive back and forth to work so he didn\\'t put so many miles on his lease car, he also said it would be great for lugging all of the basketball gear around. Troy and his dad had been working on the truck since before school let out and it was finally running better. They had many conversations while fixing the truck mostly about Troy\\'s future but tonight\\'s conversation was different. \"How come I haven\\'t seen any of the guys around lately?\" asked his dad. \"They haven\\'t been around at all Chad is still mad at me for taking the job and the guys have all been hanging around at his house shooting hoops over there.\" Said Troy working on the radiator. \"What about Gabriella? We haven\\'t seen her around here lately either.\" His dad pried. Troy sighed and put down the tools \"We haven\\'t talked lately she\\'s been babysitting at nights and I work during the day and she\\'s hanging out with the girls by the pool during the day last I knew.\" Troy looked over at his dad and saw a look on his face \"I know I haven\\'t always been Gabriella\\'s biggest fan especially during basketball season but maybe you are just growing apart. Your future is heading in different directions your heading to U of A and she\\'s heading to some kind of Ivy League maybe this summer is just showing you that she\\'s not the right fit for you. Was she understanding of you getting a job to save for your future?\" asked his dad. \"Not really she was upset that I would be working all the time she kept saying I didn\\'t need to worry about money that I was a shoe in for a scholarship next year but I can\\'t guarantee that I\\'m only as good as my next season, you tell me that all the time my scholarship chances depend on how I play next year. That\\'s why I\\'ve been practicing during lunch and we practice when I get home from work.\" Said Troy beginning to pace the small area in the garage. \"Troy I think you have a great chance for a scholarship for college but I also know that next year anything could happen. I also know that everyone around you should be supportive of you trying to save for your future and be supportive of your goals for the future.\" Said his dad putting a hand on his shoulder. \"Thanks dad. I think I\\'m going to shower and head to bed I have work in the morning.\" Said Troy tossing the tools back into the toolbox and heading inside. He had a lot to think about.'][Chapter 3] ['Chapter 3: The next day at work Troy was just getting ready to clock in when Kelsi stopped him and asked him to look at a song she had written for him and Gabriella. \"The Star Dazzle Talent Show for Lave Springs is coming up and staff is allowed to participate and I wrote this song for you and Gabriella and I thought you could sing it with her. I already showed her the song and she loved it. I know she would make sure that she had the night off all you have to do is sign up and we can work on your part on your breaks and then at nights with Gabriella. The sign ups are outside Mr. Fulton\\'s office. I know with you and Gabriella singing together you could beat Sharpay she has won every year for the past five years\" said Kelsi bouncing with excitement especially at the thought of beating Sharpay. \"No…uh no sorry Kelsi but like I told you the other day I\\'m not singing again my musical career started and ended with the winter musical. I\\'m just here to work and make money towards college and maybe sneak in a couple rounds of golf if I can. So sorry but no.\" said Troy looking for a way to escape. \"But Gabriella is already working on the song and really loved the song and she was really looking forward to it. Come on Troy, please?\" said Kelsi looking at him. \"Sorry Kelsi but no I don\\'t know why you would show the song to Gabriella when I already told you a few days ago that I wasn\\'t singing anymore in a musical or otherwise.\" Said Troy walking toward the kitchen so he could clock in for the day. What he didn\\'t know was that Ryan was outside of the ballroom where Kelsi had cornered him and had run to Sharpay to let her know that Kelsi had written a song for Troy and Gabriella to sing at the Star Dazzle but Troy had turned her down saying that he wasn\\'t going to sing. Sharpay hadn\\'t been happy to find out that Kelsi had written a song for Troy and Gabriella but she was happy to find out that Troy didn\\'t want to sing with Gabriella he just wanted to earn money for college. What Ryan didn\\'t know is that Sharpay was already making a plan, to get Troy to sing with her in the Star Dazzle Awards and if she could get her hands on it they could sing the song that Kelsi wrote for Troy and Gabriella. She was already forming plans and had to go talk to Mr. Fulton. It had been a long day at work and he just wanted to go home and relax. When he got home his dad asked him to help him with the truck a new part had arrived and he wanted to get it in so that the truck was drivable. After a few hours of putting the part in the truck was drivable he and his dad had just gone for a test drive around the block. When they got back to the house his dad tossed him the keys. \"Here you go, enjoy\" \"What? Really this is mine?\" asked Troy. \"What you didn\\'t think I was going to drive this piece of junk did you? No it\\'s yours now you don\\'t have to rely on your mom and me to take you to work and pick you up and you can go to your friend\\'s house when you need too. But Troy this truck is your responsibility, your mom and I will pay the insurance but it is up to you to put gas in it, keep it up to date on inspections, and if it breaks fix it or take it to someone who can fix it.\" Said the coach. \"No worries dad I got this thank you\" said Troy. \"Go thank your mother it was her idea that we should get you a car.\" So Troy rushed off to thank his mother. The next day after Troy had clocked into work Mr. Fulton came looking for him. \"Mr. Bolton! You have been requested to be a caddy today. Looks like someone knows of your golf history.\" He said throwing a different uniform at him. Troy was shocked he knew he could be a caddy for the day but most members had requested other staff that had been there longer and were more well known. He also knew Mr. Fulton had meant his experience of being on the East High Golf Team but he hadn\\'t told anyone at Lava Springs about that. Now he was curious about who he was caddying for. After changing and heading out onto the green he had his answer there next to a pink golf cart was Sharpay and Ryan. \"Hi Troy!\" said Sharpay bouncing over to him. \"Hi Sharpay, I guess I\\'m your caddy for the day?\" said Troy grinning at her and Ryan. \"Oh no Troy not me, your caddying for Daddy.\" Said Sharpay looking at Ryan. \"Oh daddy, and where is daddy?\" asked Troy looking around but seeing no one but the three of them. Sharpay just pointed to the sky. It took Troy a minute to realize what he was seeing then he realized what it was, it was a helicopter. When it landed a well-dressed man and women stepped out. Sharpay took his hand and literally dragged him over to meet them when the helicopter was out of the way. \"Daddy, Mommy, this is Troy he\\'s going to be your Caddy for the day Daddy.\" Troy just smiled and shook his hand. \"Welcome Troy. Honey where your mother\\'s caddy is?\" he asked Sharpay. \"I don\\'t know daddy, I requested her usual to Mr. Fulton and he said he would get right on it.\" Said Sharpay. Then a young man who also worked in the kitchen with Troy came running up out of breath, Troy didn\\'t know his name but he felt bad for the guy he looked like he was going to be sick. \"So-sorry im late sir, ma\\'am Mr. Fulton just told me that you were expecting me and I was across the green with another client and had to wait for my replacement.\" Said the boy. As the family headed toward the tee Troy took Mr. Evans bag and followed. It seemed that Mr. Evans would be going first. He noticed that he had a good form and it seemed like he played often and knew what he was doing. He felt bad for the boy who he found out was named Toby who had to caddy for Mrs. Evans, as soon as she stepped up to hit the ball he noticed that everyone had stepped back so he did too then he understood why. She was terrible not that he would ever say that out loud. As the game Mr. Evans had begun to ask Troy for pointers and which club was using. After giving him a great tip Sharpay told her dad about Troy being on the East High Golf Team. After that Troy was allowed to use Mr. Evan\\'s clubs to play a round. What Troy didn\\'t know what that while he was playing a round Sharpay and her dad were talking? \"You know daddy Troy isn\\'t good at just golf he was also on the basketball team where he lead the team to victory in the championship game. Wouldn\\'t he make a great addition to the UOA team?\" said Sharpay who knew her dad was on the board at UOA and on in charge of the booster club for the athletics department. \"Hmm interesting you know what princess I think you are right he would make a fine addition to my alma mater. I think I\\'ll make a few calls see what I can do.\" Said Mr. Evans. After the game was finished Troy went back to work. He was almost through with his shift when Mr. Fulton came into the kitchen looking for him. \"Mr. Bolton, you have five minutes to change and come with me. If you are not familiar with this item, it goes around your neck, like a uh dog collar\" he said handing him a navy suit jacket, white shirt, navy dress pants and a blue tie. Troy had no idea what was going on but he knew better then to ask questions. After Troy had changed into the new suit Mr. Fulton explained that he was invited to have dinner with the Evans family and a few other club members. Troy was introduced around the table to Peter and Claire. Peter was also on the UOA board. They began to talk about the different vacations the two couples had taken, then the discussion turned to UOA and Troy. \"You know Troy I saw your championship game and the game winning shot at the buzzer, a heck of a play\" said Peter. \"Oh well you know it took a lot of team work if it wasn\\'t for my teammates I wouldn\\'t have had the ball. \"Said Troy trying to play down his role in front of Peter and the Evans. But then Sharpay jumped in \"Oh you\\'re being entirely too modest Troy. Don\\'t let him fool you, Troy was voted MVP for the entire season.\" This made Mr. Evans and Peter to smile in his direction. Mr. Evans then went on to say \"You know we have an excellent basketball program at UOA and an excellent scholarship program as well. Yeah you know between the two of us here we pull a little weight over at the school\" \"Oh wow, that\\'s um nice and all but you don\\'t have to go to all that trouble really.\" Said Troy, he knew that he wanted to earn his way onto a team and earn his own scholarship. \"Oh nonsense Troy, now let\\'s talk golf.\" Said Mr. Evans. Sharpay jumped in again and said \"Oh golf and basketball are just the beginning with Troy Daddy. Have you heard him sing?\" \"Oh how wonderful Troy could participate here in the talent show.\" Said Mrs. Evans. \"Oh come on Troy give them a sample.\" Said Sharpay leaning into him. \"Ohh I don\\'t know\" said Tory \"Oh nonsense go on then Troy\" said Peter \"Oh yes Troy come on I\\'ll even sing with you!\" said Sharpay jumping up and grabbing Troy\\'s hand to pull him up and over to the piano. Sharpay dragged him over to the piano and began to go through Kelsi\\'s music folder. \"Sharpay I don\\'t know about this.\" Said Troy \"Oh nonsense Troy, just think of your future, come on we got this its one song. Here Kelsi play this, this should do.\" Said Sharpay handing Kelsi the piece that she had written for Troy and Gabriella. \"Oh this piece isn\\'t for yo—\" started Kelsi but Sharpay interrupted her and said \"Play.\" And glared at her. So Kelsi began to play while Sharpay grabbed the other copy to share between herself and Troy and then began to sing. (Sharpay sang at the slow rate not the fast rate like she did in the movie instead she began to sing like Gabriella did) Sharpay: Na na na na Na na na na na, yeah You are the music in me You know the words \"once upon a time\" Make you listen, there\\'s a reason When you dream there\\'s a chance you\\'ll find A little laugher, or happy ever after Troy and Sharpay: You\\'re a harmony to the melody That\\'s echoing inside my head Sharpay: A single voice Troy: Single voice Sharpay: Above the noise Both: And like a common thread Troy: Hmm, you\\'re pulling me Sharpay: When I hear my favorite song I know that we belong Troy: Oh, you are the music in me Yeah, it\\'s living in all of us Sharpay: And it\\'s brought us here because Both: Because you are the music in me Na na na na (oh) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me Sharpay: It\\'s like I knew you before we met (before we met) Can\\'t explain it (uh-huh) There\\'s no name for it (no name for it) Both: I sang you words I\\'ve never said Troy: And it was easy (so easy) Because you see the real me (I see) Both: As I am you understand (us) And that\\'s more than I\\'ve ever known Sharpay: To hear your voice Troy: Hear your voice Sharpay: Above the noise (oh) Both: And I know that I\\'m alone Sharpay: Oh, you\\'re singing to me Troy: Ooh, yeah Both: When I hear my favorite song I know that we belong (yeah, oh) You are the music in me It\\'s living in all of us And it\\'s brought us here because Because you are the music in me Together we\\'re gonna sing, yeah We got the power to say what we feel (what we feel) Troy: Connected and real Sharpay: Can\\'t keep it all inside, oh yeah Troy: Ooh, yeah Na na na na (oh yeah) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me Na na na na (oh yeah) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me All: When I hear my favorite song (favorite song) I know that we belong (we belong) Oh, you are the music in me Troy: Yeah Both: It\\'s living in all of us It\\'s brought us here because (here because) You are the music in me Na na na na (oh yeah) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me Troy: Yeah (whoo) Troy and Sharpay had some how ended up dancing around the piano as they were singing. Troy hadn\\'t even really realized that he was doing it, it was just he was really getting into the song and even though he wouldn\\'t admit it out loud it was kind of nice to sing with Sharpay when she wasn\\'t acting like a diva. He also wondered if this was what it was like to sing with Sharpay all the time. After they finished all of the Evans, Peter and Claire stood up and started clapping along with a few other guests that had still been in the dining room. Sharpay took a bow and dragged Troy back to the table where everyone complemented them on their performance. \"Now for some dessert.\" Said Mr. Evans as he waved a waiter down to come to the table. Later that night when he got home he told his parents about the dinner. His dad was excited about the UOA connection and said to take whatever opportunity that came his way scholarships don\\'t come every day. After his dad had left the room to fix more popcorn and grab a new drink his mom looked at him. \"Something seems different with you.\" She said looking at him critically. Troy just looked at her and knew that he was giving her a confused look. \"I think I know what it is. Troy your happy. How did you feel having Mr. Evans and that Peter man say how great you were in not just basketball and golf but in singing too? How did you feel singing with Sharpay? I noticed you made it seem like it was no big deal but I know you and I know that you loved doing the musical, and even though your dad doesn\\'t like to admit it we both know that you loved being on the stage and the stage loved having you on it.\" Said his mom. Troy was shocked that his mom knew him that well. \"I loved it. It was nice to hear someone that wasn\\'t you or dad saying how good I was and it was nice just to sing but with no auditions hanging over my head or Gabriella saying that we had to sing that the school was counting on us to change the status quo or the guys laughing at me for liking to sing. It was nice just to sing a song with no worries other than I need to impress these people. I uh also really liked singing with Sharpay and I don\\'t know what that means.\" Said Troy putting his head back on the back of the couch. \"Troy you know I like Gabriella but its ok to like singing with Sharpay. Now I haven\\'t seen Sharpay since you were both kids but I remember her as a nice girl? It\\'s ok if you don\\'t want to be with Gabriella anymore. It\\'s ok if you want to be with Sharpay now. It\\'s ok you are young and in High School it\\'s ok to change your mind.\" Said his mom reaching over and running a hand through his hair like she used to when he was a little kid. \"I don\\'t know what I want anymore. I mean Gabriella is nice and all but I don\\'t know lately she has been whiney and clingy and just I don\\'t know. But tonight singing with Sharpay was nice and it was nice spending the day with her and her parents even if I was just the caddy but they treated me like I was part of the family. I just don\\'t know anymore.\" Said Troy. His mom just looked at him \"Maybe you need to take a break from all girls and just focus on yourself and what you want and then when you figure out what you want you can go for it.\" \"Yeah maybe…well I\\'m off to bed it\\'s been a long day and I\\'m exhausted.\" Said Troy getting up and heading towards his room. His parents stayed up later and had a discussion about their son. \"I like the Evans.\" Said her husband \"So do I, I think Troy does too.\" Said Mrs. Bolton. \"What is going on with him and Gabriella though? I tried to get a little out of him the other night when we were working on the truck but I didn\\'t get much on that front. I did find out that the reason the boys haven\\'t been around a lot lately is because Chad is upset that Troy got a summer job and he didn\\'t and the guys have been playing at Chad\\'s house.\" Said Mr. Bolton. \"I didn\\'t know about Chad but that makes sense why they haven\\'t been around. I found out that Troy and Gabriella are rocky right now and Troy doesn\\'t know what he wants. I think he is leaning on not wanting Gabriella. I think a Sharpay Evans plays into some of this. Did you notice the look he got on his face when he talked about her tonight?\" she asked her husband. \"I did it\\'s a look I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen on his face unless he\\'s talking about basketball. Good for him if he wants to play the field. I know I have never been the biggest fan of Gabriella\\'s she was nice and all but something just didn\\'t feel right with her like Troy wasn\\'t as happy as he could be. \" Said Mr. Bolton. They ended the discussion there and went to bed.'][Chapter 4] ['Chapter 4: The next day was Saturday and Troy decided that he missed his friends so he took his truck and drove over to Chad\\'s house. When he pulled up he saw the guys playing basketball in Chad\\'s driveway and Gabriella, Kelsi, and Taylor. He parked and got out of his car and noticed that they had all stopped what they were doing and were watching him. \"Uh…hey guys\" said Troy shoving his hands in his pockets. \"Troy dude…what\\'s up\" asked Zeke. Troy just looked at them and said \"Uh nothing just been uh working a lot. What about you guys? How have you been?\" \"Must be nice to be so busy that you don\\'t have anytime to hang out with your friends, what about your girlfriend have you seen her lately?\" asked Chad stepping up to the front of the group holding the ball. \"I just told you I\\'ve been working at the club all day and most nights then when I do get home my dad and I have been working on my new truck, to make it drivable. So sorry I haven\\'t been around as much as you would like but I have been busy making money.\" Said Troy starting to get annoyed at his so called best friend. Gabriella chose that moment to come up and say \"What about having dinner and singing with Sharpay the other night? I had texted you asking to make plans and you never answered back but then I had to find out from Kelsi that you had dinner with Sharpay and sang the song that Kelsi wrote for us Troy. What do you have to say about that?!\" asked Gabriella putting her hands on her hips. \"First of all it wasn\\'t just dinner with Sharpay it was a dinner with Sharpay, Ryan, their parents and friends of their family Peter and his wife Claire. Second of all we were discussing how I play basketball and golf when Ryan and Sharpay brought up the fact that I can also sing and was in the winter musical. The Evans, Peter and Claire wanted to hear me sing but I didn\\'t want to sing by myself but then it was suggested that I sing with Sharpay and she brought me up to the piano and choose the song. I didn\\'t know that it was the song that Kelsi had written for you and me I had never even looked at the song until I sang it with Sharpay.\" Said Troy looking at Gabriella. He knew he was leaving out some of the details of the night but his friends didn\\'t need those details. \"But Troy we should have sang the song that is our song! Kelsi said she wrote the song for us and tried to tell Sharpay that the song wasn\\'t hers to sing but she didn\\'t listen and you just stood there. Plus why are you even singing with her in the first place you should have said no.\" \"Yeah Troy why are you even having dinner with the Ice Queen in the first place? We hate her remember?\" asked Chad. Then Taylor stepped in and said \"Do you not remember how she made Gabriella\\'s life miserable over the drama with the winter musical?\" \"Look! I don\\'t have to explain any of this to you. The Evans family invited me to dinner, they own the country club where I work so I wasn\\'t going to say no. Besides Sharpay isn\\'t really that bad, she was nice at dinner. Also about the winter musical thing how do you think you would feel Taylor if someone new came in and tried to take away being captain of the decathlon team, or you chad if someone came in and took your spot on the team? That\\'s how Sharpay is about the musical. Yes she wasn\\'t the nicest person about the music but I can\\'t really blame her to much because anyone of us would have done the same thing if we had been in her position.\" Said Troy looking at all of them. \"Troy that\\'s not the point the point is you still sang with her! And Kelsi has been telling us how you have been hanging around Sharpay and that you spent the day with her.\" Said Gabriella. \"Is that is Troy are you ditching us for the ice princess?\" asked Chad. \"Look I spent the other day with Sharpay, Ryan and their parents being their caddy. SO excuse me if spending the day with them means doing my job. I shouldn\\'t have to explain myself to you or any of you for that matter. I\\'m working. I\\'m sorry that I got a job that I actually like but I\\'m not going to apologize that I took the job. If you don\\'t like the fact that I have to spend time with club members no matter who that are that\\'s just too bad.\" Said Troy getting frustrated. \"Look man, it\\'s not that we aren\\'t happy for you getting a job and all but didn\\'t you tell us that this summer would be spent hanging out, shooting hoops and just relaxing? Instead you\\'re never around, your always working and then we hear your having dinner with the ice princess. That\\'s not the Troy Bolton that we know\" said Chad passing the ball to Troy. \"Again I like my job it\\'s not that bad. I take food to the club members. I make some great tips. I also get the chance to caddy occasionally and I make even more money, all of this money is going towards my college fund. You guys get it you know how important it is for my parents for me to go to college and we know how chances at scholarships can come and go and how it depends on the next season. So yes I\\'m working a lot I have a college fund to save for. Chad man you know my dream is to go to UOA and you know a full scholarship for them is rare that means I need to come up with at least half the tuition.\" Said Troy passing the ball back to Chad. \"Yeah I know dude but I just thought we could all enjoy the summer together this is probably our last summer all together to just hang out and shoot hoops.\" Said Chad. \"I know man and I promise I\\'ll try better but at the same time I haven\\'t seen any of you reaching out to me either.\" Said Troy. His so called friends were just looking at him then Zeke said \"I tried to tell them that it wasn\\'t that big of a deal but you know how some things are just blown out of proportion. You want to play some hoops captain?\" \"Yeah let\\'s do this.\" Said Troy starting to dribble the ball towards Chad\\'s net. That is how Troy spent the next few hours just shooting hoops with the guys as the girls watched from the grass while they talked about who knows what. After the fifth game of the afternoon/night and it was starting to get dark they called it a night. Troy headed towards his truck with Gabriella following him for a ride home. Once in the truck, Gabriella started in on Troy again. \"Troy how could you hang out with her? Work or not why couldn\\'t you have switched with someone else? Why would you willingly spend time with her? You know what she\\'s like and what she did to me! You are meant to be hanging out with me this summer. This is my first summer where I wasn\\'t moving and could have a summer romance. You are supposed to be having a summer romance with me.\" Said Gabriella throwing her hands up into the air while glaring at him. Troy sighed he was starting to get annoyed at her. He continued to drive in silence they were almost to her house. \"Troy are you even listening to me?!\" yelled Gabriella. Troy had just pulled up to her house and he couldn\\'t take it anymore. \"Enough Gabriella! I\\'m sick and tired of you telling me what I can and can\\'t do. I was doing my job and you shouldn\\'t make me feel bad for doing my job. Why can\\'t you understand that!\" yelled Troy. \"Really Troy?! Why can\\'t you understand that I don\\'t want you to be near Sharpay?\" \"You know what Gabriella if you can\\'t support me doing a job that I actually like and be ok with doing the things that my job requires then maybe we shouldn\\'t be together anymore!\" yelled Troy. At this point they had gotten out of the truck and were on her front lawn. \"Really Troy this is exactly what Sharpay wants to happen!\" yelled Gabriella. Really Gabriella this has nothing to do with Sharpay and everything to do with the fact that you can\\'t trust me and don\\'t support me with my job!\" yelled Troy. \"Really Troy I would support you if you didn\\'t want to spend all your time at your job hanging out with Sharpay when you could be spending the summer with me like you promised!\" \"You know what Gabriella I\\'ve had enough of this we\\'re through! I\\'m done I\\'ve gotta go my own way.\" Said Troy storming back to his truck. \"Troy! Wait come back here! Troy!\" yelled Gabriella. But Troy ignored her and drove away. When Troy got home he stomped up to his room to mad at everything to care if he was waking up his parents, he just didn\\'t care he was tired. He flopped down on his bed and grabbed his basketball and began to toss it up into the air. His door opened a few minutes later with his mom coming in tying her robe shut. \"Troy…honey are you ok?\" she asked coming to sit on the edge of his bed. Troy just sighed and didn\\'t say anything. \"Did something happen with you and the guys I know you had called to say that you were playing a game of hoops with the guys.\" She probed. Troy just continued to throw the ball up into the air and catch it. \"Did something happen with you and Gabriella?\" Troy stopped throwing the ball up in the air and she knew that she had the right topic. \"Did you get into a fight?\" \"You could say that.\" Scoffed Troy. \"Did you break up?\" she asked. \"Yeah we did. She kept going on about how I shouldn\\'t be near Sharpay even if my job requires it. Then she went on and on about how I shouldn\\'t be working I should be spending my summer with her having a \\'summer romance\\' because this is the first year she is staying in one place for the summer.\" Said Troy starting to throw the ball up in the air. His mother grabbed the ball from midair \"Troy, did you want to break up with Gabriella or did you just do it because you got mad in the moment?\" \"I wanted to break up with her. I just didn\\'t want it to be a big fight.\" Said Troy sitting up to look at his mom. \"Troy did you just expect her to say ok Troy I understand go on your merry way?\" \"Well no I just I don\\'t know what I thought I just know that I didn\\'t want to be so mean but I don\\'t feel bad about breaking up with her. We just didn\\'t feel right anymore you know what I mean?\" asked Troy. \"I do Troy. Sometimes breakups like this happen and there isn\\'t anything we can do about it. I just know that you can be sad for a while but don\\'t let it keep you down Troy.\" Said his mom kissing him on his head giving him his ball back and heading out of the room.'][Chapter 5] ['Chapter 5: The next day Troy woke up feeling a little bit better. It still hurt because he had enjoyed his relationship with Gabriella but he knew that he made the right decision in breaking up with her. When he got to work he was told that Mr. Fulton was looking for him. When he found them in the lobby Mr. Fulton told him that he was getting promoted to a junior golf instructor \"What you want me to teach kids?\" asked Troy. \"To Kids oh the joy\" said Mr. Fulton. \"Sir, this is nice and all but I don\\'t think I\\'m qualified.\" Said Troy still shocked over the idea. \"Oh not to worry simply show the little angels where to hold the club then duck it\\'s that simple. In addition the board is extending club membership to you. Congratulations.\" Said Mr. Fulton as he led Troy to the men\\'s locker room. He showed him a locker, put a code in and opened the door. Inside was a variety of shirts and pants, including a pair of shoes. \"Wow!\" said Troy \"You\\'ll find an appropriate choice of clothing here. Do not mix checks with plaids, blue with browns, and avoid wearing white socks at all costs. Leave your shoes outside the locker each night and they will be returned to you buffed and shined each day. Here are your complimentary clubs. Now this might come in handy. That\\'s the key to your golf cart. Number 13 the same number on your basketball jersey or so I\\'m told. Any questions?\" asked Mr. Fulton handing the key to Troy. \"How did this happen?\" asked Troy. \"It would seem the Evans family believes that you have untapped potential. Young man, the future is full of uncharted waters and this family has a lot of clout. SO I suggest that you take the ride.\" Said Mr. Fulton as he walked away. After changing into his new uniform and taking his new golf cart out for a spin troy went to the practice range to meet his first group of kids. He noticed that he had a few kids waiting. He got them each set up at their own station and showed each of them how to hold the club and swing. He then let them each have a few swings, before going around and correcting their form. Then his 11:30 showed up. He was surprised to find that it was Sharpay. \"Troy!\" she said running over to the open spot and dumping her custom pink balls. Troy began to show her how to hold the club. \"You look fabulous in your new clothes by the way.\" \"Thanks it\\'s the Italian shoes what do you think?\" he asked she said they looked great. She then started talking about doing the end of summer talent show with him. \"I\\'m excited about the show.\" \"Look Sharpay I\\'ve said this a lot but singing isn\\'t really my thing it\\'s yours.\" \"But Troy all of the Red Hawk boosters will be there. We can lock up your scholarship with a High C from center stage. We\\'re all in this together right?\" she asked. \"Look Sharpay your parents have been great, amazing really but singing with you isn\\'t in my job description.\" \"I know I was just trying to help you Troy. I know you just like to sing with Gabriella and I thought that maybe I could sing with you to help you. I always win the Star Dazzle award and I thought that if the boosters saw you win with singing as well they would see you as a triple threat.\" Said Sharpay. \"Gabriella and I won\\'t be singing together anymore since we broke up last night.\" Said Troy. \"What? Why\" asked Sharpay, even she was shocked she thought that they would never break up and they would stay together all through high school and go to college\\'s near one another so they could be together in college too. \"We just started to head towards different paths. She didn\\'t understand that my focus needs to be on my future and she didn\\'t support my decisions to reach my goal. She also didn\\'t support me in my job. I can\\'t even imagine what she would say to my new job. Hell the guys won\\'t believe it either or if they do they\\'ll get pissed off at me again like they did when I first took the job.\" Said Troy showing her again how to hit the ball with a different form. \"Well I\\'m sorry about you and Gabriella Troy but I don\\'t blame you for not wanting to be with someone who doesn\\'t support you in reaching your goals. Daddy always says that the right person for you will do everything in their power to help you achieve your goal. And mommy says that it is the job of each partner to help the other during the high times and the low times and if someone can\\'t do that then they aren\\'t the right one for you.\" Said Sharpay. \"Thanks Sharpay. That\\'s actually really good advice. You know what Sharpay I bet that if we sang in the talent show we will win for sure. I have one condition though no theatrics like your other shows have been. No fancy costumes, or back up singers and dancers just you and me singing. And no dancing that\\'s not my strong suit, we can just stand on stage and sing together. So what do you say are you in?\" asked Troy. \"Of course I\\'m in we got this Troy we do need to practice but are you sure we don\\'t need to spice up the tempo a little bit so we can keep people awake?\" asked Sharpay. \"I think just the fact that we are on stage singing together will keep people awake Sharpay.\" Said Troy laughing. They were interrupted from their conversation by another staff member saying that Mr. Fulton was looking for him. \"Sorry Sharpay we will have to pick this up another time. I\\'ll see you later ok.\" Said Troy heading off to find Mr. Fulton. When he did find him he was then lead to the lobby to see Mr. Evans talking to three men that he recognized as Red Hawks players who were going into their junior year. \"Troy there you are, come here there are some guys I\\'d like you to meet. This is –\"I know I\\'ve seen them play at UOA.\" \"Well hey come scrimmage at our gym with us\" said one. \"Play with you guys?\" asked Troy he was shocked. \"Yeah show us your moves, we heard you know how to get down bro\" the player replied. \"Awesome, yeah\" replied Troy shaking each players hand. \"Excellent! Let\\'s all get some lunch\" said Mr. Evans. While waiting for lunch Troy was showing the guys how to get a better grip on their golf clubs and giving them tips on how to improve their golf game. Sharpay had joined them all for lunch and had ended up sitting next to him. During lunch they continued to talk golf and basketball. Troy asking what practices were like, what the weight room, and locker rooms were like and other questions about the school like the dorms if the food was good and what the classes were like. \"Maybe if you have time after practice we\\'ll give you a tour of the campus and show you around. If you\\'re as half as good as we heard we know you\\'ll be joining the team after next season.\" \"That would be great sure!\" said Troy. After lunch Troy went back to teaching the kid\\'s golf but in the afternoon he only had private lessons where he taught one to two kids at a time. When he was done for the night he had changed back into his street clothes as Mr. Fulton called them and was heading towards his truck when he was stopped. \"Troy! Wait!\" yelled Sharpay. Troy turned around and waited for Sharpay to catch up. \"When do you want to start rehearsing for the talent show?\" she asked. \"I\\'m free most nights anymore, so any day after work would work for me.\" Sai Troy looking down at her, he had never noticed how short she was when she wasn\\'t wearing heels. \"O.k. I\\'ll tell Kelsi that we\\'re free to start rehearsing starting tomorrow after you get out of work.\" Said Sharpay. \"Uh I don\\'t know if working with Kelsi is a good idea Sharpay. I think that maybe we should find someone else. Do you have someone else?\" asked Troy. He wasn\\'t as keen to use Kelsi who would go back and tell Gabriella and everyone else everything that they did. \"Oh I don\\'t think Kelsi will be a problem but if you really don\\'t want to use her I do have someone else that would be able to be our rehearsal pianist. But Kelsi is working at the talent show for others, so we will have to use her then.\" Said Sharpay. \"That\\'s fine Sharpay I just think it would be better for us to practice with someone who doesn\\'t know our history. I also don\\'t want to deal wit Gabriella. I know were broke up but if she hears from Kelsi who is one of her best friends about us singing together she\\'ll call non stop or come to my house to ask me about it. I would much rather not have to deal with her anymore I would like a clean break you know?\" said Troy. \"I do. I know I wouldn\\'t want to have to deal with and explain things with my ex and you shouldn\\'t have to either. Don\\'t worry about it we\\'ll practice with someone else till the talent show.\" Said Sharpay. \"Thanks Sharpay. Hey I\\'ll see you tomorrow ok?\" asked Troy smiling at her. \"Sure I\\'ll see you tomorrow Troy\" said Sharpay reaching over to hug Troy before sashaying away with Troy to shock to do nothing but stare at her as she walked away.'][Chapter 6] ['Chapter 6: The next day Troy and Sharpay began to practice with Sharpay and Ryan\\'s former piano teacher. She had come to help them rehearse out of the kindness of her heart, she was a sweet old lady. At first Troy had to talk to Sharpay about the tempo as she had made it more upbeat and tried to add in choreography and had talked about adding background singers. It took about 15 minutes before she agreed to go back to the original tune and just the two of them on stage. It might have helped because Troy had told her that if it was just the two of them on stage then the spotlight was on them and not anyone else, and if it was slower they were on stage longer. After about an hour of rehearsing which Troy felt was a lot Sharpay invited Troy to dinner with her, as he was hungry he agreed. They had dinner in the dining room. They talked about classes at east high, their families, the musicals and basketball. They even talked about their plans for after high school. Sharpay talked about going to New York and going to Julliard and as a backup plan going to UOA because they had a good performing arts program. She asked Troy if he had any backup plans and he said a few schools were looking at him a few east and a few out in California but he hadn\\'t really looked at them as he had his heart set on UOA but that he would start looking more into schools next year during the season. After dinner they parted ways but not before Sharpay hugged Troy but this time it was different as Troy hugged Sharpay back. He knew he was beginning to feel something for her, he didn\\'t know what it was if it was lust because he couldn\\'t deny that she was very good looking or if it was that he wanted to be her boyfriend. The next day Mr. Evans found him before his shift started to let him know that he had worked it out with the UOA coach and team for Troy to join in on a practice with the team. \"Really? With the team? Yeah I\\'ll be there. Thank you sir I really appreciate all that you have been doing for me. I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to replay you.\" Said Troy. \"Oh don\\'t worry about that Troy I would just like to see you in a Red Hawks jersey after high school so you can help lead my alma-mater to a division 1 championship and hopefully a national championship.\" Troy just laughed and nodded before shaking the mans hand and heading towards the locker room to get ready for his shift. It seemed that his shift dragged on. He had texted Sharpay to let her know that he couldn\\'t make rehearsal tonight and why he couldn\\'t. She hadn\\'t responded by the time he made it to the Red Hawks gym and meet his dad, some members of the board including Peter and Mr. Evans and the head coach Kevin O\\'Neill. The practice was awesome they had run some drills and had a practice scrimmage before a short break where when Troy had checked his phone he saw a message from Sharpay saying she understood and to break a leg with his basketball practice and that she knew he would be great. Troy had to laugh at her text where she said break a leg, as she only knew stage terminology. He was called away before he could respond to her text. At the end of the practice he was given his own Red Hawks jacket from the guys on the team who were impressed with his skills. He was then introduced to the coach by Mr. Evans. The coach then proceed to tell him and his dad that he had a bright future ahead of him and that he would be in touch with them to talk scholarships. That night was one Troy would remember when he saw the look on his dad\\'s face when the coach said how great Troy was and that a scholarship was possible. It had been him and his dad\\'s dream for Troy to play for the UOA Red Hawks. They had been going to games together since Troy was a little kid. The next day at work Troy was telling Sharpay about it over her golf lesson. He knew that she was actually really good you could see that she was pretending to be bad. He knew that this was her way to see him and hang out with him. It also meant that he got to hang out with her and he didn\\'t have to teach the little kids as much so he was ok with it. \"I\\'m proud of you Troy I knew that you would make a good impression on them. Just think when they see that you are a triple threat that will make them want you even more.\" Said Sharpay attempting to hit the ball and missing. \"I know now I just need to keep my grades up next year. I know I did ok this year but I need to be better next year they hinted that a scholarship isn\\'t based just on my skills in basketball but it also depends on grades.\" Said Troy. \"You can do it though. I also don\\'t blame them. They know that players need to maintain a certain GPA to play and just because they are good doesn\\'t mean they will make the grades. Players need to be both good and smart. I know East High used to have a policy like that but then Mr. Matsui dropped it when he became principal. You used to have to have a minimum GPA to participate in any after school activities and sports. I think it sorts out the strong from the weak.\" Said Sharpay. \"Yeah I guess that makes since, I\\'m just going to really have to hit the books this year.\" Said Troy. \"If you need a study partner you know where to find me. I\\'m not the top of our class but I am in the top 10 percent. I can help you.\" Said Sharpay. \"Really? That would be great! Thanks Sharpay. We\\'ll have to make a date of it when school starts again.\" Said Troy. \"I would like that Troy.\" Said Sharpay. They then went back to the lesson Sharpay pretending less and less that she was terrible. As the days went on Troy and Sharpay continued to practice every day and every day after practice they would go to dinner either at the club, out at a restaurant or a fast food place, and sometimes she would even join Troy and his parents for dinner at his house. She was becoming a regular fixture at the Bolton\\'s house. One night after dinner Troy was shooting hoops and Sharpay was watching him. \"Want to try?\" asked Troy when he saw Sharpay watching?\" \"I\\'m not very good\" she said standing up and taking off her sandals. Troy gave her the ball and she began to dribble. As she got a feel for the ball she shot a basket, Troy thought that it wouldn\\'t make it as she was at the three point line but he was shocked when it went in with nothing but net. He turned to look at her with a shocked look on his face and all he saw was a grin. \"You can play?\" he asked her. \"I guess I can I mean I did play for the Hawks a girls travel league for four years until I was beginning to get the leads in musicals and my time was taken up by rehearsals. Just like Ryan played baseball for a travel team as the pitcher and made it all the way to the little league World Series New Port Rhode Island but the same thing happened he started getting the leads with me and our rehearsals took up our time. So let\\'s play Bolton\" said Sharpay running for the ball. Troy realized that this was a challenge and ran after her. She made it to the ball before him and the game was on. At some point during the game Mr. and Mrs. Bolton had come to the backdoor and were watching the two play. \"I didn\\'t know Sharpay could play basketball.\" Said Mrs. Bolton \"Neither did I. I\\'ve never had her in a gym class but if I had seen her play before I would have had her put on the girls team. She\\'s good enough to take them all the way.\" Said Coach Bolton thinking about how he could get Sharpay on the girl\\'s team. \"Why do you think she could lead them all the way to a championship?\" asked his wife. \"If she\\'s able to hold her own and by the looks of how it\\'s going to end, win against Troy when he\\'s playing his hardest. Trust me Troy isn\\'t letting her win he might have started out that way but now he\\'s playing to win now.\" Said Mr. Bolton. \"Oh\" said Mrs. Bolton as they turned to continue to watch the two play. Back outside Troy and Sharpay were both working up a sweat? The game was tied 20-20 and the next point won. \"Next point wins\" said Troy. \"You\\'re on Bolton\" said Sharpay who had possession of the ball. She started to fake left then took off towards the right and went to do a layup. Troy had fallen for it and was in shock she had beaten him. \"Wow. Good game.\" Said Troy. \"Thanks Bolton, you didn\\'t do so bad yourself\" said Sharpay laughing. \"Oh I didn\\'t do so badly did I, we\\'ll see about that Evans.\" Said Troy taking off towards her to tickle her. He chased her around the yard and when he caught up to her he ended up grabbing her around her waist and lifting her up. She screamed a little then he began to tickle her, they were just goofing off but then something changed. They both realized how close they were to each other. Sharpay looked up at Troy while he looked down at her. He slowly leaned in and kissed her, it took her a minute or so to realize that it wasn\\'t a dream that Troy was really kissing her before she reciprocated. They ended up kissing for a few minutes before they broke apart. \"Wow\" said Troy \"Wow\" said Sharpay. They both just looked at each other and smiled. \"What does this mean?\" asked Sharpay. \"I..look Sharpay I know that I just broke up with Gabriella a few days ago but I like you. I would like to go out with you. But I don\\'t know how you feel? So it\\'s up to you.\" Said Troy. \"Troy. I\\'ve liked you since freshmen year and I\\'ve tried to get your attention since then. So yes I would like to go out with you.\" Said Sharpay smiling up at him. \"Well that\\'s good. How about dinner tomorrow night after I get out of work. Just the two of us?\" asked Troy. \"I would like that very much.\" Said Sharpay kissing him gently on his cheek. The moment was interrupted when Troy\\'s mom came out into the yard. \"Sharpay your cell phone is ringing.\" She said as she walked over to hand the phone to Sharpay. Sharpay took the phone and stepped away from the two to answer. \"So I guess Sharpay is going to be a more permanent fixture around here\" said Mrs. Bolton looking towards her son. \"Yea she will. I\\'m taking her to dinner tomorrow after work for our first official date.\" Said Troy looking at his mom then back to Sharpay who was on the phone with her back turned to them. \"I\\'m glad your happy Troy and I like her I think she\\'s good for you. She can even give you a run for your money in basketball.\" She said laughing. \"Yeah she can. She could be on the girls team and help lead them to victory if she really wanted too.\" Said Troy. His mom laughed even more \"Your dad said the same thing earlier.\" They were interrupted by Sharpay coming back over to the pair. \"I\\'m sorry about that it was my mom her and my dad are back in town from their trip to New York and they were wondering where I was. They want me back home before it gets to late. They don\\'t like me driving late at night.\" Said Sharpay. \"Oh honey I understand I don\\'t like Troy out late driving. Would you like Jack or I to run you home and you can pick up your car tomorrow?\" asked Mrs. Bolton she hadn\\'t even realized that it was late but it was 10:30 and she could understand the Evans\\'s worry. \"I wouldn\\'t want to be a bother. I\\'ll just drive home.\" Said Sharpay. \"It\\'s not a problem I promise I would feel better about it myself. I\\'ll even drive you home. \" Said Mrs. Bolton. She turned around and headed to get her keys. \"Well I guess your mom is taking me home. I guess I\\'ll pick up my car tomorrow? I\\'ll have Ryan run me over before we head to the club.\" said Sharpay. \"O.K. or I could even drive your car to work tomorrow. It\\'s just when we go on our date we\\'ll have to take your car instead of my truck.\" Said Troy. \"Oh that would work. I didn\\'t even think of that. I\\'ll just ride to the club with Ryan tomorrow and I\\'ll let the parking staff know that you will be driving my car tomorrow and to just park it in its normal parking spot.\" Said Sharpay. \"O.k. so I\\'ll see you tomorrow then.\" Said Troy kissing Sharpay quickly while his mom stood at the backdoor waiting for Sharpay.'][Chapter 7] ['Chapter 7 The next day Troy was given some strange looks by his co-workers when he drove up in Sharpay\\'s pink convertible. He joked with Mark who was one of the valets that he had gotten a pink convertible instead of a red because pink was his favorite color and was great for his skin tone. He had heard Sharpay say that many times to different people when talking about her car. Troy then went to the locker room, changed and started his day. He was in the middle of a lesson with a group of 7 year olds when he was interrupted by Ryan. \"Hey Troy can I talk to you for a minute?\" asked Ryan. \"Uh…Sure, hold on one minute.\" Said Troy he turned back to the kids and told them to practice hitting the ball and he would be watching and would be back with them in a minute. When they were all set up and practicing he walked over to Ryan and they moved further away from the group. \"Look Troy Sharpay mentioned that you and her are going out tonight on a date. I know that you just broke up with Gabriella, it\\'s all over the gossip channels of east high but I need to know that you aren\\'t just leading my sister along just to end up going back to Gabriella in a few weeks. Please if that is what is going to happen don\\'t take my sister out tonight. I don\\'t think she could handle the heartbreak if that happened.\" Said Ryan looking to Troy. \"Look Ryan I know I just broke up with Gabriella not too long ago but I really like your sister. She and I already had a conversation like this. We both have feelings for one another and are going out tonight. Can I promise that I will never hurt Sharpay? No I can\\'t because I\\'ll probably end up doing or saying something stupid without knowing it like that pink isn\\'t the color of the year or something stupid like that. Can I promise that I won\\'t intentionally hurt her? Yes I can. Ryan look man I know that you are just watching out for your sister I get it I would too if I had a sister. But I promise I\\'m not doing this as some sort of revenge thing to get back at Gabriella. I actually really like your sister. We have been spending a lot of time together practicing for the talent show and I really like the Sharpay I see now. So are we good?\" asked Troy. \"Yeah we\\'re good I didn\\'t really think that you would intentionally hurt her but I have to check. She\\'s been hurt one to many times and I feel like I have to protect her.\" Said Ryan. \"I get it if I had a sister I would be the same way. So are we good?\" Said Troy. \"Yeah man were good.\" Said Ryan holding out his hand to Troy to shake which he did. Troy was then able to get back to work and he watched time literally fly away and before he knew it, it was time to change and get ready for his date with Sharpay. He had packed a nice change of clothes to wear, He chose a pair of dress khakis and a nice white long sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows and he finished off the outfit with a pair of tan Sperry\\'s. Since he had started hanging out with Sharpay plus his job he had understood much better how to dress to be casual but without looking to casual. After getting changed and checking his hair in the mirror one last time he went to meet Sharpay in the lobby. He had made a reservation at the restaurant on his lunch break for the two of them. He knew that she loved the food at the restaurant and it was nice enough but at the same time still kind of casual for the two of them. When he made it to the lobby he had to stop short as he got a clear look at Sharpay. It was the first time he had seen her today and she looked beautiful. She was wearing a white summer dress that ended at her knees with a pair of white wedges. He slowly walked up to her. \"Wow Sharpay you look…wow\" said Troy at a loss for words. \"Thanks.\" Said Sharpay tucking some of her blonde hair behind her ear. Troy grabbed her hand and led her to the dining room. After having the dinner Troy look her on a walk around the club. He loved how it looked at night with the pathways all lite up and how the lights reflected off of Sharpay\\'s hair. As they were nearing the end of the path where they could see Sharpay\\'s car parked in her spot Troy said \"Sharpay I had a great time tonight.\" Said Troy. \"So did I.\" said Sharpay looking up at him. \"I hope we can do this again? I know I would like to.\" Said Troy touching her check softly. \"I would like that a lot Troy.\" Said Sharpay. Troy smiled and started to lean in to kiss her but before he did he looked into her eyes to make sure that he was reading the symbols correctly before kissing her slowly. After a few minutes they separated both looking a little out of breath. Troy smiled at her and took her hand again and led her to her car. He opened her car door for her and closed it after she had slid in. She started her car up and rolled down the window. \"I guess I will see you tomorrow?\" asked Sharpay. \"You will. Text me and let me know that you made it home alright please? Next time we go out I\\'ll do it right and come pick you up and take you home.\" Said Troy smiling. He leaned down and through the window kissed her gently again. Afterwards Sharpay smiled and blew him a kiss as she rolled up the window and began to back up. Troy watched her drive away until he couldn\\'t see her anymore. Then he headed to the staff parking lot where his parents had dropped his truck off so he had a way home after the date without having to call them. When he got home his parents were already in bed. So he showered and fell into his bed fast asleep dreaming of Sharpay.'][Chapter 8] ['Chapter 8 The next few weeks flew by he played hoops with the guys occasionally but he never brought up Sharpay and neither did the guys he also didn\\'t tell them about singing at the talent show with her. He decided he just didn\\'t want to hear his friends complain that he was dating Sharpay or that he was singing in a show again. He knew that eventually he would have to tell them that he was dating Sharpay but he for now he wanted to keep Sharpay to himself. After he was done with the show he would tell the guys about Sharpay. The show was only a few days away now and Sharpay and he had been practicing during all of their free time. Their performance was good and he knew that they would win for sure. Ryan was their choreographer and had come up with some moves that they both could do that were just natural. Sharpay had picked out Troy\\'s outfit and he was wearing khaki dress pants and a light blue shirt and brown loafers but he had no idea what Sharpay was wearing she told him that it was going to be a surprise the night of the performance. That night after his and Sharpay\\'s rehearsal Troy drove Sharpay home in his truck. Thanks to his new job he was able to fix his truck up even more with his dad and get some embellishments for the inside like seat covers that looked nicer and were much more comfortable to sit on. He also had a wildcat\\'s talisman from a middle school graduation cap hanging off of his review mirror thanks to Sharpay. Also thanks to Sharpay he had a picture of them tucked into the sun visor. When Sharpay had first seen his truck she wasn\\'t too happy with it compared to her car even though she didn\\'t say it out loud he could tell so he took her to the car shop and asked her to pick some things for the interior that she liked and she had jumped at the chance. Troy also let her have control of the music selection in his truck while he had a lot of CD\\'s she liked he also had an iPod cord so she could plug her iPod in. \"I think we\\'re doing great Troy. The Star Dazzle Award is ours.\" Said Sharpay looking over at Troy. Troy glanced over quickly smiled at her before turning back to the road. \"I know we will win\" said Troy just as he pulled into her driveway. He remembered the first time he had come to her house and how shocked he was to see the size of it. When he pulled up to the front door he quickly got out and ran to the passenger side to open the door for Sharpay \"My Lady\" said Troy bowing dramatically and holding out his hand for her. She took it while laughing. He escorted her to the door, the lights were on which meant that her parents were home from their business trip which meant he had to say goodbye to her at the door. \"I guess this is where I have to tell you goodbye huh?\" asked Troy as they got to the front door. \"Yes it is. I wish you could come in but Daddy is still getting used to the idea of you and me being a couple. He is coming around just give him some time I am his princess.\" Said Sharpay. \"I get it. You\\'ve seen how protective my mom is of me. She loves you though by the way she says you are way better for me then Gabriella ever was for me. She says you bring out the best side of me. Also I think you two both bonded over how much you disliked Gabriella. Now my dad was set to dislike you but then he saw you and me play basketball and how good you are and decided that he needed to give you a second chance and forget about the gossip he\\'s heard around school.\" Said Troy smiling at her. He liked how his parents liked Sharpay it made bringing her over to the house so much easier. When he was with Gabriella he always went to her house because his parents while they didn\\'t say it out loud didn\\'t approve of Gabriella. He knew his mom had on more than one occasion said how he had changed since he had started seeing her and his dad had made a few comments about dating her here and there. He liked how they loved Sharpay and got a long so well. He smiled at Sharpay again and slowly leaned in to give her a good night kiss. Afterwards she said \"I guess I\\'ll see you tomorrow at the club and at dress rehearsal. Night Troy.\" Said Sharpay leaning up and quickly kissing him again before going into the house. Troy smiled after her and slowly made his way back to his truck to head home. The next day Troy went to work gave some lessons and was a caddy for Mr. Smith who was a member and was on the school board and wanted to congratulate Troy on a wildcat victory. He found being a caddy again to be fun he was able to give tips and enjoy the game being played without having to watch for flying clubs or golf balls like he had to when he worked with kids. After he was finished he was on his way to the kitchen to grab a bite to eat before his next lesson when he was stopped by Mr. Evans. \"Ah Troy just the man I was looking for. Come walk with me.\" He said putting an arm around Troy\\'s shoulders and guiding him outside and through the path. \"Now Troy I know you have been seeing my princess and I feel its time we had a chat man to man you know how it is.\" \"Yes sir\" said Troy looking at Mr. Evans. \"I want to know what your intentions are with Sharpay. I want to make sure that you aren\\'t just with her because of our money or what she can give you. I know this summer has been very generous for you with the job and such but I\\'ve had other members singing your praises which is why I told Fulton to promote you. Now Troy why are you dating my daughter?\" asked Mr. Evans. \"With all due respect sir I like Sharpay. If I\\'m being honest I\\'ve liked Sharpay since last year but it\\'s just taken us this long to get here. I like how I can just be myself with her and I feel like she can just be herself around me. We play basketball which I love and I know even though she complains about being sweaty and gross afterwards I only see her smile that big after rehearsing for a show. I also love how dedicated she is to singing and how she wants to make sure that every show is perfect. I appreciate all that your family has done for me but all of that has nothing to do with my relationship with Sharpay and if I have to give it all up to continue to see her then I will. I really do just love Sharpay for Sharpay from the way she bites her lip when she\\'s nervous to the way she scrunches her nose when she doesn\\'t like an idea but won\\'t say that she doesn\\'t like it.\" Said Troy looking to see Mr. Evans reaction. \"Troy. I don\\'t want you to give up anything here. I think you\\'re doing a great job here. I also think you are a good match for Sharpay. I approve of your relationship with her. I had to check and make sure you were with her for the right reasons. I\\'ve had other young men try to date Sharpay just because of our money or the connections that I hold. Can you fault a man for protecting his only daughter?\" said Mr. Evans. \"No sir I can\\'t blame you I know my mom had the same talk with Sharpay one night when she drove her home. I hope this means that I can continue to see Sharpay with your blessing though sir.\" Said Troy. \"Yes it does, come let\\'s get back I have to meet the family for lunch which you\\'re more than welcome to join us for.\" \"Thank you sir I would love to join you.\" Said Troy shaking the man\\'s hand and following him back into the club dining room. When they entered the dining room they found Ryan, Mrs. Evans and Sharpay already seated at a table chatting, they hadn\\'t noticed that they had arrived yet. Troy snuck up behind Sharpay as she was busy talking to her mom about the new spa treatments \"Guess who?\" he asked as he covered her eyes with his hands. \"Hmm let me see I think Johnny Depp?\" said Sharpay with a laugh. \"Nope guess again.\" Said Troy laughing now while the rest of the family watched the two. \"Well if it\\'s not Johnny Depp I guess I\\'ll have to go with my boyfriend.\" Said Sharpay. \"You would be correct it is your incredibly handsome boyfriend.\" Said Troy taking his hands away and kissing Sharpay on the check before taking a seat next to her. She just laughed as they continued on with their lunch. What they didn\\'t know is that someone had taken a picture of Troy and Sharpay and had sent it to a few other wildcats. 4'][Chapter 9] ['Chapter 9: That night just as Troy was just pulling in when he noticed a bunch of the guys were just coming up to his lawn after getting out of Chad\\'s moms car. \"Hey guys what\\'s up this is a little late to be shooting some hoops do you think we can reschedule for tomorrow I\\'m off all day and can play then.\" Said Troy rolling his shoulders back to ease some of the tension in them. \"Dude what the hell!\" exclaimed Chad looking pissed off. Troy just looked at him with a confused look. \"Your dating the ice queen now? What they hell? What about Gabriella? I know you guys broke up but we figured you would get back together in a few weeks I know that\\'s what the girls think that you just needed some time to cool off from the fight before getting back together. Now Taylor and Kelsi are over trying to console Gabriella. Not cool man.\" Said Chad pacing the front yard before stopping in front of Troy. \"O.k. first of all I told you weeks ago that Gabriella and I were done so I don\\'t know why any of you held out hope over us getting back together. Second so what if I\\'m dating Sharpay? I like her a lot I\\'ve seen a whole new side of her this summer and were good together. Plus I don\\'t see how this would affect any one of you. Then lastly its not my problem that Gabriella is upset she knew we were over and I have told you and others including her that we were through so I\\'m not a bad guy here for dating Sharpay.\" Said Troy getting defensive. He knew his friends weren\\'t going to like his dating Sharpay but he also wasn\\'t prepared for the hate he was receiving. \"Dude she\\'s the ice queen what could you possibly see in her? Plus did you not think about how this would affect us Jason is dating Kelsi and I\\'m dating Taylor Gabriella\\'s two best friends in the world how are we all supposed to hang out with one another? Are you going to bring the ice queen around Gabriella? Do you really think that would go over well?\" asked Chad. Now Troy was getting angry. \"Don\\'t call her ice queen! Do you see me calling Taylor the science geek or Kelsi the Music nerd no so lay off Sharpay. Second its not my problem if your girlfriends are pissed that I\\'m dating Sharpay. If they don\\'t want to be around us that\\'s fine. I\\'ve come to realize that I only want people who support me around. So if that\\'s not them or any of you then that\\'s fine. Now I\\'m going inside before any of us say something that we\\'ll come to regret. But I will say this if you can\\'t make an effort with Sharpay or at least be nice then don\\'t come around. If you decide you can give Sharpay a try let me know otherwise I\\'ll see you when school starts in three weeks.\" Said Troy giving each of them a look before heading inside leaving the guys standing on the front lawn. When Troy got inside and up to his room he texted Sharpay to let her know what had gone on when he got home. She had said how Ryan had shown her a picture that had been texted to him showing Troy kissing Sharpay\\'s cheek from lunch today asking if Troy was dating Sharpay. She was trying to figure out who had seen them as Kelsi wasn\\'t working that night so she wasn\\'t in the dinning room. Plus the picture had the piano in the background. As she was trying to figure it out Troy told her he didn\\'t care that it was out that now it meant that it would hopefully die down in the gossip department by the time school started in three weeks. After a few more texts back and forth trying to figure out who had taken the picture they called it a night they both needed there rest tomorrow night was the dress rehearsal for the star dazzle award show which would take place on Saturday night. Troy had been given tomorrow off but he and Sharpay had made plans to rehearse all day before the dress rehearsal. He knew they were great but he also knew that Sharpay was still nervous and liked to make sure everything would go perfect. The next day\\'s rehearsals flew by and the dress rehearsal just made them feel even more confident as they were able to see the other acts including Mrs. Hoffenfeffer\\'s sock puppets which made them have to hold in there laughter. By the time Saturday night rolled around Troy and Sharpay felt confident in there performance and Troy wasn\\'t nervous. Troy and Sharpay were hanging out backstage in one of the dressing rooms. They could hear the other acts going on but they would be the last ones. Sharpay was working on her breathing exercises and pacing the floor. \"Sharpay, clam down we have this. Take a deep breath. Look at me just look at me when we go out on stage just look at me and we\\'ll sing just like we have been rehearsing for weeks now o.k.?\" \"O.k. your right we can do this we don\\'t need to worry. There isn\\'t anything to worry about so there is no need to be nervous.\" \"I didn\\'t think you got nervous before going on stage. Anytime I\\'ve seen you on stage your calm and you shine.\" Said Troy looking at her. \"I\\'ve always had bad stage fright. Usually I end up either hyperventilating and Ryan has to calm me down or I end up throwing up in a bucket backstage before going on stage. I love being on the stage but getting up the nerve to go out on the stage and shine knowing that if you make the smallest mistake it can ruin the whole scene or the whole performance. So thank you for calming me down.\" Said Sharpay looking into Troy\\'s eyes. \"For you anytime.\" Said Troy kissing her on her forehead before they hear Mr. Fulton say that they were on next. Troy looked at her and said \"Remember just look at me if you get nervous. I\\'ll be right on stage with you every step of the way.\" Said Troy taking her hand and leading her to the stair that they would use. Sharpay looked at him and squeezed his hand before taking the microphone that was handed to her by one of the stage hands and heading up to the stage when Mr. Fulton announced her and Troy. Troy followed just a few seconds later before the music started to play. Sharpay: Na na na na Na na na na na, yeah You are the music in me You know the words \"once upon a time\" Make you listen, there\\'s a reason When you dream there\\'s a chance you\\'ll find A little laugher, or happy ever after Troy and Sharpay: You\\'re a harmony to the melody That\\'s echoing inside my head Sharpay: A single voice Troy: Single voice Sharpay: Above the noise Both: And like a common thread Troy: Hmm, you\\'re pulling me Sharpay: When I hear my favorite song I know that we belong Troy: Oh, you are the music in me Yeah, it\\'s living in all of us Sharpay: And it\\'s brought us here because Both: Because you are the music in me Na na na na (oh) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me Sharpay: It\\'s like I knew you before we met (before we met) Can\\'t explain it (uh-huh) There\\'s no name for it (no name for it) Both: I sang you words I\\'ve never said Troy: And it was easy (so easy) Because you see the real me (I see) Both: As I am you understand (us) And that\\'s more than I\\'ve ever known Sharpay: To hear your voice Troy: Hear your voice Sharpay: Above the noise (oh) Both: And I know that I\\'m alone Sharpay: Oh, you\\'re singing to me Troy: Ooh, yeah Both: When I hear my favorite song I know that we belong (yeah, oh) You are the music in me It\\'s living in all of us And it\\'s brought us here because Because you are the music in me Together we\\'re gonna sing, yeah We got the power to say what we feel (what we feel) Troy: Connected and real Sharpay: Can\\'t keep it all inside, oh yeah Troy: Ooh, yeah Na na na na (oh yeah) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me Na na na na (oh yeah) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me All: When I hear my favorite song (favorite song) I know that we belong (we belong) Oh, you are the music in me Troy: Yeah Both: It\\'s living in all of us It\\'s brought us here because (here because) You are the music in me Na na na na (oh yeah) Na na na na (yeah yeah yeah) Na na na na You are the music in me Troy: Yeah (whoo) Afterwards they both took a bow and they held hands as they walked off stage to await the results with the other contestants. \"We did it Sharpay we were amamzing.\" Said Troy giving her a side hug. \"I don\\'t know Troy I messed up some of Ryan\\'s steps. I just know that they judges are going to give us second because of my mistakes.\" Said Sharpay starting to have a freak out. \"Hey hey calm down look at me. You didn\\'t mess up and even if you did it won\\'t matter we did our absolute best and we had fun on that stage. No matter what place we get it will all be ok because we still have each other.\" Said Troy. \"O.k. it\\'ll all be o.k.\" said Sharpay smiling at him. It was then that they heard Mr. Fulton call out there names for first place. Sharpay quickly turned to Troy and hugged him and quickly kissed him on the lips before taking his hand and together walking up on stage. Troy took the microphone while Sharpay took the trophy. \"There is one more person who needs to be on this stage with us and that is our choreographer and coach Mr. Ryan Evans. Come on up here Ryan we wouldn\\'t have made it this far without you.\" Said Troy motioning for Ryan to join him as the crowd began to applaud. Ryan made it up on stage and Sharpay handed over the trophy to him before putting an arm around Troy and leaning into him. Ryan took a quick bow before the trio made there way off the stage to meet their parents. There two families each wanted pictures of the trio with the trophy as well as Troy and Sharpay with the trophy and Sharpay and Ryan with the trophy. After pictures were done everyone made there way back to the table to finish dinner. That night when Troy got home he changed his cell phone screen to the picture of Sharpay and him singing on stage that his mom had taken tonight. He looked over at his end table and looked at the picture of him and Sharpay taken on one of their previous dates. He hadn\\'t expected the summer to go this way when school let out eight weeks ago but he was glad that everything had gone the way it did. He wouldn\\'t change it for the world. He couldn\\'t wait to see what senior year had in store for him. He knew that whatever was thrown at him he could handle it as long as Sharpay is by his side. Here is where I end this story. I am trying to decide if I should do a sequel or not. It has been rough writing this story and while it was hard it was also very therapeutic to write it and for others to read it. I hope that you all enjoyed this story but this is where I end it. If I decide to write a sequel I will post a chapter on here letting you know before posting the new story.']","Summary":" ['Hi everyone, I know that I\\'ve never written a High School Musical Fan Fiction, but three months"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"Closer","Author":"Luriana","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13203569","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['The way they roll Apretó el botón de apagado de su automóvil y echó su cabeza para atrás. Había sido una semana pesada en el trabajo, de hecho, recién había terminado una llamada y ya eran las 10 de la noche. Hacia aproximadamente 6 años que se había graduado y no recordaba un día que no fuera así. Tomó su abrigo ya que afuera nevaba, dudó 1 minuto antes de salir y cuando por fin se decidió corrió hacia la puerta de su casa que era alumbrada por cientos de luces navideñas, buscó las llaves en su bolsa e ignoró el celular que sonaba nuevamente. No dio tiempo de encontrarlas dado que su madre abrió inmediatamente. —Pasa, te estas congelando. Su casa olía a galletas recién horneadas, lo cual se traducía a que la Navidad estaba cerca lo que la hizo recordar de repente no había comprado los regalos. —¿Qué tal tu día? ¿Ya arreglaste todo para tus vacaciones en Albuquerque? —preguntó su madre sacando las galletas del horno. Gabriella tomó una y suspiró. —Mamá, no pediré permiso para ir a Albuquerque a una reunión de ex alumnos. El teléfono de Gabriella volvió a sonar, no le gustaba interrumpir las pláticas con su madre y menos si de trabajo se trataba, sin embargo, al no contestar vio la notificación de What\\'s app. \"Contéstame\" Su amiga Taylor insistía en el teléfono, vivía en Washington con Chad, sorprendentemente, a diferencia de lo que todos creían en la preparatoria, ellos dos terminaron juntos. Fue la única pareja que pudo sobrevivir a las distancias y los años, aunque todavía no sabía muy bien como había pasado eso. Pero él era basquetbolista profesional, mientras que Taylor trabajaba para el gobierno estatal. —¿Quién es? —preguntó Lisa sentándose junto a su hija. —Es Taylor, me ha llamado todo el día, pero no he podido contestarle. Creo iré a mi habitación. La madre de Gabriella sonrió y la vio irse a su habitación. —Piensa lo de Albuquerque—le gritó cuando se alejaba. Gabriella sonrió tras cerrar la puerta de su habitación su madre siempre había sido su cómplice y confidente, además siempre sabía mejor que ella que era lo que quería. Pero ir a Albuquerque ni siquiera estaba considerado. Se cambió las zapatillas por unas pantuflas y espero después de su llamada para ponerse el pijama. Tomó su celular, suspiró e inició la llamada con Taylor, sin embargo, esta al contestar cambio el modo a Video llamada. Del otro lado del teléfono se veía a una morena maquillada, usando un traje con una sonrisa en el rostro. —Hola, Tay. —¿Cuándo vuelas a Albuquerque? —preguntó directo la morena sin saludar. Gabriella se rascó la ceja. —No iré a Albuquerque. Taylor. —¿Cómo que no iras? La imagen de Taylor cambió a la de dos personas, Chad usaba una camiseta blanca y comía un helado directo del envase, —Hola Gab—saludó junto a un gesto con la mano. —Hola Chad. —Dice que no irá a Albuquerque—le dijo Taylor a su pareja. —¿Cómo que no iras? Tienes que ir—se alteró el basquetbolista— Eres importante para todos, sin ti Tay y yo no estaríamos juntos. Gabriela sonrió al ver como Chad besaba en la mejilla a su novia. —SI lo estarían, sólo era cuestión de tiempo. —No cambies el tema Gabriella—la reprendió Taylor—¿por qué no irás? La mencionada suspiró. —Porque tengo trabajo, no puedo pedir vacaciones. —Nadie tiene trabajo en estas fechas, ¿qué dices? —No quiero ir, Taylor, ¿para que recordar cosas si ahorita tengo una vida que me gusta? La morena rodó los ojos —Porque verás a tus amigos, a Kelsey, a Marta, a Ryan, a mí…—dijo la última palabra como si fuera lo más obvio. Gabriella sentía mucha presión por parte de su amiga, obvio recordaba a Kelsey, a Marta y a Ryan, pero no volaría tanto por verlos, si a veces los mandaba saludar en Facebook. En cuanto a Taylor, se veían 2 veces al año y ya lo habían hecho en el que transcurría. —Gabriella ya, también Kelsey y Ryan terminaron e irán sin ningún problema—intervino Chad sentándose junto a Taylor, pero al escuchar lo que dijo esta le dio un golpe en la pierna. —No es por Troy…—se apresuró a decir la muchacha. —Claro que no querida—sonrió Taylor—además él no irá, está montando Grease… —Sí, con Sharpay he visto los espectaculares. —Y una Rizzo que se parece mucho a ti—sonrió Chad. —Mi vida, ¿por qué no vas a poner la mesa para cenar? Chad se levantó rodando los ojos, pero dándole un beso en la mejilla a su novia, Gabriella sonrió al ver esa escena. —Me alegra verlos tan felices. Taylor sonrió —Es un tonto, pero alegra mis noches cada que llego de la oficina. ¿Y tú? ¿Algún novio escondido? —Sabes que no formalmente, te contaré de inmediato cuando conozca a alguien especial, sigues siendo mi mejor amiga. —Eso espero, Montez—apuntó con el dedo a través de la pantalla—también espero, que colgando hagas tu maleta para Albuquerque—Gabriella hizo cara de desagrado—anda, será divertido, podemos quedarnos una semana y rentar una casa para los tres, incluso puedo decirle a Marta. Di que sí. —Hablaré mañana con mi jefe.. —¡Súper! —gritó Taylor interrumpiendo a su amiga —Pero no aseguro que me den permiso, es la siguiente semana. —Yo sé que sí te darán, eres la mejor abogada de tu empresa. Gabriela rodó los ojos. —Te aviso, Taylor —No nos falles Gabriella, seguimos siendo un equipo. Antes de colgar, Gabriella escuchó como Taylor le decía a Chad que sí la había convencido. Se recostó sobre su cama y abrazó su almohada preguntándose si haría bien en volver a East High, habían pasado 10 años desde su graduación, de ese día que montaron el último musical, cuando Troy fue a buscarla y ambos creyeron que eso podría durar para siempre, que equivocados estaban al creer que un amor de juventud podría durar toda la vida. Llevaba 5 años soltera, el primer año fue el más difícil porque después de estar un lustro con Troy hacer las cosas sin él le parecían una locura, pero finalmente lo había logrado, por eso tenía tanto miedo de volver al lugar donde todo empezó pero si Chad y Troy tenían razón y él no estaba ahí, tal vez se podría divertir como cuando tenía 17 años. Sonrió, tomó su celular y aun sabiendo que era tarde le llamó a su jefa para explicarle que le había salido un compromiso en Albuquerque, se iría la semana siguiente pero tenía que comprar el boleto de avión ya por eso de la temporada decembrina, su jefa no puso traba alguna sólo le pidió dejará todo terminado y a una persona encargada de todo en su ausencia. Fue más fácil de lo que ella pensaba. Le gritó a su mamá que Taylor la había convencido de ir a East High, así que enseguida cotizó un vuelo de Illinois a Albuquerque. … Los aplausos del público resonaban por todo el teatro, los actores se tomaban de las manos y sonreían. Por eso todo valía la pena, los ensayos, las desveladas, las giras. Desde el escenario veían como la gente se ponía de pie y recibían las flores lanzadas por las primeras filas. Todos se inclinaron una vez más y el telón cayó dejando a los actores sonrientes ocultos del público. —¡Lo hicimos! — exclamó una mujer de cabello negro y chocó palmas con Sharpay—Troy estuviste excelente. —Gracias Camilla—sonrió Troy —¿Nos vemos después? Troy asintió y vio a su compañera irse, después de eso recibió a Sharpay en un abrazo. —¡Estuvimos excelentes! —Sonrió Sharpay con un brillo en los ojos más allá de la diamantina que tenía alrededor—Una vez más. —Es increíble todo esto, nunca pensé estar aquí. —Pero estas y eres muy bueno. Comenzaron a caminar hacía sus camerinos. —Igual eras muy bueno en basquetbol, como Chad que según sé el año pasado ganó un trofeo de algo ¿no? —Sí, mejor jugador de la temporada. —Anda eso, hablando de Chad, ¿Te ha dicho algo de la reunión de East High? Llegaron a los camerinos y saludaron a todo el equipo que pasaba por su lado. —Sí, pero le dije que no iría, que teníamos muchas fechas de presentación. Sharpay lo miró extrañada mientras abría la puerta de su camerino. —¿Bromeas? Acabamos hoy y no nos volvemos a presentar hasta enero. Al entrar al camerino un hombre con flores sonreía frente a los actores. —¡Joe! —gritó Sharpay y se lanzó a los brazos de su novio cubriéndole la cara de besos y dejándolo con maquillaje. — ¿Cuándo volviste? —Justo antes de la función, estuviste increíble como siempre. Hola Troy. El mencionado saludó con la mano desde el marco de la puerta. —Que gusto verte Joe. —¿Cuándo vuelan a Albuquerque? —preguntó el novio de Sharpay. —Dice Troy que él no ira, ¿puedes creerlo? —comentó la rubia poniendo flores en agua—Pero yo vuelo pasado mañana, ya hablé con Ryan y haremos una comida familiar en el club, ¿Estás seguro que no puedes venir amor, a mis papás les gustaría ver a la familia reunida? —Creo que ya tienen que hablar de sus cosas, nos vemos después—se despidió Troy. —Espera—lo detuvo su amiga—nos cambiamos y vamos los tres a cenar, ¿les parece? —Sin problema—respondió Joe que leía el programa de mano desde el sillón del camerino pero Troy hizo una mueca de desagrado—Anda Bolton, ya sabes que mí chica no le gustan los no por respuesta. —Hace mucho que no se ven y seguro quieren estar solos—advirtió Troy. —Pero tendremos toda la semana y posiblemente las fiestas—sonrió Joe. —¿Eso quiere decir si vas a Albuquerque conmigo? —brincó Sharpay de emoción. Su novio sólo sonrió y encogió los hombros, por lo que ella se lanzó nuevamente a llenarle la cara, de besos. —Entonces Troy, ¿cenamos? —al no recibir respuesta concluyó—listo nos vemos en media hora afuera del teatro. Troy no supo que responder, caminó hacia su camerino quitándose la chamarra de piel que tanto le pesaba. No quería ir de mal tercio una vez más, consideró seriamente invitar a Camilla quien lo saludó una vez más en el pasillo, pero intuía Sharpay quería hablar de East High así que se iba a sincerar con ella y no quería gente extraña, en cuanto a Joe también lo consideraba su amigo, era novio de Sharpay desde hacía 3años pero se habían conocido en la universidad, él se dedicaba a la pintura por lo que se la pasaba viajando para promocionar sus cuadros. Era curioso que su círculo de amigos fuera Sharpay y su novio, más después de que no congeniaban en la escuela. Cuando le contó a Chad este le dijo que no le sorprendía nada de él si había dejado el basquetbol por dedicarse al teatro, pero sorprendentemente Sharpay era una persona agradable, era una amiga leal que encontró por casualidad en sus primeros castings, a partir de ahí comenzaron a ser amigos y por obras del destino estaban montando Grease en Nueva York, así que si a alguien le tenía confianza era a ella. Pasó la media hora y como acordaron se vieron en la entrada del teatro para caminar rumbo al restaurant de enfrente. Joe y Sharpay caminaban abrazados mientras Troy no sacaba las manos del abrigo pues si lo hacía seguro acabarían congelándose. Entraron al restaurant y después de ordenar pizza y cerveza, Sharpay miró a Troy a los ojos. —¿Entonces? ¿Piensas pasar aquí las fiestas? —Posiblemente vengan mis papás incluso podría invitar a Chad y Taylor. Sharpay negó. —Ryan dijo Chad estará en Albuquerque y obviamente Taylor con él, verdad. —¿Es por esa chica, cierto? —Preguntó Joe—¿Gabriella? Troy miró a Sharpay quien inmediatamente dio un tragó a su cerveza. —Tranquilo, sabes que igual puedes confiar en mí. ¿Sigues enamorado de ella? —No lo sé, han pasado 5 años sin verla, no sé inclusive si ya se casó, si sigue viviendo en Estados Unidos, no sé nada de ella, no podría decir si estoy enamorado o no. —Troy tienes que dar vuelta a la página—sugirió Sharpay—según Ryan vive en Illinois, trabaja mucho y no confirmó asistencia para la reunión de ex alumnos, posiblemente no seamos dignos de su presencia—mordió la pizza—al fin de cuentas ella sólo fue lince un año o año y medio. Deberías ir con nosotros ¿no quisieras volver a ver a tu equipo? —Sharpay tiene razón, Troy. Según tengo entendido ustedes estuvieron en East High desde primaria, deberías volver a ver a tus amigos. Troy se recargó en la silla y suspiró. —De acuerdo, iré. —¡Si! —aplaudió Sharpay—será divertido. … Chad guardaba su ropa en la maleta que llevaría a Albuquerque cuando una notificación prendió su celular. \" Sharpay me convenció, nos vemos en Albuquerque\" —Oh por Dios. —¿Qué pasa? —preguntó Taylor saliendo del baño envuelta en una toalla. Chad le enseñó el mensaje y ambos se miraron. —Oh por Dios—repitió la morena—¿No tenían función? ¿Y ahora qué hacemos con Gabriella? —Querida, estamos en problemas. … ¡Hola! No sé si alguien este leyendo esto si sí me gustaría saber su opinión. Hace más de un año que no escribo así que el estrés de ser adulta me hizo querer volver a la adolescencia por lo que esta idea surgió de mi mente. Espero les haya gustado y si no, háganmelo saber. Gracias ~Luriana~'][Chapter 2] ['2. My inmortal Las puertas de East High se abrieron para que la generación de Troy Bolton disfrutara de una agradable tardeada en compañía de los que alguna vez fueron sus compañeros. Habían pasado 10 años desde que habían salido de ahí para ganarse un lugar en la universidad. Gabriella entró junto con Taylor, Marta, Kelsey y Chad. Como lo habían planeado, rentaron una casa cerca de la escuela que contaba con alberca, por lo que tuvieron una tarde anterior a esa muy relajada. El hombre mencionado vio a sus amigos y compañeros de equipos Zeke y Jason, los cuales se saludaron con mucha emoción y con algunos golpes en la espalda. —Hombres—rodó Taylor los ojos. Inmediatamente imitaron la acción de sus compañeros que tomaban cerveza en un vaso rojo. Junto a la mesa de bebidas había alimentos de todo tipo, embutidos, quesos, papas, algunos vegetales que podían ser sumergidos en humus, etc. El único de los Linces que se había dedicado al basquetbol era Chad, puesto que Zeke había puesto su restaurant y Jason tenía un consultorio pues al final había estudiado psicología, además que se había casado y pronto sería padre de una niña. Kelsey trabajaba en una disquera como compositora mientras que Marta era doctora y trabajaba en un hospital en Nueva Jersey. Entre los maestros caminaba Darbus, ya cansada, pero saludando a todos con mucha emoción. —¡Señorita Montez! —Saludó a Gabriella con un abrazo—¿Dónde está el señor Bolton? Un silencio incomodo se formó en el círculo de amigos que Darbus había roto. —Ya no estamos juntos, señora Darbus—confesó Gabriella con una sonrisa. —Oh, una lástima eran una pareja digna de enfrentar todo, oh Kelsey ¿Cómo va todo? Taylor notó como su amiga empezaba a sentirse incomoda por lo que se la llevó alejada de la multitud. —¿Todo bien? —preguntó recogiéndole un mechon de cabello de la frente. —Sabía que esto pasaría—asintió Gabriella—pero todo bien, es decir sólo ustedes superaron la universidad—soltó una risa. —Sí, no fue fácil eh—admitió Taylor. Gabriella sabía esa historia de memoria, incluso fue participe de varias acciones que hizo Chad para no perder a Taylor, Troy también contribuyó, una cosa más que hicieron juntos. Solían salir los 4 aunque Chad y Taylor acordaron no seguir juntos puesto que estudiaban muy lejos uno del otro, sin embargo cuando ambos se graduaron Chad los invitó a un partido y al ganar el equipo se arrodilló y se quitaron las playeras, debajo había letras que formaban un mensaje diciendo \"Taylor McKesey, ¿quieres ser mi novia?\", Taylor lloró y bajó a la cancha donde después de un beso a Chad, aceptó su propuesta. Desde ahí habían estado juntos. Las puertas de East High volvieron a abrirse y con entrada triunfal dio pasó a las celebridades de la escuela, las que lo fueron y seguían siendo por sus papeles principales en teatro, además del coreógrafo de varios artistas de Hollywood. Troy, Sharpay y Ryan entraron con lentes de sol, vestidos con ropas caras y caminando con porte elegante. Gabriella volteó a ver porqué toda la gente se acercaba a la entrada y a ver quién se abría paso entre la multitud regresó una mirada de desagrado a Taylor que a su vez miraba a Chad quien se acercaba rápidamente a ellas. —Dijeron que no vendrían La pareja de morenos se mordieron los labios. —¿Cuándo lo supieron? —quiso saber Gabriella—y no me mientan. —Días antes del vuelo. Gabriella suspiró y se alejó de ellos. … —Ups parece que sí vino—le comentó Sharpay al oído a Troy que se había quedado estático al ver a Gabriella. A Troy le había entrado un escalofrío en el cuerpo, no esperaba ver a Gabriella aunque a veces deseaba irla a buscar, el día que terminaron habían acordado en no verse nunca más y en 5 años lo habían cumplido. Sharpay notó la tensión de su amigo y acarició su espalda. —Ey, todo va a estar bien—sonrió la rubia—no te separes de nosotros y ya. —¡Bolton! —gritó Chad y se acercó a ellos en compañía de Zeke y Jason. —O claro también puedes estar con ellos—susurró en voz baja y fingió sonreír al verlos. —Sharpay—saludó Chad. La chica volteó en busca de ayuda por parte de Ryan pero este ya se encontraba a unos metros de distancia abrazando a Kelsey, Marta y Taylor. —Señora Darbus—gritó al ver su escape y fue tras ella. Los chicos empezaron a caminar por el pasillo hacia el gimnasio. —Sigo sin entender cómo puedes ser su amigo—confesó Chad. —Es agradable—comentó Troy. —Seguro—dijo sarcástico. Platicaron de todo lo que habían hecho en ese tiempo sin verse, sobretodo Zeke y Jason ya que Chad y Troy se veían muy seguido. Parecia increíble que al final Troy se hubiera decidido por el teatro, sobretodo porque estando en el gimnasio tomó un balón y comenzó a anotar canastas como hacía años. Quisieron jugar los cuatro sin embargo Chad prefirió descansar argumentando que la temporada estaba cerca y podría lastimarse, por lo que los tres amigos se rieron. —¿Qué? —se quejó Chad—No veo que ahorita Troy se ponga a cantar, ¿Cómo va esa canción? Jason, Zeke y Chad comenzaron a tarear la canción de \"Summer night\" —Tell me more, tell more—canto Zeke y los tres fingieron un baile en las gradas —Muy graciosos—se burló Troy. —¿O cómo es la otra canción? Oh ya sé, ya sé, Sandy uuh Sandy—imitó Chad. —Nunca me hubiera imaginado a Sharpay como Sandy Dee, ese papel debería de interpretarlo Gabriella—dijo Jason. La sonrisa de Troy se borró de repente, pero Chad cambió la conversación. —¿Y has tenido algo con Sharpay? —Preguntó Chad—ya sabes a lo que me refiero, con eso de que son pareja en Grease… —¡Okay! Fin de la conversación—paró Troy—volvamos por una cerveza. Chad abrazó a Troy por los hombros y lo sacó del gimnasio mientras que Zeke regañaba a Jason en silencio. Recorrieron la escuela, el pasillo de casilleros, el comedor y sonrieron, comenzaron a contar anécdotas. Pareciera como si eran los mismos jóvenes del equipo de basquetbol de algunos años atrás, a pesar de que la vida de todos ya era tan diferente. Quisieron regresar al vestíbulo, donde estaba la reunión llevándose a cabo, pero unas escaleras se interpusieron en el camino de Troy por lo que les dijo después los alcanzaría, encogiendo los hombros sus amigos no preguntaron más. … Ryan y Kelsey reían muchísimo. —¿Recuerdas cuando todo salió mal en nuestra primera fiesta en Julliard? —se reía el rubio. —Éramos un fracaso—lo acompaña Kelsey. Taylor y Marta veían la escena y les parecía ilógico que hubieran terminado si se seguían llevando tan bien, pero ellas no entendían la vida de los artistas, ni querían hacerlo, les parecía muy complicada. A ese grupo se unieron Zeke, Jason y Chad. —¿Dónde estabas? —preguntó Taylor molesta a este último—¿Dónde está Troy? —Fuimos al gimnasio a lanzar tiros, Troy no sé a dónde se fue, dijo que nos veía aquí. —Seguro a tener sexo con Sharpay en algún baño—contestó Taylor molesta. —Oye no, ellos no están juntos—intervino Ryan que nadie supo en que momento había llegado junto con Kelsey. —¿Y por qué llegaron juntos? —quiso saber Marta. —Porque trabajan juntos—respondió como si fuera lo más obvio del mundo—son amigos, Sharpay prácticamente está comprometida con Joe. —¿Quién es Joe? —quiso saber Zeke. —Mi novio—dijo una voz femenina detrás del grupo de amigos. Dando pasos largos se acercó a ellos, sus tacones resonaban por todo el salón. —Y no querida, no tendría sexo en el baño con Troy—aclaró Sharpay sonriendo—para eso tenemos habitaciones lujosas en cada gira que vamos. Y hace años que no lo hacemos, por cierto. —¿Qué? —se sorprendió Chad—¿Es decir que tú y él…? Sharpay rodó los ojos. —Sí, pero no hablaremos de mi vida sexual aquí ¿verdad? Todos los presentes hicieron cara de desagrado sobretodo Ryan que incluso se volteó para no escuchar a su hermana. —Estamos aquí para ver qué haremos con Troy y Gabriella. —¿Cómo que qué haremos? —preguntó Jason. Sharpay suspiró, se tocó el tabique dela nariz y murmuró unas palabras para sí misma. —Soy la mejor amiga de Troy Bolton, lo conozco mucho más que cualquiera de ustedes, incluso más que tú Chad… —Sí, me queda claro—interrumpió el moreno. —Y ese hombre estuvo dispuesto a pasar las fiestas solo porque no quería venir a Albuquerque a encontrarse con su amiguita Gabriella, según me contó Ryan ella tampoco quería venir ¿o me equivoco? —Taylor y Chad se miraron—no claro que no, yo nunca lo hago. En fin, a pesar de tantos años ellos, se siguen queriendo o al menos pensando el uno en el otro. —Si me imagino Troy pensaba mucho en ella cuando estaba contigo….—murmuró Taylor. —Estaba conmigo porque éramos amigos, nunca hubo nada más y dejamos de hacerlo porque era algo raro. No tendría por qué contarles esto pero están dudando de Troy y eso no lo permitiré—suspiró—yo jamás me alegría con ustedes en algo, pero Troy es mi mejor amigo y necesita saber qué siente por Gabriella, por si quiere recuperarla o simplemente despedirse. Porque me imagino saben por qué terminaron ¿no? —No hablaré de las cosas personales de Gabriella—advirtió Taylor—pero aunque me cueste admitirlo creo que tienes razón—suspiró resignada—¿qué propones? Sharpay sonrió con satisfacción, había ideado eso desde que le llegó la invitación para la reunión de ex alumnos. Ahora solo faltaba ejecutar el plan y si funcionaba, Troy Bolton le debería un año entero de pizzas. … Gabriella se abrazaba los brazos y sentía como el aire movía su cabello. La ciudad se veía tan pequeña desde arriba. No sabía bien cómo había llegado hasta la azotea de la escuela, si no quería recordar más alla de lo necesario y estaba ahí torturándose, la última vez que piso ese lugar le enseñó a bailar a Troy, parecía que hubiera sido ayer, sonrió con nostalgia y decidió era tiempo de regresar con sus compañeros, posiblemente no tendría que cruzarse con Troy, él estaría con Sharpay y ella con Taylor y así estaba bien. Sin embargo al dar la vuelta para dirigirse a la escalera de bajada la figura de un hombre algo se le cruzó por enfrente, alzó la mirada y se encontró con unos ojos azules que empezaron a envolverla en un escalofrío ya olvidado. —Hola Troy—saludo fingiendo una sonrisa—ya me iba. —No pensé estuvieras aquí. —Perdón, es tu lugar súper secreto.. —No, aquí en Albuquerque, Chad y Ryan me dijeron que no vendrías. Gabrilla asintió, —No pensaba hacerlo, Taylor me convenció y también me dijo que tú estabas montando… —Grease—completó Troy —Sí, eso. Se hizo un silencio entre ellos, el más incómodo que habían experimentado, se miraron y él la invitó a sentarse en la banca pegada a la pared. —Me dijeron que vivías en Illinoils—habló por fin Troy. Gabriella asintió. —Y tú en Nueva York, ¿cierto? —Sí. El silencio los acompañó nuevamente. —¿Y cómo has estado? —preguntó Troy. —Bien, trabajo mucho ¿y tú? ¿Cómo es la vida de artista? —Cansada y absorbente, pero los aplausos del público compensan todo—sonrió el rubio. Y estar con Sharpay me imagino que también, pensó Gabriella, pero no se atrevió a decirlo tenía miedo de la respuesta, así que solo asintió. —Me da mucho gusto, Troy—sonrió Gabriella sinceramente y se apoyó en su pierna para levantarse—De verdad, que bueno que hayas encontrado tu vocación, que te esté yendo tan bien y que todo haya valido la pena. La última frase no le causo alegría alguna y Troy la miró con ojos de arrepentimiento, pero ella volvió a asentir con la cabeza y suspiró. —Volveré a la fiesta y tranquilo, no te incomodare, estaré con Taylor. —Sí yo a ti tampoco, estré con Sharpay—aclaró Troy rápidamente pero enseguida se arrepintió. —Claro. Gabriella comenzó a caminar hacia las escaleras, ese escalofrío con el nudo en la garganta no lo sentía desde la última vez que estuvo con Troy, ese día en el aeropuerto donde se dijeron adiós. Cada vez que lo recordaba, sentía la sensación de perder el piso y se preguntaba si habían tomado la decisión correcta. —Gabriella—le gritó desde el barandal con flores—me alegra saber que estas bien. —Igualmente Troy. … A los que leyeron el primer capítulo sólo puedo decirles, ¡muchas gracias! Aquí les dejo el segundo que me divertí muchísimo escribiendo. No quería poner a Sharpay como la villana otra vez, así que aunque no es amiga de los Linces es la mejor amiga de Troy y sí, en algún momento fueron amigos con derechos, más adelante explicaran todo con detalle. Como pueden ver ya hubo un encuentro entre Troy y Gabriella y no fue el más romántico. ¿Qué pasará entre estos dos? ¿Por qué habrán terminado? No olviden dejar su review y si quieren saber más los invito a seguir mi cuenta de IG dedicada a la fabulosa, hermosa, preciosa y perfecta Vanessa Hudgens: teamhudgensmx. Ahí avisaré cuando subiré los capítulos y contestaré todas las preguntas. ¡Gracias!'][Chapter 3] ['3. S.O.S. A pesar de todo había sido una buena reunión, en efecto Troy y Gabriella no se volvieron a hablar en toda la tarde, sin embargo, varias veces fueron sorprendidos viéndose el uno al otro discretamente, aunque nunca lograron cruzar una mirada. Esa noche LavaSpring ofreció una cena con motivos navideños, Troy estuvo invitado obviamente y también Kelsey, que al parecer la había pasado muy bien con Ryan en East High y le pidió fuera su pareja en la cena familiar, sus padres la recibieron con un abrazo gustoso. —Eso es llevarse bien con un ex—le comentó Sharpay a Joe y a Troy al ver a Ryan y Kelsey reír tanto. —Hablando de ex—intervino Joe—me contó Sharp que si fue la tuya. Nuevamente Troy miró a su amiga y esta le dio un trago a su copa de vino, porqué tenía que contar sus cosas personales. —Normal—se encogió de hombros—ella está bien y eso me da gusto. —¿Y sentiste algo al verla? —La quise mucho, no podía tener sentimientos indiferentes al verla, pero nos regresamos a Nueva York pasando las fiestas, ella se regresa a Illinois la próxima semana, así que da igual lo que haya sentido. Joe miró a Sharpay y esta encogió los hombros. El sonido de una cuchara golpeando un cristal hizo que todos enfocaran su mirada al centro de la pista. El señor Evans pedía un minuto de su atención pues tenía un anuncio importante que hacer. —Muchas gracias a esta todos hoy por estar aquí—comenzó su discurso—es una época muy importante para nosotros porque nuestros hijos vuelven a casa—los señaló— aunque a ustedes esto no les agrade ya que sin ellos sí había probabilidades de que uno de ustedes ganara el premio Súper estrella. Las risas incomodas y fingidas resonaron por todo el campo. —Estoy contento de presentarles a novio de mi hija Joe McCartey que tiene unas palabras que dedicar esta noche. Joe se arregló la corbata y se levantó de su lugar, Sharpay lo miró con curiosidad, ¿desde cuándo hacia planes sin consultarle y más con su padre? Miró a Troy y este hizo la misma cara de sorpresa que ella. —Muchas gracias, señor Evans—habló después de darle un abrazo a su suegro—pues como saben soy novio de Sharpay desde hace 3 años, los 3 años más bonitos de mi vida pero también los más difíciles porque aguantar a la señorita Evans no es sencillo—de nuevo todos rieron y empezaron a murmurar—pero, Sharpay—caminó hacia ella—eres la mujer más maravillosa del mundo, eres inteligente, divertida, buena amiga, eres ambiciosa y nunca dudas en ir por lo que quieres, tú me hiciste ver el mundo de otra forma y quiero que sigas haciéndolo todos los días de mi vida. Joe se hincó y sacó una cajita de su saco, Sharpay se llevó las manos a la boca levantándose de su asiento y tirando la silla. —Señorita Evans, ¿quieres casarte conmigo? Sharpay camino hacia donde su novio estaba, sus ojos se llenaron de lágrimas y sin poder articular palabra afirmó con la cabeza mientras Joe le colocaba el diamante en el dedo. Los meseros aparecieron con copas y comenzaron a servir champagne entre los invitados. Kelsey aplaudía emocionada hasta que se percató que Troy no estaba contento en absoluto. —¿Entonces sí estás enamorado de ella? —le preguntó Kelsey sin dejar de aplaudir. —¿Qué? ¿De qué estás hablando? —No pareces muy feliz de que se haya comprometido. Troy suspiró —No es por Sharpay, estoy muy contento por ella y Joe, son mis mejores amigos. —Pero... —Chad y Taylor viven juntos, Sharpay se casa y yo llego a mi departamento a ver las noticias todas las noches. —Pero eso no tiene nada de malo Troy, digo yo tampoco tengo pareja y no siento que es el fin del mundo. —No lo entiendes—respiró profundo—yo ya me iba a casar Kelsey, hace seis años le di un anillo a Gabriella y hoy ni siquiera nos miramos. Kelsey no tuvo palabras para responder a eso, recordaba claramente el día que Gabriella subió a su Facebook una foto en Disneylandia con un comentario diciendo \"Sí y mil veces sí\". Por eso a todo mundo le sorprendió cuando ambos dejaron de subir fotos juntos y Troy empezaba a subir en Nueva York y Gabriella en cualquier parte del mundo. —¡Troy! —llegó corriendo Sharpay, ya había cambiado las lágrimas por una sonrisa contagiosa—tenemos que salir a celebrar esto—señaló su anillo— nos vemos mañana a las 8 pm en Monroe\\'s. —Sharpay, enserio quiero dejar de salir con ustedes, es incómodo para mí ¿sabes? —Eh, sin reproches. Troy miró a Kelsey y esta encogió los hombros. Posterior a eso se dedicaron a disfrutar de la velada en el prestigioso club. … Habían estado todo el día en casa jugando voleibol junto a la alberca, cocinado carne asada y bebiendo cerveza. —Chad, deberíamos salir—comento Taylor después de ver su celular—¿recuerdas lo mucho que nos gustaba Monroe\\'s? —Oh sí, deberíamos ir esta noche. Gabriella los miro extrañada, las conversaciones entre sus amigos solían menor fingidas. —¿Qué dices Gab? ¿Vas con nosotros? —pregunto Taylor. —Oh no, no iré de mal tercio. —No lo harás, Kelsey ira también verdad, ¿verdad Kel? —Sí y Marta igual, vayamos todos. —respondió Kelsey emocionada. La cara de Gabriella mostró duda, pero las miradas de todos hicieron que se convenciera, ¿qué podría salir mal? Total, lo peor ya había pasado, había visto a Troy y aunque tuvo un nodo en la garganta, un hueco en el estómago y mucho temblor en las piernas al verlo. Era increíble como después de 5 años seguía teniendo esas sanciones. Pero después de su charla entendió que lo mejor que habían hecho había sido separarse y dejar que ambos siguieran sus sueños. Cerró su libro y fue a su habitación para arreglarse. —Siento Gabriella me va quitar la palabra por toda la vida—se lamentó Taylor poniendo sus manos sobre la cara y sentándose en la mesa. —No lo creo, ellos tienen que hablar—comentó Kelsey—yo vi a Troy ayer en la pedida de mano de Sharpay, la extraña. —¿Qué? —se extrañó Chad —Que la extraña. —No lo de Sharpay, ¿se va a casar? —Kelsey asintió—¿O sea que de verdad no tiene nada con Troy? —No, Chad—contestó Kelsey—¿pero por qué te interesa tanto? —Porque Gabriella cree que tienen algo—respondió Taylor—cree que Troy tiene una vida con Sharpay, que es muy feliz. —Pues no, no es así, Troy es muy amigo de Sharpay, sé que lo encontró deprimido en Nueva York y que se hicieron amigos, pero también es cercano a Joe, el prometido de Sharpay. Así que estoy segura que sus intenciones son sinceras, por eso quedaron de verse en Monroe\\'s, ella no irá y confía nosotros también mandemos sola a Gabriella. —Estoy lista—sonrió la última mencionada—¿nos vamos? —Sí, voy pidiendo el uber. … Miraba el reloj desesperadamente, ¿por qué Sharpay solía llegar tarde a todos lados? Le había marcado 3 veces, le había enviado mensajes pero su rubia amiga no daba señales de vida. Llevaba ya tres copas de whiskey y aunque el grupo que tocaba era bueno, se estaba aburriendo. Miró hacia la entrada y no creyó lo que estaba pasando. ¿Coincidencia? Lo dudaba, Sharpay pagaría por ello. Gabriella estaba ahí, hablando para que les dieran a mesa, a ella a Taylor, Chad, Marta y Taylor. Asustado, se levantó rápidamente y pretendió ir al baño, pero la voz de su amigo mencionando su nombre lo detuvo. —Troy, ¡Que sorpresa! —exclamó Chad. Rápidamente miró a Gabriella que tenía la misma cara que se imaginaba el estaba poniendo, molesta y decepcionada. —¿Nos podemos sentar contigo? —Preguntó Chad jalando la silla de la mesa donde Troy tomaba rápidamente otra copa. —Chad, no creo sea buena idea—habló Taylor fingiendo no sabía nada. Pero Gabriella negó con la cabeza e imitó el movimiento de Chad. —¿Qué sigue? —preguntó Gabriella a sus amigos—¿Cuál es el siguiente paso de su plan para que Troy y yo hablamos? Las chicas y Chad se voltearon a ver con cierta pena en su rostro. —¿Sharpay es parte de este plan? —quiso saber Troy y todos asintieron. El ex capitán del equipo, levantó la mano para pedirle la cuenta al mesero. —Que tengan buena noche—expresó con desagrado una vez firmando el recibo de su tarjeta de crédito. Los amigos de Gabriella la miraron pero está con cara de decepción se levantó de la mesa y todos agacharon la mirada con arrepentimiento. … Gabriella salió mirando el celular, buscaba un uber pero todos se encontraban lejos así que prefirió tomar un taxi de la calle, pues el frio que hacia ni su abrigo ni sus botas sobre las mallas se lo quitaban. Por no tener la mirada al frente no se dio cuenta cuando chocó con alguien. —Disculpa. —Oh no hay problema. Ambos se paralizaron al darse cuenta de quien se trataba, Gabriella rodó los ojos y se encaminó a la orilla de la acera para hacerla la parada a un taxi. —Gabriella—la alcanzó Troy y la tomó del brazo—disculpa por lo de ahí adentro, creo que Sharpay fue muy lejos esta vez. —¿Cómo Sharpay? —se sorprendió Gabriella—¿Qué ustedes no están juntos? —¿Qué? ¿Sharpay y yo? —se extrañó Troy—no, nada que ver. Es decir, es mi amiga, pero nada más, de hecho, ayer le pidieron matrimonio y me dijo que nos veíamos aquí para celebrar. Un alivió se sintió en el pecho de Gabriella, trato de disimularlo, pero una sonrisa se formó en su rostro. —No tenía idea, de igual forma culpo a Chad y a Taylor. Ellos sabían que nosotros no nos queríamos ver más. —Claro, porque eso acordamos. Gabriella asintió y le dio un beso en la mejilla a Troy en señal de despedida pues un taxi por fin había atendido a su señal, pero mientras abría la puerta Troy habló, aunque no supo si era él o el efecto de los whiskeys ingeridos previamente. —Oye, dado que nos quedamos sin plan para esta noche—Gabriella lo miró—¿No quisieras ir a cenar? Digo por los viejos tiempos. La morena dudo unos segundos, pero asintió y cerró la puerta del taxi pidiéndole perdón al conductor. Troy suspiró aliviado y se emparejó a ella. Ambos comenzaron a caminar por la avenida principal de Albuquerque, con un frío que traspasaba todas sus ropas y con nervios que no podían disimular. Sin duda esa noche sería muy larga para ambos. … El teléfono de Taylor comenzó a sonar, sin embargo, al ver de quien se trataba Chad decidió tomar la llamada. —Tu plan apesta—se quejó el moreno. —¿O eso crees? —Claro, Troy no te volverá a hablar en su vida y suponemos Gabriella a nosotros tampoco. No sé en qué momento nos pareció buena idea hacerte caso. —En primer lugar, deja de gritar, Danford. No seas ordinario por favor. En segundo lugar, si mi plan apesta, ¿Por qué Gabriella acaba de dejar ir un taxi para emprender una caminata con Troy? —¿De qué hablas? Sharpay suspiró desesperada. —Era obvio que no les confiaría este plan a ustedes, estoy en la cafetería de enfrente y nuestros amiguitos al parecen tienen un plan juntos esta noche y ¿gracias a quién? Ah sí, a Sharpay Evans. En fin, sólo quería decirles que el plan funciona, pero si quieren dejar de ser parte y que Gabriella vuelva a Illinois sin saber qué pasará con Troy entonces puedo seguir yo sola. Chad miró a Taylor que estaba pegada a la bocina, esta le hizo una señal indicándole que sí querían continuar con el plan. —Seguimos dentro—respondió resignado—¿Qué sigue ahora? —Eso depende de cómo les vaya la noche a estos dos, pero si no me equivoco terminarán fingiendo ser amigos así que vayan preparando una fiesta en su casa rentada para pedirle perdón a Gabriella. Y dicho esto, colgó. Las chicas y Chad se miraron y encogieron los hombros. —Espero esto funcione, si no me arrepentiré toda la vida de estarle haciendo caso a Sharpay. No hubo más comentarios al respecto, así que se dedicaron a cenar, total ya estaban ahí. … ¡Hola! Muchas gracias por gente que sigue leyendo esto. No fue un capitulo largo porque el que sigue veremos muchas cosas: la cena entre Troy y Gabriella, el por qué terminaron y qué pasará después de esto. ¿Será que Sharpay tiene razón?

Closer (La canción de este capítulo es Closer de The Chainsmokers , recomiendo la escuchen para que se puedan imaginar mejor la escena) Un bar en medio de la ciudad había sido el destino que Troy y Gabriella habían elegido para poder hablar. Era un lugar acogedor, con luces tenues y música tranquila de un grupo en vivo. En el camino no hablaron mucho, se quejaron del clima y lo compararon con el de Nueva York y el de Illinoils respectivamente, preguntaron por sus padres, por sus propósitos para el año siguiente, dijeron algunas bromas y, de repente, recordaron una noche similar en diciembre, con frio, nieve y ellos dos riendo, siendo dos extraños como ahora se esforzaban en parecer. Siguieron caminando en silencio, preguntándose si estaban convencidos con esa cena, pero ya estaban ahí no les caería mal, total ¿Qué era lo peor que pudiese pasar si ya no estaban juntos? Los llevaron a su mesa, el clima no era comparable con el del exterior por lo que Gabriella vio innecesario seguir con el abrigo puesto y lo dejó en el perchero junto a su bolsa. Usaba una blusa con escote de color azul. Troy la miró y sonrió. —Te ves hermosa—confesó Troy. Gabriella le devolvió la sonrisa. —Tú igual te ves muy bien, los musicales te mantienen en forma. Ambos soltaron una risa cuando el mesero llegó a tomarles la orden. —¿Quieres compartir pizza? —preguntó Troy y ella asintió. —Margarita—respondieron los dos al mismo tiempo y el mesero sonrió mientras ellos se miraron. —Y dos cervezas—agregó Gabriella—¿O ya tomas otra cosa? —No, cerveza está bien. El mesero les retiró las cartas y se fue, dejando un silencio incomodo con música de fondo. —Bueno—rompió Troy el silencio—parece que aún nos conocemos. Gabriella torció la boca. —Estuvimos 6 años juntos, Troy. Sería muy triste que no lo supiéramos. —Sí tienes razón. —Aunque, parece que no te conozco tanto—confesó Gabriella, pareciendo que tenía muchas ganas de decirlo. —¿A qué te refieres? , Gracias—preguntó Troy y agradeció al mesero que acababa de llevar las cervezas. —Nunca creí pudieras ser tan cercano a Sharpay—respondió después de darle un trago a su cerveza sin poder disimular sus celos. —Sí, fue algo raro—contó Troy después de una risita—es mi amiga, Gabriella te lo juro. Un año después de que terminamos quise seguir con mi vida, me fui a Nueva York como te propuse y estuve en varias fiestas, en una de ellas encontré a Sharpay—Gabriella asintió—a partir de ahí, no perdimos contacto…. —¿Tuvieron algo qué ver? —interrumpió Gabriella la anécdota. Ni siquiera sabía por qué estaba preguntando eso, en realidad no debería de importarle, pero quiso saber, tenía mucha curiosidad por saber si era verdad que entre Troy y Sharpay sólo había habido amistad. Pensándolo más profundo, no tendría derecho a reprocharla nada, ya no eran nada y ella también estuvo con personas en esos cinco años y si ahora estaban cenando era porque se habían quedado sin plan para esa noche, no porque quisieran arreglarlo. La cara de Troy respondió antes que su boca, Gabriella tuvo que respirar para no generar una expresión de celos. —Ya no estábamos juntos—se excusó Troy—y no funcionó entre ella y yo. Yo nunca deje de pensar en ti. Gabriella pidió con una seña que no hablará más, no quería escuchar como pensaba en ella mientras estaba con Sharpay. —Gabriella, por favor—pidió Troy—¿Tú no has estado con nadie desde esa fecha? La muchacha bajó la mirada y le dio otro trago a su cerveza. —Quedamos se seguir con nuestras vidas ¿no? —recordó Troy. —Sí tienes razón—suspiró la pelinegra—perdona, es que todo esto es muy raro, volver a vernos volver a hablar, asumir que todo estaba bien y la verdad es que no lo está. La conversación se vio interrumpida por el mesero que les dejaba la pizza en el centro de la mesa acompañada de dos platos para que ambos se sirvieran. —¿Qué nos pasó, Troy? —Preguntó Gabriella, totalmente dispuesta a sincerarse, no sabía cuántas cosas tenía que decirle a su ex novio hasta que lo tuvo de frente—¿Por qué no pudimos con todo? Siempre creí superaríamos al adversidades, lo habíamos hecho. Superamos la universidad pero no pudimos con… —El futuro—concluyó Troy. Gabriella asintió y le dio un trago a la nueva cerveza que le habían llevado. …5 años atrás… La Universidad de Berkeley preparaba una fiesta, los alumnos de Teatro se encontraban reunidos discutiendo sobre los castings que se harían en Nueva York el verano siguiente. Troy, tomaba una cerveza sintiéndose un poco culpable porque ese fin de semana iría a ver a Gabriella pero esa fiesta era importante para él, pues conocería gente que lo podía ayudar a tener su primera aparición en una obra teatral fuera de la escuela. Al parecer su novia lo había entendido, en realidad no lo sabía muy bien pues tenía tiempo que no hablaban por más de media hora. Gabriella había empezado como becaria en un importante buffet de abogados y apenas tenía tiempo para respirar entre sus clases y prácticas. Hacia un mes que no se veían y cuando él le aviso por whats app que no podría ir, ella sólo le respondió con un \"ok : )\" así que asumía todo bien. Aunque estaba inquieto, Gabriella parecía distante y cuando en una de esas llamadas fugaces le comentó la idea de irse a Nueva York ella no le dio una respuesta. Le urgía verla, platicar con ella, definir qué pasaría con ellos, pero ninguno de los dos parecía encontrar un tiempo para verse. Pero este tiempo se dio en la graduación de Gabriella, dos meses después de aquella fiesta, pues forzosamente Troy tuvo que ir a verla con un ramo de flores en la mano y un discurso que no le emocionaba del todo de decir. La amaba, la había amado desde el primer momento en que se vieron, pero sentía que lo suyo no iba para ningún lado, tenían 4 meses sin verse y su comunicación tampoco ayudaba, él se quería ir a Nueva York pero ella seguía evitando el tema. Al llegar con Gabriella fue recibido con un abrazo y un beso demasiado profundo el cual duró un poco más de tres minutos, al sentir sus labios con los de ella y sus cuerpos en cercanía pensó que había exagerado y que todo entre ellos iba a estar bien pero una vez que se separaron y se miraron a los ojos, entendió que no era el único que estaba sintiendo esa cuerda quebrarse. Esperaron que pasara la ceremonia y una vez en el auto de Troy tuvieron que sincerarse. —Troy—comenzó Gabriella con voz resignada—te amo, eres lo mejor que me ha pasado en la vida… —Pero no podemos seguir—concluyó Troy sin mirarla. Ella lo miró y por una parte se alegró de que él estuviera sintiendo lo mismo que ella, pero por otra veía como todo un mundo que habían construido se derrumbaba lentamente. —No puedo ir contigo a Nueva York—se le quebró la voz—ni puedo pedirte que te quedes conmigo. Troy le tomó la mano y le besó los nudillos mientras ella comenzaba a llorar. —Me están ofreciendo un trabajo en Illinoils, es una empresa reconocida y quiero estar ahí mientras logro poner mi propio despacho. —Están empezando los castings para algunas obras en Nueva York y me dijo un maestro es mi oportunidad. —Estoy segura que te quedarás en el primero—le sonrió—eres el mejor Troy y me alegra haber estado en esta etapa de tu vida. Se recargó en su hombro y subió la radio, eran los últimos 20 minutos que estaría a su lado, ya no tenían nada más de que hablar, estaban seguros de lo que estaban haciendo pues llevaban meses dándole vueltas. Gabriella se bajó del coche, no sin antes darle un último beso y acariciarle la cara, él la tomó de la cintura y sintió su aroma por última vez, sabiendo que nunca más volverían a estar juntos, que no se rozarían sus pies debajo de la sabana después de hacer el amor, que no tendrían más brindis en año nuevo ni volverían a cantar juntos en un karaoke, pero se amaban tanto que estaban dejando los dos siguieran con su vida. Prometieron no hablarse ni buscarse y dejarle las cosas al destino, sin esperar algún día se encontrarían pues sería mucho más difícil para ambos. Así que con un apretón de manos terminaron la historia de amor que habían empezado un 31 de diciembre invadidos de copos de nieve. Pero no todo terminó ahí pues durante los siguientes dos meses siguieron preguntándose cómo estaban si tenían planes de vacaciones y a veces diciéndose lo mucho que se extrañaban, pero eso sólo los lastimaba más así que decidieron cambiar de números y empezar a salir con más gente. …Actualidad… —Realmente me costó mucho superarte—confesó Gabriella—salí con chicos, pero ninguno serio, me asustaba mucho el compromiso. Así que me dediqué a trabajar, comprar una cosa y pedirle a mi mamá que se fuera a vivir conmigo, estaba muy sola. Habían comido toda la pizza y cada uno llevaba ya 5 cervezas, recordar qué les había pasado los había puesto muy sentimentales. —Para mí tampoco fue fácil—coincidió Troy—y tampoco hubo nada serio, ni con Sharpay ella también estaba pasando por algo similar pero después de que descubrimos estábamos haciendo una estupidez juntos nos hicimos mejores amigos, entonces ella empezó a salir con Joe y ahora se van a casar. —¿Eso quiere decir que somos los solteros más codiciados de los Estados Unidos? —bromeó la muchacha. —Eso parece. —Salud por eso—chocaron sus cervezas. Una canción conocida para ambos empezó a sonar en el bar. Troy hizo la seña de que la escuchara y ella solo se rio. Pero ocultó su cara cuando su acompañante se levantó de la mesa y comenzó a cantar. — Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you I drink too much and that\\'s an issue but I\\'m okay Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again La gente que se encontraba en el bar comenzó a aplaudir y a gritar en señal de apoyo al cantante. Algunas muchachas comenzaron a grabar al darse cuenta que era el famoso Troy Bolton el que ahora cantaba en ese lugar. — I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car And four years, no calls Now you\\'re looking pretty in a hotel bar And I can\\'t stop No, I can\\'t stop Troy llego al centro de la pista y tomó el micrófono que hacía unos momentos ocupaba el cantante principal de la banda en vivo. Miró a Gabriella y comenzó a hacerle señas para que se para a cantar con él pero esta seguía con la cara dentro de sus manos. — So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover That I know you can\\'t afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder We ain\\'t ever getting older We ain\\'t ever getting older We ain\\'t ever getting older En la tonada de la canción la gente seguía aplaudiendo y el mesero se quedó junto a Gabriella después de darle su cambio pues ya pensaban partir del lugar. —¿Tu no cantas? —le preguntó a la chica. Gabriella lo pensó mucho, estaba un poco mareada pero estar ahí con Troy le traía recuerdos que quería volver a vivir así que cuando el turno de la voz de chica comenzó también se levantó de su asiento a cantar. — You look as good as the day I met you I forget just why I left you, I was insane Stay and play that Blink-182 song That we beat to death in Tucson, okay Caminó hasta llegar a lado de Troy el cual le dio le dio una vuelta. — I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car And four years, no call Now I\\'m looking pretty in a hotel bar And I can\\'t stop No, I can\\'t stop Ambos se miraron de frente y cantaron a una sola voz el coro de la canción, no era el famoso actor de musicales ni la abogada preferida de la compañía, eran Troy y Gabriella recordando cómo se enamoraron. — So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover That I know you can\\'t afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder We ain\\'t ever getting older We ain\\'t ever getting older We ain\\'t ever getting older La gente aplaudió con emoción cuando ambos terminaron, pero ellos solo podían sentir la atmosfera que los envolvía, con sus respiraciones agitadas, sus manos entrelazadas y sus miradas en la misma dirección. Sonrieron como reacción a sus emociones, pero todo se desvaneció cuando una fila de muchachas jóvenes se paró enfrente de Troy. —Amé tu papel en Grease—aplaudió una—¿Me puedo tomar una foto contigo? Troy miró a Gabriella, pero esta asintió y volvió a su mesa. Era imposible que Troy pasara desapercibido, ella misma lo había visto en periódicos, revistas y anuncios en los especulares de la calle. Se culpó a si misma por haber sentido que todo era como antes, ya nada podía ser así. Se aburrió de ver como Troy sonreía con todas al tomarse las fotos, así que tomó su abrigo y se dirigió hasta la puerta, agradeciendo a las personas que la felicitaban por el acto musical. Miró su reloj, era un poco tarde pero esperaba poder conseguir un taxi y volver a la casa que tenía con Taylor, ya no estaba enojada con ellos. Al final de cuentas esa noche con Troy le había hecho darse cuenta de lo mucho que lo extrañaba pero también, al ver cómo había terminado esa noche, de que lo mejor era ya no estar juntos. —¡Gabriella! —la alcanzó Troy corriendo— ¿Por qué te vas así? Si es por lo de esas chicas… —No es por lo de esas chicas—suspiró—Troy, esta es tu vida. Tú das autógrafos yo llevo las legislaciones de una empresa. Siempre hemos ido por distintos caminos y es muy injusto querer cambiarlos. Gabriella le dio un beso en la mejilla cuando su taxi se detuvo. —Siempre serás importante para mí—le susurró —pero esto es mejor así. Troy vio a Gabriella subirse al taxi y alejarse. —Y tú sigues siendo el amor de mi vida—se dijo así mismo. Estaba decidido, no la volvería a perder, si Sharpay y Chad habían iniciado ese reencuentro ahora tendrían que ayudarlo a llegar hasta el final. … ¡Hola! Perdón por la demora, me fui de vacaciones a la playita y me fue imposible seguir. Pero aquí está el capítulo. Espero les haya gustado porque yo LO AME, lloré, me reí y canté, esta es mi canción favorita y siempre había querido usarla en algo, de hecho si algún día escribo una novela original será basada en esa canción así que espero les haya gustado cómo la adapté. No podía ser un fanfic de HSM sin canción ni show musical, ¿verdad? Yo creo habrá otro en los siguientes capítulos así que no se lo pierdan. Por fin sabemos por qué terminaron y qué Troy no la dejará ir de nuevo, ¿Gabriella querrá lo mismo? Ya lo veremos en los siguientes capítulos. Quiero dedicar este capítulo a mi amiga Erika por darme ideas, sin ella me hubiera tardado un poco más en subirlo. ¡GRACIAS INFINITAS A TODOS LOS QUE ME LEEN! Los invito a dejarme su comentario en el cuadrito de aquí abajo o en algún mensaje o comentario en la cuenta de Instagram TeamHudgensMX, de verdad sus aportaciones son muy valiosas para mí. Los quiero mucho, mucho. ~Luriana~'][Chapter 5] ['5. Body say (Este capítulo tiene contenido explicito) Un poco mareada logró entrar a la casa que estaban habitando por esa semana, cruzó el jardín y le sorprendió ver una luz prendida en la sala de estar, al entrarse encontró con una Taylor preocupada que al verla se lanzó a ella con un abrazo. —Perdóname—pidió la morena a Gabriella—Sé que tú no querías hablar con Troy y nosotros te forzamos. Sharpay dijo que él te extrañaba mucho y creímos que al menos se merecían una oportunidad de hablar. La recién llegada suspiró y se sirvió una taza de café que tenían en la barra de la cocina. —No te preocupes Taylor, lo hicieron con la mejor intención—su amiga la miró—también lo extrañaba, pero verlo hoy me hizo darme cuenta que terminar fue lo mejor que pudimos hacer. Gabriella le contó todo lo que había pasado esa noche, desde la pizza favorita de ambos hasta show musical final, sin obviar que recordaron su ruptura y que terminando de cantar una larga fila de jóvenes le pidieron una foto a Troy. —¿Te das cuenta, Tay? Esa es la vida de Troy. Por algún momento de esta noche volvimos a ser aquellos jóvenes que se escondían en el campo de golf de su trabajo de verano para besarse—cerró sus ojos—pero cinco minutos después ya era el famoso Troy Bolton que aparece en revistas y espectaculares. Taylor se sentó a su lado imitando su acción de servirse una taza de café. —Gabriella—le tomó su mano—tú hiciste a ese Troy y que sea famoso no quiere decir que no te quiera, esas chicas… —Esas chicas sueñan con él, otras como Sharpay lo besarán en escena. ¿Tú te sentirías cómoda si medio país tuviera una foto de Chad en su habitación? Y eso ahorita que sólo está haciendo musicales, no dudo que pronto comience con el cine. —Pues Chad también ha sido portada de periódicos, revistas, incluso tiene una figura suya que salió la temporada pasada en una caja de cereal—Gabriella le lanzó una mirada desaprobatoria—y no sólo mujeres, también hombres y niños me imagino sueñan con él. Sé lo que se siente ir de vacaciones y tener que detenernos para que se tomara una foto con algún fan. Yo sé lo que es eso y por eso mismo te digo, amiga, que no es importante. Okay, Troy se besará con alguien en escena pero ¿tú no sabías eso cuando le dijiste que se dedicará al teatro? ¿Qué creías que tú ibas a ser su pareja en todas las obras? Tú ni siquiera te planteaste la idea de estudiar eso. —Taylor…. —Mira Gabriella—no la dejó hablar—si tú me dices que no sentiste nada al verlo, que está todo superado y que volverás Illinoils segura de que Troy quedó en el pasado, te juro que no te vuelvo a tocar el tema. Pero si al estar con él, sentiste que había una oportunidad, sentiste esa paz que envolvió a ambos por seis años, entonces no dejes que esto acabe así. Tú eres mucho más inteligente que esto—le dio un beso en la mejilla—ahora ve a dormir que se ve las cervezas te marearon un poquito. —Y por cierto—agregó Taylor—mañana haremos una fiesta de despedida. Troy está invitado. Gabriella rodó los ojos y sin decir una palabra más se fue a su habitación. Se quitó los zapatos y aventó el abrigo. Había sido un día de muchas emociones. Nunca pensó que ese viaje a Albuquerque reviviría tantos recuerdos dormidos. Mientras se desmaquillaba pensó en Troy, los copos de nieve que se veían a través de la ventana la hicieron recordar cómo se conocieron y sonrió al entender que el destino los unió pues no era coincidencia que de conocerse en un hotel pasaran a estar en la misma escuela. Pero eso se había acabado, lo de esa noche no había sido obra del universo si no de sus amigos que insistían en algo que ya no tenía sentido. Sí, Taylor podía tener razón que Troy fuera famoso no impedía que sintiera cosas por ella pero no estaba segura si podía vivir en ese mundo. Era mejor que las cosas siguieran su curso, que ella regresará a Illinoils y que renunciara a su trabajo, pues a esa noche había recordado que su meta era poner un despacho de abogados y creía ya tenía la experiencia suficiente para hacerlo. Así que esa noche durmió tranquila, olvidando completamente lo que había dicho Taylor sobre la fiesta al otro día y sin saber lo que le esperaba. …. —¿Estás segura que no quieres venir? —preguntó Troy a Sharpay que veía una película desde el regazo de su novio. —No tengo a que ir, nunca fui amiga de tus amigos—respondió sin mirarlo—espera a Ryan y se van juntos. Además si vas a recuperar a Gabriella, es mejor que no vaya yo, seguimos sin ser amigas y dudo algún día lo seamos, incluso si vuelven eh. No esperes salgamos los cuatro de fiesta. —Y eso si vuelven—agregó Joe—porque por lo que contaste, anoche ella dejó muy claro que ya no quiere estar contigo. Sharpay lo miró y asintió con la cabeza. —Joe tiene razón—coincidió la rubia—cenaron su pizza favorita, bebieron cerveza, cantaron a duo y se fue dándote un beso en el cachete. No es como la mejor despedida ¿no crees? —No sé porque sigo siendo su amigo. —Porque no tienes otros—agregó Joe y tanto él como Sharpay se rieron. —Estoy listo, ¿nos vamos Troy? —dijo Ryan. —Sí, demasiada toxicidad en esta sala. Ryan y Troy se encaminaron a la puerta y escucharon a Sharpay gritar. —No olviden los preservativos. Subieron a uno de los coches de la familia Evans y se encaminaron hacia la casa donde el resto de los Linces se encontraban, realmente no estaba lejos pero a Troy se le hizo una eternidad. Estaba asustado, no sabía qué le iba a decir a Gabriella porque ya no quería forzarla a una relación. La amaba nunca había dejado de hacerlo, estaba dispuesto a olvidarla pero después de la cena de anoche, cuando se dio cuenta ella lo miraba con los mismos ojos que hacía 5 años, quiso internarlo nuevamente. Sabía que no sería fácil pues sus trabajos los limitarían, sabía también que era culpable de no haber intentado lo suficiente años atrás dejando que todo se desvaneciera, pero nunca era tarde para luchar por la persona que había logrado su vida tuviera sentido. Y no porque fuera dependiente de Gabriella, sino porque fue ella quien le abrió los ojos quien le enseñó a alcanzar sus sueños y a enfrentar las adversidades. Si ese 31 de diciembre no hubiera sido el comienzo de algo nuevo, él posiblemente jugaría junto Chad en el equipo de Nueva Jersey cuando nunca estuvo realmente seguro si eso era lo que quería. Llegaron su destino después de 20 minutos, Chad los esperaba con una cerveza en la mano y Zeke los abrazó para invitarlos a pasar. Kelsey y Ryan se abrazaron y besaron en las mejillas. Marta platicaba con Jason en un sillón alejado y Gabriella y Taylor comían papas en la barra de la cocina, pero al ver entrar a los chicos fueron a saludarlos. Pasaron la tarde recordando anécdotas de la escuela y de los acontecimientos más recientes en las vidas de ambos. Los tragos no se hicieron esperar pues tenían cervezas, ron y whiskey, botellas que fueron quedando vacías en el transcurso de la tarde, jugaron jenga con shots como castigo a quien lo tirara. Al final Zeke y Jason se fueron temprano pues su vuelo salía esa noche, así que todos se quedaron siguieron tomando el licor que quedaba. —¿Y piensan casarse en algún momento? —preguntó Troy a Chad que abrazaba a Taylor. La pareja se volteó a ver y soltó una carcajada. —Ya se habían tardado en preguntar eso—respondió Chad. —Mi madre no deja de preguntarme eso—intervino Taylor—pero no por el momento, estamos muy bien así, ¿verdad amor? —No podríamos estar mejor—dijo el moreno sujetando la barbilla de su novia y besándola. Troy miró hacia donde Gabriella estaba y se encontró con su mirada clavada en él. No habían tenido tiempo de platicar, habían estado en grupo todo el tiempo y él no había querido hablar a solas con ella para que no se sintiera presionada, posiblemente ese día no era le indicado para hablar. O eso creía hasta que vio que se levantó a la cocina con su vaso en la mano. Chad y Taylor se seguían besando, Ryan, Kelsey y Marta contaban chistes, así que siguió a Gabriella hasta la cocina. —¿Llegaste bien anoche? —Preguntó Troy al estar junto a Gabriella que se estaba sirviendo hielos, ella asintió solamente y sonrió—espero no te haya incomodado que viniera. —No, para nada, ¿hielo? —Troy asintió—Me alegra que nos podamos reunir todos por última vez antes de volver a nuestras vidas. Nunca fue una Lince como tal, pero East High fue la mejor época de mi vida. Ambos se recargaron en la barra de la cocina mientras daban tragos pequeños a sus bebidas. —Pero, si es por ti que todo esto es posible—aclaró Troy—ve a esos dos, ni siquiera se hablaban. Miraron a Chad y Taylor que seguían besándose. —Cambiaste a East High—continuó el chico y la miró fijamente—me cambiaste a mí. Troy le colocó el mechón de cabello detrás de la oreja y se acercó lentamente a su rostro. Gabriella quiso dejar su vaso en la barra pero no lo logró puesto que en el intento se calló al piso. —Que idiota—expresó Gabriella y se agachó para recoger los pedazos. Su acompañante cerró los ojos sintiéndose culpable por querer besarla, así que hincó con ella para ayudarla. Al estar los dos a la altura Gabriella lo miró a los ojos y no tardó un segundo en jalarlo del cuello de la camisa y colocar sus labios sobre los dos de él. Troy abrazó la cintura de su compañera mientras ella entrelazaba fuertemente su dedos entre su cabello. Cinco años sin tener sus cuerpos tan cerca, sin inhalar el aroma del otro, sin rozar su piel. El besó no se detuvo, al contrario, subió su intensidad, haciendo que al levantarse ambos perdieran el equilibrio y tuvieran que recargarse en la barra fría mientras se resbalaban por el piso mojado. Gabriella jaló hacia su cuerpo a Troy y esté comenzó a meter las manos en su blusa. La muchacha se separó y se vio hacia la sala, por suerte todos estaban distraídos y las escaleras que dirigían hacia la habitación estaban sólo a unos pasos. Se quitó los tacones y le hizo una señal a Troy para que subiera con ella. Una vez arriba, siguieron besándose perdiendo el equilibrio, Gabriella encontró su manija sin ver y entraron a tropezones a la habitación, aventó sus zapatos y quitó la chamarra de Troy, ya empezaba a sentir la dureza entre las piernas de este, le quito su playera mientras él comenzaba a bajar sus labios por su cuello hasta llegar a su hombros. —¿No te arrepentirás de esto? —murmuró sin despegar los labios de su piel. —Tal vez—respondió obligándolo a besarle los labios nuevamente—pero me arrepentiré más si nos detenemos ahorita. Troy despojó a Gabriella de su blusa y sintió su piel desnuda, había soñado con ese encuentro desde la última vez que estuvo con ella. Le encantaban sus pechos pequeños, así que no dudo en besarlos cuando quedó sin sostén. Gabriella tenía los ojos cerrados mientras él recorría con sus labios su cuerpo ya desnudo. Después fue el turno de ella, no hubo lugar en el cuerpo atlético de Troy que no hubiera dejado sin cubrir por un beso y pequeños mordiscos. Entre gemidos y sudor volvieron a estar juntos, a entrelazar sus dedos mientras sus cuerpos se volvían uno y se movían con la armonía que sólo ellos habían creado. No era como aquella primera vez en la que ambos eran torpes y temerosos. Ni era como lo habían hecho cuando habían estado con otras personas. Parecía increíble que Gabriella volviera a aferrarse a la espalda de Troy mientras este escondía su rostro en el cuello de su compañera. Él sintió como los muslos de Gabriella se endurecían y su espalda se arqueaba mientras con un beso callaba esa expresión de placer que estaba emitiendo. Ambos relajaron sus cuerpos y aún con el corazón latiéndoles a mil por hora, tranquilizaron su respiración y se besaron nuevamente. Troy acercó a él el cuerpo desnudo de Gabriella y admiró sus ojos. —Gabriella, yo… —Shh—colocó su dedo en los labios de Troy para volver a besarlos—no digas nada por ahora, dejemos que esto se quede aquí y mañana hablamos de lo que quieras. Troy asintió y abrió su brazo para que ella pudiera acomodarse en su pecho, el cual besó. —Quedate a dormir. Gabriella no entendió bien lo que había hecho, pero fue algo que no pudo detener, sintió la necesidad de estar con Troy y no encontró objeción alguna para hacerlo. Sólo había un pequeño problema a esas alturas. Ya no estaba muy segura de que haberse dejado había sido la mejor opción. … —No sé si volver a casa sin Troy o esperarlo—dijo Ryan mientras todos recogían la basura que la reunión había ocasionado. —Vuelve sin él—aconsejó Chad dándole una palmada en el hombro—dudo salga de la habitación de Gabriella. —O puedes quedarte también tu si quieres—habló una Kelsey sonrojada. —Okay, nosotros nos vamos a dormir—concluyó Taylor. Ryan y Kelsey se miraron e intercambiaron una sonrisa. Sin duda esa noche había traído consigo muchos reencuentros. … ¡Hola! Aquí estoy de nuevo dejándoles el capítulo 5. Ya no aguantaba la tensión y creo Troy y Gabriella tampoco. No tengo nada más que agregar, sólo que ya saben dónde pueden dejar su opinión. ¡Gracias! ~Luriana~'][Chapter 6] ['6. Far away La luz matutina atravesó la ventana alumbrando el cuerpo desnudo de Troy, este abrió los ojos lentamente y tardó unos segundos en entender dónde estaba y cuando lo hizo se sorprendió de no ver a Gabriella a su lado, esperó unos minutos pensando que estaba en el baño, pero pasados 10 comenzó a preocuparse. Se le hizo extraño que no estuviera, no sería capaz de dejarlo así y menos en su casa. Se preguntó si estaría desayunando, así que rápido se levantó de la cama, buscó su ropa y salió a buscarla mientras se abrochaba el pantalón. En la cocina sólo encontró a Ryan que preparaba un licuado, se miraron sorprendidos y soltaron una risa discreta. —Es para Kelsey—comentó apuntando hacia la licuadora. —¿Has visto a Gabriella? —preguntó Troy directamente y un poco apenado. Ryan lo miró sin entender cómo era había dormido con ella y ahora no sabía dónde estaba, pero Troy se encogió de hombros. —¿No le has hablado a su teléfono? —Lo dejó en la habitación. Justo en ese momento la puerta de la casa se abrió, Gabriella con guantes y gorra atravesó el umbral y se despojó de su chamarra de la que resaltaban algunos residuos de nieve. Los chicos la miraron y ella sólo alzó las cejas. —Ya está el licuado, iré a dárselo a Kelsey—comentó Ryan y desapareció corriendo. Troy miró a Gabriella que no le había dirigido la palabra, le incomodaba su actitud, tenían que hablar y era su costumbre alejarse, lo había hecho ya en varias ocasiones, pero esta vez tendría que ser diferente pues estaba en juego su futuro. —¿Qué pasa? —preguntó Gabriella al darse cuenta que este la miraba fijamente. —Eso te pregunto yo, pasamos la noche juntos y despierto y no estás. —Fui a correr—suspiró—necesitaba aclarar mis ideas. ¿También Ryan pasó aquí la noche? —Sí pero no me interesa hablar de Ryan, me interesa hablar de nosotros—ella lo miró pero no surgió ninguna palabra de su boca—Por amor de Dios, Gabriella. ¡Necesitamos hablar! Lo que pasó anoche fue importante para mí. —No grites—le pidió—los demás siguen durmiendo. Se sentó en el sofá haciendo para un lado la ropa que se acababa de quitar, Troy se hizo lo mismo. —Troy—le tomó la mano—estar contigo anoche fue maravilloso, hacía muchos años que no me sentía así. —Suspiró—Pero te lo dije el día de la cena, tenemos mundos diferentes y ni siquiera sé que sientes tú por mí. El joven le quitó un mechón de cabello de la oreja y le dio un beso en la sien. —Gabriella, han pasado 5 años en los que no he dejado de pensar en ti, en qué estás haciendo. Si no te busqué antes fue porque lo prometimos y porque quería que siguieras con tu vida. Pero este viaje me hizo darme cuenta tu sientes lo mismo que yo—volteó su rostro y posó sus labios sobre los de ella que no opuso resistencia alguna. Se mantuvieron así varios minutos, con las manos entrelazadas y separando sus rostros sólo para respirar, pero entonces ella empujó el pecho de Troy con las manos quedando sólo sus frentes una sobre otra. —Vives en Nueva York—cerró sus ojos—Estas en portada de revistas, besas a muchas chicas en escena, ¿Cómo encaja eso conmigo? Por eso salí a correr, porque estar contigo me hizo darme cuenta cuanto te extrañaba pero la realidad es otra Troy. Se separó de él. —Gracias por hacerme volver a sentir tanto en estos dos días, pero mi vuelo sale a las 5 de la tarde. Se levantó del sofá y caminó hacia las escaleras. —Te amo, Troy. Pero las cosas tienen que quedarse como están. El mencionado echó su cabeza para atrás mientras que Gabriella subía las escaleras rápidamente con algunas lágrimas en los ojos, las cuales no se contuvieron cuando estuvo sola en su habitación, deslizó su espalda en la puerta y comenzó a llorar. No era justo que volviera a pasar dos veces por el mismo dolor, no lo merecía, creyó poder sobre llevarlo pero no era así. Al salir de su habitación esa mañana, tenía la intención de llegar con una respuesta y por más que quiso decidirse a intentarlo nuevamente con él, el miedo la envolvió y no podía estar con ese sentimiento toda su vida, por más que quisiera a Troy. Pasaron dos horas aproximadamente y por fin pudo levantarse de su cama para empezar a empacar. Faltaban cuatro horas para que saliera su vuelo, apenas le daba tiempo de comer algo y salir al aeropuerto. Pensaba en llegar a casa con su mamá y ponerse al día con el trabajo, seguro estaría muy habría muchos pendientes al volver a la oficina, no recordaba en qué momento se había hecho un trabajo tan estable si ella sólo pensaba estar ahí hasta juntar un poco de dinero y montar su propio buffete. El sonido de la puerta interrumpió sus pensamientos. —¿Puedo pasar? Gabriella miró a Taylor en la puerta y le asintió con la cabeza, esta se puso a su lado y comenzó a ayudarle a doblar su ropa. —¿Estás consciente que ya cerrarán la puerta por siempre? —preguntó la morena sin recibir respuesta—¿Que jamás volverás a verlo? Excepto en las revistas que tanto dices. ¿Qué no lo quieres, Gabriella? —Mucho—respondió por fin. —¿Entonces? ¿Por qué lo dejaste ir? —la abrazó al ver que su amiga empezó a llorar de nuevo. —Porque tengo mucho miedo. Porque no sé qué pueda pasar. Porque sería darle un giro a mi vida y me aterra. —Mírame—le sujetó los hombros—toda tu vida le diste giros, cambiaste de escuela a otra, te fuiste a Stanford aún sin terminar el curso. ¿No crees que sea hora de empezar otra vez? ¿No quería tú poner un despacho? ¿Por qué no lo intentas? Taylor tenía razón, estaba aterrada del futuro sin ver que en el pasado había pasado ya por varias situaciones que requirieron de mucha valentía. —Mi avión sale a las 5—respondió Gabriella—y prácticamente le dije a Troy que no quería volver a saber nada de él, ¿Qué se supone debo hacer? —Ryan sigue abajo, Troy se está quedando en su casa. ¿Por qué no le dices lo que sientes? —aconsejó Taylor. —¿Por qué Ryan sigue aquí? —Taylor se encogió de hombros—¿Qué se supone hago con mi vuelo? —Salen cada dos horas a Illinoils, si no le podemos decir a Chad, tiene fans en todos lados igual consigue otro lugar. Gabriella asintió y fue al baño a retocarse los ojos. Al estar sola, Taylor sacó su celular. \" Va para allá\" … Tardó una hora en llegar a la casa de Sharpay, había llorado mucho en todo el camino. ¿Cómo era posible volver a perderla y no poder hacer nada para evitarlo? Gabriella era la persona que le había cambiado la vida y la que quería a su lado. Si tan solo ella entendiera que su trabajo no tenía nada que ver con lo que sentía por ella, que podían enfrentarlo todo si estaban juntos. ¿Por qué era tan obstinada? Al menos ese viaje le había servido para darse cuenta que entre ellos ya no podía haber nada, pero no se sentía contento en absoluto. Llegó a casa y se encontró con Sharpay haciendo yoga en el salón, no pudo no quebrarse ante ella y volvió a llorar esta lo abrazó y le recordó que esa era el riesgo que corría al verla de nuevo pero que al menos ya estaba seguro de que no había forma de seguir. —Es que ni siquiera es porque no me quiera, Sharpay—se quejó—dice que nuestras vidas no son compatibles y que beso a muchas chicas en escena. —No es fácil, Troy—dijo Joe que salió de la cocina—entiéndela, esta vida que ustedes los actores llevan es compleja. También yo dude mucho para salir con Sharpay, pero creo que nunca debe faltar la confianza y tú tienes que transmitírsela a ella. —¿Y cómo? Si ella se va hoy a Illinoils y dudo volver a verla. Hice todo lo que tenía que hacer, pero respetó su decisión. —Troy, yo puedo…—comenzó a decir Sharpay. —Sharpay, no—la cortó Troy—ya hiciste lo suficiente y te lo agradezco de verdad. Pero tengo que darle vuelta a la página, es lo que me has dicho desde que nos conocemos ¿no es así? El rubio camino hacía la habitación que estaba ocupando, no tenía caso seguir en Albuquerque, tomaría un avión a Nueva York y allá pasaría las fiestas, hablaría con sus padres por si lo querían visitar y volvería a ver a Sharpay hasta la nueva función en enero. Tocaron a su puerta tres veces. —Sharpay, no quiero hablar. Ignoraron sus palabras y tocaron dos veces más. Desesperado se tomó la manija y se sorprendió al ver a la persona del otro lado del umbral. —¿Qué haces aquí? … Escuchó todo el camino a Ryan hablar de cómo habían decidido internarlo nuevamente él y Kelsey, añadido a todas las cualidades de ella, pero no le estaba poniendo atención. Le sudaban las manos y el corazón le palpitaba rápidamente. Nunca había cambiado de decisiones tan rápido en su vida, pero ahora sí ya estaba segura de lo que sentía. Sharpay la esperaba en la puerta con los brazos cruzados. —Hola Sharpay—saludó Gabriella en cuanto se bajó del coche. —¿Estás segura de que esto es lo que quieres? —Preguntó la rubia—Porque tengo un amigo ahí adentro que esta por irse a Nueva York creyendo que jamás te volverá a ver. Porque eso le dejaste muy claro hace unas horas. —Oye, yo también estoy sufriendo—se justificó la morena. —Lo sé, por eso no entiendo a qué están jugando. Casi cumplen 30 años, Gabriella, creo que deberían empezar a comportarse como adultos. —Tú no entiendes… —Pero él sí—señaló a Joe—te presento a mi prometido, Joe McCarty—el mencionado saludó desde el sofá—si alguien sabe cómo es tener una relación con alguien de este medio, es él. Llevamos 3 años y créeme que las revistas y los besos en escena han sido nuestra menor preocupación. Segunda puerta a la izquierda. Gabriella no dijo nada más, siguió las indicaciones de Sharpay escuchando como esta regañaba a su hermano por no llegar a dormir y no avisar mientras este le contestaba que casi cumplían 30 años. Tocó tres veces a la puerta. —Sharpay, no quiero hablar—escuchó decir desde el interior. Ignoró sus palabras y tocó dos veces. Escuchó sus pasos acercarse y jalar la manija. —¿Qué haces aquí? —preguntó Troy. Ella no supo que contestar así que empezó a cantar una de sus canciones favoritas. — This time, this place misused, mistakes Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait? Just one chance, just one breath Just in case there\\'s just one left \\'Cause you know you know, you know That I love you I have loved you all along and I miss you Been far away for far too long I keep dreaming you\\'ll be with me and you\\'ll never go Stop breathing if I don\\'t see you anymore Troy se quedó callado así que ella siguió con la canción. — On my knees, I\\'ll ask last chance for one last dance \\'Cause with you, I\\'d withstand All of hell to hold your hand I\\'d give it all I\\'d give for us Give anything, but I won\\'t give up \\'Cause you know you know, you know. —¿Estas segura que no te rendirás? —preguntó el muchacho. Ella le tomó la mano y la nuca, se levantó en sus puntas y le besó. Troy se quedó quieto unos momentos, pero enseguida se dejó envolver por el beso de la chica y la tomó de la cintura. —Estoy aterrada—susurró ella—pero no quiero seguir haciendo una vida si no estás tú en ella. Su beso era tierno, estaban disfrutando del momento y ambos estaban respirando, por primera vez en mucho tiempo, con tranquilidad. —Quiero seguir bailando contigo—continuó Gabriella—y quiero esperarte en tu camerino después de cada función. —¿Qué pasa con tu trabajo? —Pienso que es hora de crear mi buffete. Entre el beso una sonrisa se formó entre ambos y él la abrazó tan fuerte que la levantó del piso. Tendrían tiempo para planear su futuro, ya verían como se las arreglarían y sin duda una larga conversación les haría falta dentro de poco. Pero mientras estaban ahí, disfrutando de su momento y de sus labios, sintiendo que era, otra vez, el inicio de algo nuevo. …. ¡Hola! Aquí les dejo este nuevo capítulo, ya está por terminar la historia. Me habían dicho que la hiciera un poco más larga, sin embargo toda la idea fue pensada como una película (HSM 4) y no quisiera arruinarle metiéndole más cosas. Pero podría escribir otra pensándola a más capítulos. La canción que canta Gabriella es Far Away de Nickelback Espero que les haya gustado, sinceramente no fue mi capitulo favorito y casi no tenía inspiración. Pero cualquier comentario, queja o sugerencia, ya saben dónde dejarlo. ¡Mil gracias! ~Luriana~'][Chapter 7] ['7. Lay with me El avión volaba a más de 3,000 pies de altura. En efecto Chad había logrado la compra de dos boletos para Illinoils pues el gerente en turno era un fiel seguidor de los Nets de Nueva Jersey. Gabriella miraba por la ventana mientras con la mano de Troy sobre su rodilla. Faltaba medio viaje de camino pero ninguno de los dos quería que ese momento acabara. Salieron la casa de Sharpay después de volver a hacer el amor en menos de 24 horas, se besaron, se abrazaron y piel con piel se aferraron a la idea de que lo volverían a intentar. —Tengo mucho miedo, Troy—comentó Gabriella mientras pasaba las yemas de sus dedos por el pecho desnudo de su acompañante. —Ey, nada va a pasar—se puso de costado para verla de frente y acarició su barbilla—Te amo, Gabriella, nunca olvides eso. Besó su nariz y después sus labios para que después ella se subiera en él y sin espacio alguno entre sus cuerpos, volvieron a estar juntos. Cinco años habían tenido que pasar para que volvieran a ser uno, a mezclar sus aromas y a entrelazar sus manos para juntos alcanzar el cielo. Después de varias horas de encierro, decidieron viajar a Illinoils juntos, pues a Gabriella se le acababan las vacaciones de su trabajo y Troy no la dejaría ir sola. Salieron entre risas de la habitación que Sharpay les había dejado con la maleta en una mano y en la otra la mano del otro. —Nos vamos—le dijo Troy a su amiga—Sharpay, todo esto te lo debemos a ti. Joe, gracias por todo—lo abrazó. —Sharpay—Gabriella le tomó la mano—sé que nunca hemos sido amigas, pero gracias por hacer esto, de verdad. La rubia se encogió de hombros. —Creo que todos merecemos una segunda oportunidad y más ustedes, que su amor siempre estuvo delante de todo. Y también que ya me voy a casar y no puedo estar cuidando más de Troy. Joe se acercó a abrazar su prometida. —Los veremos en la boda, ¿cierto? —preguntó este. —Por supuesto que sí—afirmó Troy. Se despidió de un abrazo de ambos y Gabriella lo imitó para después ir a la casa donde el resto de los Linces se encontraban y agradecerle de la misma forma que a los Evans, todo lo que habían hecho esa semana por ellos, que aunque muchas veces quisieron matarlos al final habían logrado que volvieran a estar juntos. Tanto como Chad y Taylor, acompañaron a los reconciliados al aeropuerto para poder conseguir los boletos del avión. —Supongo que nos veremos pronto—se despidió Taylor abrazando a Gabriella. —Si vas a verme la próxima temporada yo iré a echarte flores a tus obras—le dijo Chad a Troy mientras los acompañaba a la puerta de abordaje—Gabriella, siempre es un placer verte. —Gracias por los boletos—sonrió la morena. —¿Dónde planean vivir? —preguntó Taylor. —Apenas lo decidiremos—respondió Troy—mientras tanto tendremos que hablar con nuestros padres. Se despidieron nuevamente y caminaron de la mano hacia la sala de espera para poder partir hacia el hogar de Gabriella. Durante la espera, platicaron muchas cosas, aunque ya habían tenido un buen adelanto, sin embargo Gabriella le dio más detalles de cómo había entrado a la empresa donde hoy trabajaba y cómo a veces quería renunciar. Troy a su vez, le platicó de sus primeros castings y como Grease le había presentado una nueva oportunidad. Gabriella despejó sus ojos de la ventana cuando la sobrecargo les ofreció algo de tomar y después de ingerir algunas frituras, durmió profundamente en el pecho de Troy. … —Hija, que bueno que llegaste—gritó Lisa desde el piso superior de la casa y bajó corriendo la escalera—¿Troy? —Hola, mamá—se acercó a darle un beso dejando las llaves en la mesa, Lisa respondió el beso sin dejar de mirar a Troy que estaba recargado en la puerta. —Te presentaría a Troy pero creo que ya lo conoces. —Señora Montez—agachó la cabeza. —¿Alguien me puede decir qué está pasando aquí? Troy y Gabriella sonrieron y se sentaron, invitando a la señora a hacer lo mismo y después de tomar un vaso con agua, se pusieron al corriente, qué había pasado en Albuquerque y que pasaría ahora. —Me iré a Nueva York—respondió Gabriella tomando la mano de Troy—tengo el dinero suficiente para poner ahora el despacho que tanto anhelé. Lisa asintió tratando de entender la decisión de su hija. La había visto sufrir tanto por Troy y después fue testigo de todos los esfuerzos de esta para superarlo. Por eso estaba feliz de que volviera a intentarlo aunque, al igual que su hija, el miedo la invadía. Y así se lo dejó saber a ella cuando Troy fue a la cocina a lavar los trastes. —¿Segura que es lo que quieres, Gabriella? —preguntó su mamá mientras terminaban de limpiar la mesa. —Lo amo mucho y sé que él a mí—sonrió la muchacha—con eso, creo podemos contra todo. —Pero también se amaban hace 5 años —le recordó—y no quiero que pases por lo mismo. Gabriella tomó la mano de su mamá. —No volverá a pasar, tanto él como yo estamos dispuestos a no dejarnos vencer otra vez. Lisa asintió y ambas voltearon su rostro cuando Troy salió de la cocina y les comentó que justo acababa de colgar con sus padres y estos llegarían al día siguiente a Illinoils. —Oh se pueden quedar aquí sin problema—sugirió la señora Montez al escuchar que los padres de Troy se quedarían en un hotel. —Tenemos habitaciones suficientes y asumo tú te quedarás con Gabriella. ¿O me equivocó? —continuó. Gabriella se puso roja pero fue al lado de Troy para abrazarlo y ambos asintieron. Se acercaba Navidad y habían acordado que la pasarían los cinco juntos, tampoco los señores Bolton entendían muy bien ese regreso tan precipitado. Se supone que sus hijos sólo irían a una reunión de ex alumnos y ahora regresaban con la noticia de que estaban por irse a vivir juntos. Después de más horas de plática entre los tres, Troy y Gabriella optaron por ir a descansar pues el día había sido muy largo, sin embargo descansar no era lo que tenían en mente. Justo llegaron a la habitación de Gabriella, esta lo lanzó sobre su cama colocándose encima de él sin dejar de besarlo. Quería tenerlo muy cerca para poder susurrarle cada palabra. —Te extrañé mucho, Bolton. Pero él no respondió la tomó de la cintura y comenzó a besar su cuello, sus hombros, la despojó de su blusa para seguirla besando. Ella enredó sus manos en ese cabello dorado que tanto le gustaba y comenzó a dibujar con besos sobre su piel ya desnuda. No sabían bien a donde los llevarían las nuevas decisiones que habían tomado pero cada caricia era oro para ambos. Sentían la necesidad de estar unidos, atraídos como si uno fuera la gravedad del otro. No les importaba el tiempo ni el frio que hacía en el exterior. No dejarían la habitación a menos que fuera realmente necesario, como lo fue la mañana siguiente que llegaron los padres de Troy. Pero al menos toda la noche querían que sólo fuera de ellos, ya habían esperado lo suficiente. … ¡Hola! Les dejo este capítulo que está muy cortito pero me inspiré en la canción Lay with me de Vanessa Hudgens. Así que si pueden volver a leer la parte final con esa canción de fondo verán lo que sentí. Estamos ya en los capítulos finales así que espero les siga gustando y si no ya saben dónde comentarlo. Nota: Publicaré una historia Zanessa en Wattpad ya que Fanfiction no lo permite y soy ñoña y cumplo las reglas así que si me quieren seguir en Wattpad mi nombre es: Luriiana y mi cuenta en IG de HSM es TeamHudgensMX. Ahí estaré dando detalles. ¡Mil gracias!'][Chapter 8] [\"8.- A Thousand years El ruido en la sala despertó a Troy y se sorprendió que pasaban de las once de la mañana, menos mal era domingo y eran vacaciones para él, cosa que no eran para Gabriella y que tenía que ir a trabajar al día siguiente. Ella seguía dormida y él besó su cabellera alborotada. —No recordaba durmieras tanto—le susurró en su oído y ella estiró su mano para alejarle la cara. —Es aún de madrugada—se quejó la muchacha. Troy leyó un mensaje en su celular donde su madre le decía ya estaban en la casa de Gabriella, como él les había pedido. —¿Pasa algo? —preguntó Gabriella al ver a su novio en el teléfono. —Mis papás están aquí. Sin perder un segundo ambos se levantaron corriendo. Gabriella prefirió darse un baño antes de bajar mientras Troy sólo se vistió y bajó a saludar a sus papás que lo miraron con desaprobación. —¿Cómo te quedas a dormir con Gabriella en casa de su mamá? —lo reprendió su papá —Oh descuiden—habló Lisa tomando un jugo—soy una madre moderna. La familia Bolton escuchó la historia de Albuquerque, como Sharpay los había llevado hasta esa situación y cómo ahora estaba muy feliz por haber recuperado a Gabriella. —¿Y están seguros que eso es lo que quieren? —preguntó Lucille—¿A pesar de sus trabajos tan diferentes? —Sí mamá—asintió Troy—sabemos que será un poco complicado, pero estamos dispuestos a correr el riesgo. Los padres de Troy asintieron y se encogieron de hombros, su hijo ya era lo suficientemente mayor para tomar sus propias decisiones. —Aquí tienes lo que me pediste—le dijo su padre extendiéndole una caja pequeña—no fue fácil de encontrar, tuve que hurgar en todos tus cajones. —Te dije estaba en la cómoda, junto a todas las cosas de ella—le recordó Troy. —Sí, lo olvidé y fue el último lugar que busqué. Gabriella, buenos días. La recién mencionada bajaba por la escalera dando ciertos brinquitos entre escalón y escalón, lo cual provocó una sonrisa en Troy, seguía siendo la misma. Saludó a sus suegros con un abrazó, también a ellos los había extrañado mucho. Y posteriormente tomó la mano de Troy para sentarse en la mesa y poder desayunar. Hablaron nuevamente de los planes que tenían para el futuro. Sólo esperarían que terminara el año y que Gabriella pudiera renunciar, que no era algo fácil de hacer pues era una empresa que le había dado todo lo que ahora tenía, sin embargo tenía poco más de un año que se sentía en su zona de confort y como ahora en Albuquerque había recordado su sueño de abrir su propio despacho de abogados. El día se les fue comprando cosas para la cena de Noche Buena que estaba por ocurrir el siguiente miércoles, recorrieron también la ciudad de Illinoils y ambas familias se pusieron al corriente de lo que había pasado en los últimos años. Aunque realmente lo que les intrigaba era que Troy los hubiera echo ir a Illioils tan desesperadamente, pero creían conocer la respuesta. Pues aunque su hijo tuvo dudas de muchas cosas toda su vida, el amor hacia Gabriella no era un de ellas. Cuando llegó la noche y apareció la luna Troy invitó a Gabriella a cenar. —Mañana trabajo, Troy—le dijo ella —Por favor, regresamos temprano—pidió con las manos unidas. Y ella solo sonrió, no podía resistirse a esos ojos azules cuando le pedían algo, así que accedió y solamente fue a cambiar de ropa para después encaminarse hacia el restaurant. El clima en el exterior era frio, los copos de nieves se deshacían sobre su ropa y ambos tenían que cubrirse. Sin embargo el lugar no estaba lejos de la casa de Gabriella así que pudieron llegar caminando sin problema. —¿Un canta bar? ¿Enserio? —preguntó Gabriella al llegar—¿Qué tú no te cansas de cantar nunca? —Oye quien te dijo que vamos a cantar—se rió mientras movía la silla para que se sentara su novia—además yo era un basquetbolista hasta que hace poco más de diez años una persona me convenció de cantar en un karaoke un año nuevo. Gabriella reclamó —Yo no te convencí de nada… —Hablaba del chico del hotel, no de ti—Gabriella torció la boca—pero ahora que lo mencionas, después de eso una señorita de otro mundo llegó a East High a decirme que cantará con ella en un musical. —Sí te forcé mucho—respondió sarcástica—no entiendo cómo Sharpay es tu amiga si le quitaste el protagónico de su obra. —Por eso no es la tuya, tú se lo quitaste—le recordó y esta le aventó una servilleta, pero est4e le tomó la mano y le besó los dedos—¿Alguna vez imaginaste que volveríamos a estar así? La muchacha suspiró. —Si te soy sincera, no lo pensé porque no me quería hacer ilusiones. ¿Y tú? —Algo parecido, nunca dejé de pensar en ti pero te veía ajena a mi vida. Más cuando recordaba que incluso ya podríamos habernos casado. Gabriella sonrió dejando ver cierta tristeza en su rostro. —El día que te mandé el anillo por correspondencia lloré demasiado, me costó mucho hacerme a la idea que ese día en Disneylandia no había sido el más hermoso ni el comienzo de una nueva historia. Cada que lo recordaba solo lloraba, así que decidí olvidarlo—suspiró— Y no fue lo más lindo cuando salió en mis recuerdos de Facebook. Troy se acercó a ella, le quitó los cabellos de la cara y le beso la mejilla. —Y, ¿quisieras el anillo de vuelta? —¿De qué hablas? —se sorprendió Gabriella. El ruido en el restaurant estalló dado que una pareja que estaba en el escenario había terminado de cantar. —¿Quiénes serán nuestras siguientes víctimas? —preguntó un hombre que caminaba entre las mesas con un micrófono. —Gabriella, creo que ya estamos lo suficientemente grandes y que sabemos exactamente lo que queremos. La morena abrió la boca pero no pudo responder ya que una luz alumbró su mesa y el hombre del micrófono se acercó a ellos. —Sí, ustedes son nuestras siguientes víctimas. Todos comenzaron a aplaudir y Troy pidió a Gabriella lo acompañará al centro del escenario. La melodía comenzó a sonar y muchos recuerdos vinieron a la mente de Gabriella, claramente se vio así misma el año nuevo de 2006 cantando junto a un desconocido que ahora era el amor de su vida, recordó como su corazón latió cuando lo vio en su nueva escuela y sonrió al recordar todas sus canciones juntos. Las letras aparecieron en la pantalla frente a ellos y ella comenzó la canción. — Heart beats fast Colors and promises How to be brave How can I love when I'm afraid to fall But watching you stand alone All of my doubt, suddenly goes away somehow One step closer I have died everyday, waiting for you Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more Y Troy siguió la canción, como siempre que tuvieron que cantar juntos. — Time stands still Beauty in all she is I will be brave I will not let anything, take away What's standing in front of me Every breath, every hour has come to this One step closer I have died everyday, waiting for you Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more Y juntos como siempre lo habían hecho, terminaron cantando a duo. — And all along I believed, I would find you Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more One step closer One step closer I have died everyday, waiting for you Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you for a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more And all along I believed, I would find you Time has brought your heart to me, I have loved you for a thousand years I'll love you for a thousand more Los aplausos no faltaron, se miraron a los ojos y aún con el micrófono encendido Troy se hincó y sacó una pequeña caja de su bolsillo. —Ya te perdí una vez y no pienso volver a hacerlo—tomó aire—Gabriella Montez, por segunda vez en mi vida ¿Te quieres casar conmigo? ….. ¡Ah! Hasta aquí llega este capítulo. ¿Cuál creen sea la respuesta de Gabriella? Ya saben dónde comentarlo.

El ex capitán del equipo estaba dando vueltas en la entrada de del salón y al parecer no escuchó a su amigo —¿Qué puede salir mal? —Continuó—en unas horas Gabriella será tu esposa. Lo que han soñado desde hace 11 años. En tacones y un abrigo de piel, Sharpay llegó del brazo de su novio a saludar Troy. —Qué idea tan ordinaria casarse tan rápido, en Año Nuevo y en hotel—le dio un beso en la mejilla y lo abrazó. —No queríamos esperar más—contestó Troy—Pensé que no vendrías. La rubia rodó los ojos. —Por mí están hoy aquí, no lo olvides. Pero sigo sin entender como alcanzaron lugar en el hotel en esta fecha. Y por qué tuvieron que regresar al Oeste de Estados Unidos si ya estaban en Illinoils. —Queríamos que fuera aquí en Colorado, ya sabes, primer encuentro—se ruborizó Troy. —Que cursi eres, Troy—le dio un golpe en el hombro y después sonrió—pero me alegro que por fin estén aquí. —Gracias a ustedes—abrazó a Chad—y ti amigo, por conseguir espacio en el hotel. El moreno se encogió de hombros. —Te dije que tendrías más privilegios si te volvías basquetbolista, aún no eres Brad Pitt. Ryan se abrió pasó entre la multitud para avisarle a Troy tenía que tomar su lugar y lo mismo para el resto de los pocos invitados, En realidad había muy pocas personas, los padres de Troy y los de Gabriella obviamente estaban en primera fila. Chad que había decidido fuera su padrino, Sharpay y Joe que acababan de llegar y Martha que también había sido invitada por Gabriella. Que la ceremonia se realizará justo semana y media después de volver de Albuquerque había tomado a todos por sorpresa y siendo en Año Nuevo solamente lo más cercanos pudieron confirmar su asistencia. Además que Gabriella había querido fuera así, pues agregó que probablemente los medios se enterarían y no quería que desde el día de su relación se viera inmiscuidas en notas de revistas. Troy caminó hacia el altar acomodándose la corbata y recordó como su futura esposa le había enseñado a anudarla tiempo atrás justo el día que la invitó al baile de graduación y esta respondió: —En el idioma que quieras, sí, yes, oui, hai. Misma frase que había repetido dos semanas atrás cuando en medio de un karaoke él se hinco y ella con lágrimas en los ojos le volvió a decir lo mismo que cuando a los 17 años la invitó al baile de graduación. Y ahora, lo que creía imposible se revelaba contra ante sus ojos, Gabriella en la puerta del salón lucía un lindo vestido que tuvo que ir a buscar en un fin de semana, pero lucia hermosa. Su cabello negro recogido, sus ojos cafés que tenían un brillo natural resaltaban de sus mejillas rosadas. Lo que sentía por ella era más que amor, la admiraba y estaba seguro que quería pasar el resto de su vida a su lado. … Frente al espejo sonrió mientras Kelsey y Taylor le acomodaban el cabello. Como habían cambiado las cosas en tan solo un mes; pero parecía como si todas las piezas se habían unido, pues justamente el día que Taylor le habló para preguntarle si iría a Albuquerque tuvo un día en el trabajo que le hizo pensar si realmente quería seguir ahí pues aunque era la mejor abogada de la empresa y le tenían buenas consideraciones ella no se sentía ya del todo a gusto. Al día siguiente de que Troy le pidiera que se casara con él, Gabriella volvió a la oficina decidida a renunciar, lo que sorprendió a todos al igual que verla con un anillo en el dedo pues no era secreto que dedicaba toda su vida al trabajo. Su jefa se extrañó y le pidió lo recapacitará pero esta le contó sus planes de emprender y le agradeció el haberle dado las herramientas necesarias para hacerlo, por lo que a su jefa sólo le quedó asentir y desearle lo mejor en su nueva vida. Y vaya que era una nueva, pues iniciaría el 2019 con proyecto de emprender y casada con el amor de su vida a quien hacía 5 años no veía y creía haber perdido. No podía con tanta felicidad, lo que le externó a sus amigas y estas le dijeron que su felicidad era contagiosa y que se alegraban mucho por ellos, pues nadie lo merecía más. Su madre también estaba con ellas en la habitación que habían rentado. —Quien diría que volveríamos a este hotel después de 12 años y que te casarías con el chico con el que cantaste en esa fiesta a la que no querías ir. —Gracias por convencerme de ir. Su madre le dio un beso y le dijo que la veía en el salón, mientras sus amigas terminaban de arreglarla y colocarle el colguije de la T en el cuello. Al igual que su madre, su amiga Kelsey dejó la habitación pues tenía que prepararse para la entrada de la novia. Taylor ayudó a acomodar los últimos detalles, el brillo en los labios, la corona en el cabello y el cierre del vestido. Se colocó las zapatillas y justo antes de tomar el ramo, abrazó a su amiga. —No sé cómo agradecerte esto, Tay. La morena se encogió de hombros. —Solo les dimos un empujón, esto ya estaba escrito, de alguna manera u otra iba a suceder—Taylor le cogió la mano—ahora vamos, el novio debe de estar ansioso por verte. Llegó al salón y las puertas se abrieron, Chad se acercó para darle el brazo y ella lo pudiera tomar para ser llevada hasta el altar donde Troy se encontraba mirándola fijamente. El piano comenzó a sonar por los dedos de Kelsey, sabía que tenía una canción prepara para ellos pero no pensó fuera aquella que les compuso para que cantarán en Lava Spring hacia años, Troy también pareció sorprendido y ambos les dio nostalgia esa canción. Y a ese ritmo, caminó lentamente para tomar la mano de su novio. — Together we\\'re gonna sing —dijo en voz baja al llegar al altar. — We got the power to say what with feel —le extendió la mano Troy. —Bien, podemos dar inició a esta ceremonia—anunció el padre. Los allegados a la pareja escucharon atentamente las palabras del padre y a algunos se les escurrieron las lágrimas al escucharlos decir \"Sí acepto\" después de sus votos: —Troy, has dicho muchas veces que yo te ayudé a definir tu futuro y cambié tu vida, pero tú no hiciste menos con la mía, estaba cansada de ir de lugar en lugar sin poder establecerme, tú me hiciste crear lazos en un sitio por primera vez, hacer de Albuquerque mi hogar por estar tú ahí. Tu fe me dio fuerza para creer que no había estrella que no pudiéramos alcanzar. Y sé que estando juntos todo será más fácil. —Gabriella, hace 11 años estuvimos aquí, hiciste la mejor noche de Año Nuevo y me enseñaste que los deseos se cumplen, porque justo después de las 12 campanadas deseé volver a verte, porque desde ese instante supe que solo podía ser quien era, estando contigo. Abriste nuevas ilusiones, sueños esperanzas y es por ti que hoy puedo ser quien soy. Hace poco volví a desear lo mismo, verte de nuevo. Y hoy nos estamos casando. Ambos sonrieron —Señorita Montes, ¿acepta a Troy Bolton por esposo y promete serle fiel, amarlo en la riqueza y la pobreza, en la saludad y en la enfermedad, hasta que la muerte los separe? —Sí, acepto. —Señor Bolton, ¿acepta por esposa a Gabriella Montes y promete serle fiel, amarlo en la riqueza y la pobreza, en la saludad y en la enfermedad, hasta que la muerte los separe? —Sí, acepto. —Que lo que Dios ha unido no lo separe el hombre. Las parejas, Joe y Sharpay, Taylor y Chad, se sujetaron fuertemente al sentir la emoción de verlos besarse cuando el padre se los permitió. Tomados de la mano, salieron al ritmo de otra canción conocida de Kelsey, esta ocasión fue su dueto para el musical de graduación, les extrañó que la compositora no hubiera puesto algo nuevo para la ceremonia, pero asumían quería que ambos recordaran cuando cantaban juntos. … Entraron todos al salón a la pequeña cena que tenían reservada para ellos 12, en realidad les había costado muchos dieran exclusividad a ellos, pero todos invirtieron en aquel acto, pues a nadie le iba mal económicamente y el evento lo ameritaba. La sala tenía una puerta que daba al exterior por lo que al terminar de cenar y justo dos minutos antes de las doce salieron para que sus cabellos quedaran cubiertos de copos de nieve. —12, 11…—continuaron con la cuenta regresiva sujetando una copa en su mano y la de su pareja en la otra—3, 2, 1. Los fuegos artificiales resplandecieron en el cielo, muchos colores se dejaron ver en formas de chispas que se vieron reflejadas en los ojos de las personas que celebraban una boda. A la mente de Troy y Gabriella llegaron las imágenes de ellos mismos en ese lugar, pero esta vez podían hacer algo que, aunque lo desearon mucho, no era apropiado hacer 11 años atrás. Así que sin pensarlo él la tomó de la cintura y la besó apasionadamente inclinándola hacia atrás y aunque sus labios estaban fríos ellos comenzaron a sentir mucho calor. Después de varios segundos lograron separarse y ella tomó su mano para guiarlo dentro de la habitación, mientras con señas les indicaba a los demás lo siguieran. Kelsey ya estaba adentro con unos discos sobre una mesa, Gabriella soltó la mano de Troy y le pidió se quedará ahí después de darle un beso. —Nunca quise dedicarme a nada que tuviera que ver con las artes escenicas—confesó—pero al estar contigo nuevamente recordé cuanto me encantaba hacerlo. Pudo percatarse como Sharpay rodó los ojos, pero eso no le impidió llegar con Kelsey a decirle estaba lista, su amiga le dio un micrófono y así comenzó a cantar: — My chest broken in half Head rush right from the start Oh no, I don\\'t wanna let it show Undress all of my doubts Naked with or without no clothes And I don\\'t even feel that cold Sus amigos sonrieron y empezaron a aplaudir. — Just the thought of letting go Makes me wanna pull you closer Close enough so you can whisper every word Run your fingers through my hair Drawing picture on my shoulders Waiting for the time for you to say it first Se acercó a Troy y lo jaló de la corbata para que bailara con ella. — I want you to la-a-ay with me I don\\'t know where this is going Every time we touch it\\'s gold Want you to la-a-ay with me Nothing can be left unspoken Every time we touch it\\'s golden Comenzó a caminar por la pista para que Troy la siguiera tronando los dedos. — Bed sheets cover the floor Bodies keeping us warm all night We don\\'t have no sense of time You\\'re like adrenaline rushing through my bloodstream Is this love? \\'Cause I can\\'t seem to get enough Just the thought of letting go Makes me wanna pull you closer Close enough so you can whisper every word Run your fingers through my hair Drawing picture on my shoulders Waiting for the time for you to say it first I want you to la-a-ay with me I don\\'t know where this is going Every time we touch it\\'s gold Want you to la-a-ay with me Nothing can be left unspoken Every time we touch it\\'s golden Y sin terminar la canción se colgó sobre sus hombros y sintió sus brazos rodearle la cintura para cerrar ese número musical con un beso. La boda tenía que terminar rápido para cada quien poder volver a su habitación, a ellos más que a nadie les urgía. Sin embargo el beso tuvo que terminar porque una voz que hacia años no escuchaban, comenzó a cantar mientras abrazaba a Troy por los hombros. — If you love somebody Better tell them why they\\'re here \\'cause They just may run away from you You\\'ll never know what went well Then again it just depends on How long of time is left for you —cantó Chad. —No sabía que siguieras cantando—le gritó Troy por la música. —Es tu boda, amigo. — I\\'ve had the highest mountains I\\'ve had the deepest rivers You can have it all but not til you move it Now take it in but don\\'t look down —continuó Taylor tomando la mano de Chad. Y sorprendentemente todos los Linces que alguna vez habían bailado juntos, estaban haciéndolo nuevamente en la boda de quien los había unido. — \\'Cause I\\'m on top of the world, \\'ey I\\'m on top of the world, \\'ey Waiting on this for a while now Paying my dues to the dirt I\\'ve been waiting to smile, \\'ey Been holding it in for a while, \\'ey Take it with me if I can Been dreaming of this since a child I\\'m on top of the world Y por lo mismo, Sharpay no podía no cantar con ellos: — I\\'ve tried to cut these corners Try to take the easy way out I kept on falling short of something I coulda gave up then but Then again I couldn\\'t have \\'cause I\\'ve traveled all this way for something Now take it in but don\\'t look down Los padres de los novios sólo veían y sonreían al ver a sus hijos disfrutando tanto de algo como cuando tenían 17 años mientras volvían a cantar el coro de esa canción que sus hijos corearon tanto. La reunión duró aproximadamente una hora más, donde siguieron bailando al ritmo de la orquesta y Gabriella lanzó su ramo, el cuál le cayó a Sharpay. —¿Puedes perdonarme lo del musical de invierno? —preguntó la novia mordiéndose el labio. —Sí, yo ahora salgo en revistas y tu sacas empresas del hoyo, creo cada quien debe de estar—bromeó Sharpay—¿Te veo en mi boda? Gabriella asintió y ambas chicas se abrazaron, ya no estaban en la prepa ni tenían que competir para un protagónico. Además una era la esposa del mejor amigo de la otra, era necesario se llevaran bien. Gabriella recordó que Troy había estado con la rubia, pero ya en ese momento le importaba poco, porque finalmente esos actos la habían llevado hasta donde estaban ese día. Se despidieron con un abrazo de todos y agradecieron infinitamente el que les hubieran podido acompañar y hacer posible ese sueño. Empezaba el 2019 con nueva vida para ambos, algo que no creían ya posible, pero sí de algo estaban seguros era que su historia parecía sacada de una canción de amor, ambos tenían 16 cuando se conocieron y por cosas del destino fueron compañeros de escuela. Su mente se volvió un caleidoscopio de recuerdos al caminar del salón a su habitación, bueno Troy caminaba, ella iba en sus brazos sujetándolo del cuello. A pesar que su relación tuvo muchos impedimentos, empezando por sus amigos y no apoyada por sus padres pues supuestamente ambos se descentraban de su futuro por estar con el otro, era tan real que no podía ocultarse. Fueron un hermoso amor de juventud que se había visto apagado por los futuros de ambos, sin embargo al encontrarse nuevamente supieron que ese tiempo distanciado sólo había ayudado a incrementar el amor y la admiración que el uno sentía por el otro. Y así era como comenzaban a escribir su nueva historia, su nueva canción, cerrando la puerta de la habitación y poniendo un letrero que decía: \" Recién casados no molestar\". FIN … ¡Hola! Pues así llega el final de esta historia, aunque falta el epílogo. Perdón si al llegar aquí ya están empalagados pero por más que lo intenté no pude hacerlo menos cursi ni menos musical. Al ser capítulo final quise recrear varias frases, canciones y momentos de las 3 películas, pues esta historia para mí es HSM 4 y no hay más. Por favor, déjenme un comentario diciendo que les pareció y si quieren leer mi nueva historia Zanessa estará en wattpad y me pueden buscar como Luriiana. Gracias infinitas a todos y en especial a: Eri, por quitarle horas productivas a su trabajo para leer la historia o darme ideas. Ale y Vane por escuchar mis tonteras y recordarme lo mucho que amo Zanessa. Gracias, gracias, gracias. (El epilogó se publica el siguiente domingo) ¿Review? ~Luriana~'][Chapter 10] ['Epilogo Las cámaras y los micrófonos se acercaron rápidamente a la pareja que salía de la iglesia, Grease en Brodway había sido un éxito y a los actores se les habían presentado nuevas oportunidades por lo que regularmente viajaban, pero ese día todos se encontraban en Nueva York. Sharpay salía de la iglesia sonriendo y saludando a las cámaras, del brazo de su esposo y seguida por su hermano y familia. Su rostro no se podía ver más radiante y eso pudo identificar Gabriella y entenderla, pues hacia poco más de un año que ella había estado en la misma situación. Había tenido la oportunidad de platicar con ella después de varias funciones de Grease y Troy tenía razón, era agradable, egoísta y un poco frívola, pero sincera. Y podía ver en sus ojos como lo feliz que era casándose y sonriendo ante la cámara, así que se alegraba por ella. Los reporteros se acercaron a tomar fotos y a llenarla de preguntas. —Sharpay, Sharpay, ¿Qué sigue para ustedes? —Sharpay, ¿Dónde planean hacer la luna de miel? —Sharpay, aquí, ¿Planean tener familia pronto? Cientos de personas los acorralaban, lo mismo a Troy que sujetaba la mano de Gabriella y esta sólo trataba de caminar rápido. —Troy, nos sorprendió mucho verte con alguien —¿Troy es verdad que te casaste el año pasado a escondidas? El mencionado se detuvo después de que su esposa asintiera. —Sí, nos casamos y somos muy felices, muchas gracias. Pero la novia está allá y les apuesto le gustará tener exclusividad en su programa. —Claro, claro—respondió una periodista—pero es sólo que de ti no sabemos nada. —Sí y así será. Caminaron rápidamente hacia la camioneta de Troy mientras los periodistas se quejaban delante de las cámaras que Troy Bolton no quería dar declaraciones pero al que menos sabían que los rumores de su matrimonio eran ciertos. Troy encendió su camioneta, con una mano sujetó el volante y la otra la colocó en la pierna de Gabriella. —¿Todo bien? —preguntó el chico a su novia que se retocaba los labios para ir a la celebración de la boda de Sharpay. —Sí, se aprende a vivir con esto—sonrió entrelazando sus dedos en la mano de Troy. Su camioneta siguió a toda la corte de Sharpay para llegar al jardín donde se llevaría a cabo la fiesta. Era un lugar enorme con más de 10,000 invitados, nada que ver con la boda celebrada un año atrás. Aquí había alfombra roja, reporteros esperando en la entrada, cientos de meseros portando bocadillos y bebidas. Las letras A & J estaban a mitad del jardín con luces en el centro junto a un lago. En algún otro momento Gabriella se hubiera sentido incomoda pero ya se estaba acostumbrando a ese tipo de reuniones y más al rodearse de gente que conocía previamente por Troy. La fiesta fue muy buena y los medios se retiraron una vez que le tomaron ciento de fotos a los recién casados. Por lo que a pesar de todo, se sintió un ambiente familiar y cercano. Incluso Gabriella y Sharpay parecían haber olvidado sus rencores adolecentes pues cuando la segunda tuvo que ir al baño, fue la esposa de Troy quien le ayudó a recoger su largo y pesado vestido. Pasadas de las dos de la mañana, Troy y Gabriella se despidieron de los novios. —Ahora que acabó Grease, espero nos sigamos viendo. —Sabes que sí, Troy—le respondió Joe—son bienvenidos a nuestra casa, aunque ahora con la filmación de tu nueva película veo un poco difícil que tengas tiempo. —Sin contar que Gabriella tiene sesenta casos pendientes—agregó Sharpay—pero aun así son bienvenidos cuando quieran. —De igual manera saben que siempre pueden ir a nuestra casa. Después de darse un abrazo y felicitarlos por las fiesta y su unión matrimonial, Troy y Gabriella esperaron a que les entregaran su camioneta, ella temblaba de frio a causa de su vestido escotado, por lo que Troy se quitó su saco y la cubrió con sus brazos a lo que ella respondió con un beso. Su año de matrimonio había sido excepcional, los problemas que pronosticaron por causa de sus profesiones tan diferentes nunca se materializaron en su vida juntos, el despacho de Gabriella cada vez iba mejor, su ex jefa la había canalizado con varios clientes en Nueva York que la contactaron inmediatamente y de hecho ya tenía a dos personas trabajando para ella. Toda la temporada de Grease estuvo aplaudiendo los bailes de Troy y dejó de importarle que se besará con Sharpay porque entendió sólo estaba trabajando. Troy por su parte, había audicionado para una película musical junto con Hugh Jackman y había sido seleccionado, por lo que le tocaba estar de viaje muchos días. Llegaron a su departamento y a pesar de la hora, su perrito los esperaba despierto y los siguió hasta su habitación donde se dispusieron a descansar pues ambos tenían mucho trabajo para el día siguiente. … ¡Hola! Tenía que escribir este capítulo como epilogo donde se viera su vida después de casados. Ahora sí, con esto termina la historia y les agradezco todo su apoyo en estos 10 capitulos. Ana, Fiorella y Paola muchas gracias por apoyarme, seguir la historia y darme sus comentarios.

I've had this in my head for quite a while and have been working on getting it ready!

(Pop sound, picture of Earth) You start off as a baby, knowing absolutely nothing and free of all responsibility! Why free of all responsibility you ask? (Blonde baby, cute giggling sound) Well, I\\'m going to be honest, I don\\'t know why you would ask that, but I\\'ll give you the answer: You were free of all responsibility, because your parents were practically your slaves! (Pop sound, picture of a younger Jack and Lucille Bolton, Lucille holding an infant Troy) You told them when to wake up... (Troy crying, Lucille looking frazzled) \"Troy please stop crying!\" Mrs. Bolton pleaded at 1 AM. \" Why can\\'t he just sleep?\" Jack groaned, slumped in the nursery chair that they placed in the corner of Troy\\'s room. When to feed you... \"Okay...he\\'s finally sleeping.\" Mr. Bolton sighed with relief as he and his wife began to tiptoe out of the nursery... Only to be met with a screaming sound. \"No!\" They moaned Everything. \\'Cause you were their little man *smug voice*. (Baby giggles innocently, once again) And also because...y\\'know, you\\'re a baby. Then you hit your child years, when every little thing you do is a huge deal. (Troy falls of his bike) \"Mom! Dad!\" Troy cried \"My tooth came out!\" he said excitedly. Mrs. Bolton ran over to him, \"Troy that is not normal! Your teeth shouldn\\'t fall out because of a bicycle accident- oh my poor angel!\" she gasped and gave him a hug. There was also the perk, that if anything went wrong, you could go inside and watch CARTOONS! \"Why don\\'t we clean you up, then after we check for any more boo-boos, you can watch television all day if you want.\" His mom suggested. \"Yay!\" Troy cheered. Yup, those were the good old days. Then when you get older (especially around your teenage years) you have more put in front of you, (Troy drops his bag) \"Hi Troy! I\\'m heading to a book club meeting in a few minutes. Do your chores please, I left a list on the fridge!\" Lucille called from her room. \"Alright mom!\" The 14 year old groaned, observing the seemingly long list already. Going to the park with Chad, Zeke, and Jason would have to wait. But the child inside of you is still practically carefree. (TV theme song, Troy dancing) \"Pokemon! Gotta catch em all! Yeah~!\" Troy sang at the top of his lungs as he vacuumed his room. Some say that your life truly begins at the magical one-six. There\\'s just something special about the age of 16, that somehow makes it different from all the other birthdays. My name is Troy Bolton and I\\'m a 15 year old student at East High in Albuquerque New Mexico. And on my 16th birthday...I would see that there really was something special about it. The 16th Wish.'][Chapter 3] ['As Troy Alexander Bolton began to stir from his sleep one Sunday morning, his brain didn\\'t take long to process his first thought of the day. Well, his brain didn\\'t take long to process his first three thoughts of the day, to be exact. Thought #1: He wasn\\'t in his bed from home. In fact, he was in his cabin room bed at Camp Divinity. Thought #2: He enjoyed the soft and warm feeling of the sun\\'s rays kissing his face through the open window nearby. Thought #3: His bed felt odd. It was as if someone had placed a weight at the end of it where his legs were. Filled with the new curiosity he had, Troy rolled over and looked at the end of his bed. He was not prepared to see all of his friends sitting there, staring at him, and grinning like nine mischievous cheshire cats. It was because he wasn\\'t prepared, that Troy gave a startled yelp at the sight of them. \"Surprise!\" They all cheered as party poppers sounded, and confetti flew into the air. \"Y-you guys, what are you doing here?!\" He asked, sitting up abruptly and slowly coming down from previous his fight or flight mode. Kelsi blinked from his left side, \"Troy, what do you mean \\'what are we doing here\\'? It\\'s your birthday! We wanted to surprise you!\" She smiled. Troy then noticed the cupcake she held in her hands that was wrapped in a pretty blue liner and topped with a candle that had yet to be lighted. Oh yeah, it was his birthday. \"I chose the star sprinkles on the icing, because you\\'ll always be my star!\" His girlfriend, Gabriella Montez, pointed out with a giggle. \"I-It looks yummy!\" Troy cracked a smile, calming down. \"I\\'d hope so, we got up early this morning to make it for you.\" Chad joked, playfully slugging his right shoulder. \"You say that as if you weren\\'t the one insisting that we should wake up even earlier to make him a complete cake two days ago.\" Taylor McKessie arched a brow at him playfully. \"What can I say McKessie, my best friend deserves the best.\" He replied. \"Well, at least I think so. You guys decided to waste the extra hour on sleep .\" \"Um, yeah, very much needed sleep!\" Sharpay scoffed, stretching a little bit. \"My bed needs a new mattress, it\\'s an absolute nightmare!\" \"Talk to Christian about it.\" Zeke suggested with a sympathetic smile. Christian was their youth group leader, and one of the adults in charge of Camp Divinity. \"Trust me, I will.\" \"Alright then!\" Martha clapped her hands. \"Troy, according to what we learned from previous class parties, you are very uncomfortable with the birthday song. So, to help make this day good, we\\'ve voted on not singing it.\" \"Thank God.\" Troy breathed dramatically, earning a laugh from his chums. \"And now, without further ado...\" She announced like a proud ringmaster as the rest of the group created a drumroll sound, \"Jason, light the candle !\" Jason grinned, walked over to Kelsi with the lighter he held, and lit the candle. \"Make a wish Troy!\" Kelsi smiled. \"Oh wow you guys, this is awesome, thank you!\" He smiled. \"But...I don\\'t know what to wish for! I think I\\'ll pass.\" The gang made sounds of protest. \"You only get one wish each year Troy.\" Gabriella smiled \"Yeah! So why don\\'t you use this one?\" Taylor added. \"Before you lose it.\" Ryan pointed to him. \"Just because you\\'re 16 now doesn\\'t mean you\\'re too old for a birthday wish. Remember that.\" \"Really, guys, I have nothing to wish for.\" Troy said. \"Well...think of something.\" Kelsi gave a gentle smile. \"Maybe you should wish for an easy life.\" Chad suggested after a few seconds of thought. \"We all turn 16 this year, and my mom says that\\'s when teen life really starts to get more challenging. \" The others nodded in agreement. \"You know my mom said the same thing.\" Taylor said, looking at the ceiling in thought. \"So did mine.\" Ryan shrugged. \"I\\'m not sure why it\\'s specifically 16 though.\" \"Hm...\" Troy considered it before his eyes brightened, \"Okay! Well,\" He shrugged and smacked his hands to the bed \"I wish that from all of our 16th years onward, we have a good life!\" he declared before blowing out the candle. Silence. \"Troy.\" Gabriella whispered with wide eyes. \"Yeah, what\\'s up?\" He answered \"You\\'re not supposed to say your wish!\" Taylor said in a breathless high pitched voice. \"Oh, Yeah.\" Troy said. \"Forgot about that rule. Huh.\" \"Everyone knows that when you say your risk out loud, it doesn\\'t come true!\" Ryan said. \"So technically, you wished that our lives were hard from this year onward.\" \"Superstition or not, I don\\'t want to find out if the \\'Rules of the Birthday Candle\\' actually exist. You just put that on all of us .\" Chad said. \"Way to go, Troy.\" Martha smirked. \"Guys, chill. We don\\'t have to listen to some stupid wish rules!\" Troy said, rolling his eyes. \"We\\'ll be fine!\" \"We\\'ll see.\" Sharpay replied before they all heard the sound of a megaphone feedback as it turned on. \"Alright kids! Bring your bags outside, grab some breakfast from the front, and let\\'s head on home!\" Christian called out from the front of the cabins. \"The bus will be here in a few minutes! It was at this moment when Troy\\'s brain supplied him with another thought for the day: He was not ready for Winter Break to end. It wasn\\'t that he hated school, his school was actually pretty decent. He didn\\'t want break to end because he\\'d had so much fun camping with his friends. They loved spending their vacations at Camp Divinity, they\\'d been going since they were in elementary school back when it first opened. Back then, Troy and Chad\\'s fathers lead the youth group with Christian\\'s dad. They were friends in college and Christian\\'s dad, Joseph Miller, had just inherited the place from his father Grant. It had been passed down for generations. The Millers loved camping. \"Okay guys! The bus is all loaded. Remember, we have to be back by 3:30!\" Christian said about thirty minutes later as the bus doors opened for boarding. They all took their to-go breakfasts in paper bags and boarded the vehicle with the other teens as Chris took roll. When the rest of the group boarded (the Wildcats were at the back of the line), Sharpay waited a moment before letting Christian put his clipboard away. \"Chris, I have a question about my bed. Third floor, \"Cabin 9- The Honey Badger Room\", Left single bed?\" Sharpay began to make her case, \"The mattress is very uncomfortable.\" \"I\\'ll tell you a secret, Sharpay.\" He smiled warmly before his voice quieted. \"Mine was too, we\\'re getting them replaced next weekend. It should be fixed by the time you come back.\" \"Thank God.\" Sharpay sighed in relief. \"Okay, that will be all. Thanks Chris!\" She boarded the bus and Chris gave a chuckle before boarding the bus. They all waved goodbye to the camp staff and began their drive home. -Home Again~!- When they arrived back in Albuquerque and the bus parked outside of the church, the kids began to get off and grab their and Taylor were one of the first people off of the bus, only having to wait for a short time to get their bags. As it turned out, a boy of their age by the name of Dylan Black was contributing to the fast pace, assisting people in finding their luggage by having them point it out for him to grab. \"Hey Chad, hey Taylor.\" Dylan smiled (though his brown eyes seemed to brighten at \"Taylor\"). \"Here to get your bags?\" \"And what else would we be doing?\" Taylor smirked, although she was only messing with him. His mother was an old business partner of her father\\'s. They would hang out with each other during business meetings at each other\\'s houses when they were children. \"Yes, I suppose you\\'re right.\" Dylan chuckled. She gave him a smile and a light slug to his arm. \"Thanks for helping unload. We all know it would go a lot slower otherwise.\" \"Of course!\" He said with a nod that made his raven hair swish. \"Can you imagine if we had a repeat of last year?\" He laughed with her and motioned for her lean down to look into the under bus storage.\"Which one will it be?\" He placed a friendly hand on her middle back and Chad\\'s eyes widened slightly. \"Hm...I think I see it in the right corner, behind that blue one with the basketball charm.\" Taylor observed and pointed out. Dylan removed his hand from her and pulled them both out. \"That would be mine, thank you.\" Chad said after Dylan put his luggage out, reminding them of his presence. \"Oh! Cool.\" Dylan said, pulling out Taylor\\'s purple one. \"There you go, Tay.\" She smiled and gave him a small hug which he happily returned. \"Thanks Dyl, you\\'re the best.\" \"I try to be.\" He laughed. Chad rolled his eyes with a sigh, how annoying. \"Hey, didn\\'t you guys used to date?\" He asked suddenly, making himself known once again. \"Um...I wouldn\\'t say, date ?\" Taylor blinked at him, as did Dylan. \"Yeah, no.\" He said. \"No, no, I think I remember that in 8th or 9th grade, you guys were an item.\" Chad replied. \"You walked down the halls linked to each other sometimes?\" \"I mean...yeah we went to dances together and went to each other\\'s houses for dinner and went to the movies every now and then,\" Dylan began. \"So, dating. Date stuff.\" Chad said bluntly. \"Um…\" Dylan scrunched up his face a bit. \"Yeah, I guess you could label that as dating. That was 2-3 years ago, though.\" \"Huh. I would have thought you were planning a reunion, seeing how you guys interact, I mean.\" Chad replied with a face that wasn\\'t exactly friendly, or innocent. He seemed to know whose buttons he was trying to push. \"What?\" Taylor looked at him with her face scrunched into a confused and slightly irritated look. What was he talking about? Perhaps he was jealous. Sure, he took her to an afterparty after his game a few months ago, but she was pretty sure that afterwards they had agreed to go back to their old ways with each being the other\\'s nemesis (only with less hatred this time around). They had agreed that their partnership of trying to split up Troy and Gabriella was temporary and that their attractions to each other were only a result of that. So… \"Why does it matter?\" Taylor asked him with the same look after Chad and Dylan continued the conversation for a moment. Chad stopped and looked at her for a moment, blinking once, twice. \"It doesn\\'t. I\\'m just wonderi-\" He began before they heard a high pitched scream, they quickly rushed to the other side of the bus where they saw Kelsi on the floor in front of the doors, clutching her ankle painfully. Christian rushed over to her. \"Are you alright Kelsi?\" He asked her and she shook her head quickly. \"What happened?!\" He asked the teens who were coming off behind her (including Sharpay and Ryan). \"She missed a step and fell.\" Sharpay said with wide eyes. \"I don\\'t think she was paying attention to be honest…\" \"Yikes Kels…\" Ryan commented with wide eyes as well. \"Are you okay?!\" A tight lipped, eye shut Kelsi shook her head \"My ankle hurts really bad!\" Christain spotted another leader who had just stepped out from the building and waved them over quickly. Together, they both tried to help stand Kelsi up, but it only resulted with her yelping loudly in pain. After believing it to be a sprain, they called the ambulance. Chris called Kelsi\\'s mom to alert her of what had happened and went with her to the hospital. The other leader stayed in his place. After they took Kelsi away everyone stood in slight shock. Quiet murmurs were heard. Among the murmurs, Sharpay said to the group: \"This Day.\" Sharpay began, looking at Troy \"Is so cursed.\" the birthday boy (who had just grabbed his luggage) blinked. \"This life is so cursed.\" Ryan shuddered, everyone stood in silence. \"It was an accident guys, come on.\" Gabriella said with her hand in Troy\\'s. \"Or a birthday wish gone wrong.\" Jason said. \"It\\'s a coincidence .\" Troy smirked. \"Heard of \\'em?\" He playfully hit Jason in the chest with a pillow. \"Brought you your pillow.\" \"Oh, thanks dude.\" Jason replied. \"I hope you\\'re right, Troy.\" Martha said, loading her car. \"Because that, was weird. Come on Jase, I\\'ll take you home.\" Honks were heard. \"My parents are here.\" Troy said. \"My mom is here.\" Gabriella said at the same time. They both laughed and he kissed her cheek. \"See you at school tomorrow Wildcat, happy birthday!\" She smiled, running to her car. \"Bye!\" He chuckled and waved to the rest of his friends. \"See you at school guys!\" \"See you at school!\" They chorused. \"Happy birthday!\" Troy greeted his parents and got into the backseat, where his presents were waiting for him in a stack. He laughed and thanked them before buckling his seatbelt. As they drove off for a fun filled day, Troy thought over what had happened earlier. He knew there was no way his wish caused Kelsi to sprain her ankle. However… He also knew that his wish totally caused Kelsi to sprain her ankle. Hey guys! Hope you enjoyed this chapter! Have any comments? Let me know down below!'][Chapter 4] ['(Troy\\'s voiceover) Here we are, first day back at school! While everyone is preparing for their next classes, let\\'s observe the hallway! Welcome to our social hierarchy! Meet the gang! First off, you have the Wildcats ! The Wildcats are the school\\'s esteemed basketball team! They can also be labeled as \"The Jocks\". They\\'re \"at the top of the food chain\", if you will. They tend to be the most liked (or secretly hated). \"YEAH!\" Chad, Zeke, Jason, and Troy cheered with their team. The Wildcats (as a team, not a school), consists of several people. The team captains include me, Troy Bolton, as captain of the team and my best friend Chad Danforth as the co-captain (he captains the baseball team as well). Several people make up this amazing team! We also have pretty awesome cheerleaders, who could also be considered as a part of \"The Jocks\"/ the Wildcat team. However, let\\'s focus in on our group of friends specifically: Meet the Jocks! For the basketball players you have… Zeke Baylor, age 16! He\\'s the best baker I\\'ve ever met! Also, has a huge crush on Sharpay Evans, a drama club teen... \"Hey Sharpay!\" Zeke greeted his crush as she walked up to his locker. \"Zekey!\" Sharpay chirped, her light brown eyes sparkling with excitement. \"Did you bring the cookies?\" Zeke pulled a cookie tin out of his locker and opened it to reveal bright pink sugar cookies with a magenta \\'S\\' on top. \"Tada!\" He sang. Sharpay squealed and hugged him. \"You\\'re the best!\" (But, we\\'ll get back to her later.) Next you have Jason Cross , age 16! He\\'s not exactly the bright one of the bunch, but really nice and fun to be around! And there\\'s my best friend, Chad Danforth , age 15! He\\'s obsessed with basketball and takes a lot of pride in our team. He seems tough on the outside sometimes, but he has a big heart! \"Hey, Chad? I just found this test from last semester in my locker.\" Jason said to his friend, pulling out the slightly crumpled piece of paper. \"What kind of test is it?\" Chad asked, standing his textbooks straight after putting one in his bag for class. \"Algebra, equations.\" Jason said. \"I don\\'t know why I got so many wrong. I was sure sure I did it correctly.\" Chad turned and held out his hand, \"Let me have a look at it.\" he offered. Jason handed it to him and Chad observed it for a moment. \"Well, Jason, here\\'s your problem! You missed the division part, that threw off the rest of your equation.\" Jason mouthed \"Ooooh…\" silently. \"Here,\" Chad continued, \"Take this one for example. What is 6 divided by 2? You put 12.\" \"Because it is 12!\" Jason exclaimed. \"What?! Jason, no, it\\'s 3! You\\'re thinking of multiplication.\" Chad blinked. Jason looked over the paper once again and thought about it before silently mouthing \"Ooooh…\" once again. \"Sometimes, I worry about you.\" Chad mumbled. \"Yeah, me too. I get nervous during tests.\" Jason admitted. \"You look nice today, by the way.\" Chad smiled at that. \"Thanks Jase.\" Last, you have me, Troy Bolton , age 16! I love basketball and my friends. I\\'m a pretty chill person to be around to be honest, I like when everyone gets along. Oh, and I\\'m dating the love of my life! I can\\'t wait to introduce her. \"Hey guys! Have you seen Gabriella yet?\" Troy walked up to his friends and asked. \"No, not yet.\" Jason and Chad said simultaneously. \"Hey, Danforth!\" They heard and saw a pretty green-eyed redhead walk their way. Meet the Cheer Squad First, you have Amber Wilson , age 15. She\\'s the captain of the squad and the personality of a leader to prove it. We used to call her fireball in elementary school because of her hot temper. She\\'d always be the once to keep us in line, though. \"Where were you all break?!\" She asked Chad, playfully slapping his arm. \"I was at camp!\" Chad snickered, play fighting her back. Amber\\'s co-captain and best friend Natalie Gonzalez , is also 15. The two of them have been friends with us since we were kids. \"Hey guys, how was break?\" Natalie smiled to the rest of the group, her long jet black hair pulled into a ponytail. \"Good!\" They replied. \"Clearly not since you didn\\'t think to hang out with us once !\" Natalie smirked. \"Yeah, what\\'s up with that?!\" Amber joined in and a playful debate ensued. Across the hallway, Taylor narrowed her eyes at the group of friends as she closed her locker. \"The hall is always so peaceful until they get together.\" She commented with an irritated sigh. \"It\\'s been like that since elementary school.\" \"Well, jocks will be jocks.\" Martha smiled. \"And we…\" She waved her finger in a circle, indicating the rest of the group behind her. \"will be brainiacs.\" She grinned. Meet the Brainiacs The brainiacs (or as some say, \"nerds\") are a well sized group. They lead the school through scholastic decathlons, spelling bees, all that jazz. Their leader, who also happens to be the class president, is Taylor Mckessie. She\\'s 15. \"That, we will be.\" Taylor replied proudly grinning back. \"Talking about nerd stuff?\" She heard someone say. That someone was Chad, and her grin immediately changed to a frown because of it. \"Danforth, don\\'t you have anything better to do? Like calling as much attention to yourself as possible? Or worshipping the trophy case? Or heck, observe your muscles?\" Taylor asked. \"Why don\\'t you do that instead?\" \"Aw, I\\'m glad you noticed my muscles McKessie.\" Chad gushed with a sarcastic smirk. \"However, why would I do any that when I could be bothering you instead?\" \"What is my life.\" Taylor hissed quietly, looking at the ceiling. Chad and Taylor...they don\\'t always get along. In fact, when we were in second grade, they swore to enemies and hate each other forever. I don\\'t know why their date didn\\'t work out, not completely. The tale is as old as time though, Chad and Taylor cannot stand each other. \"Chad, if you were my husband I\\'d poison your coffee.\" Taylor said, looking straight ahead at her locker. \"If you were my wife I\\'d drink it!\" Chad scoffed. Taylor flipped around to face Martha again, turning her back on him. Chad just laughed. \"Leave her alone, Chad.\" Jason smirked, wrapping an arm around Martha. \"Morning, beautiful.\" \"Hey, you.\" Martha smiled at her boyfriend. Martha Cox , age 16. She\\'s awesome, and has some killer hip hop routines. When it comes to supporting the merging of statuses, I like to think of Martha as one of the top supporters. She was one of the first to start openly dating someone outside of her status. The first couple to do so would be me and my girlfriend- \"Sorry I\\'m late! Hey guys!\" Gabriella ran up to the group, slightly out of breath. \"Morning!\" They waved. There she is, Gabriella Montez ! Age 15, absolutely beautiful! She\\'s a super smart science girl and the Juliet to my Romeo. She\\'s the love of my life! \"Hey Troy!\" Gabriella sang as she hugged Troy. \"Hey Gabi!\" Troy kissed her cheek. \"Morning guys.\" They heard and turned to see Ryan Evans. Ryan Evans was a part of the drama club teens. Meet the Drama Club Teens Leading the drama teens you have Sharpay Evans and her twin brother/partner in crime, Ryan Evans. \"We have arrived.\" Sharpay flipped her hair to add effect to her sentence. \"Long live the queen.\" Chad muttered under his breath, earning a glare from her. Sharpay Evans has been in every school play since elementary school and she\\'s played the lead role in every one. Who\\'s to blame? She has talent. Sometimes that talent can go to her head. She could also be known as the ice queen of the drama teens. She could be labeled as the ice queen of the school, really. Sometimes she says or does mean things...but she can be nice too. We still consider her one of us no matter what! \"Welcome back one and all.\" Ryan clapped his hands together. \"Let\\'s do this.\" Ryan Evans likes hats. He claims to have a massive collection of them at home and we definitely believe him. It seems as if we\\'ve never seen the same hat twice. He also likes to write music and choreograph dance routines. He\\'s the quieter twin who also possesses the Evans\\' talents of putting on a good show. Being the quieter twin also means being pushed around by the older twin (of 7 minutes), Sharpay. He seems okay for now, but one day he\\'ll get the spotlight. \"Never to fear, the drama teens are here.\" Kelsi smiled, finally meeting up with the group on her new crutches. Last but not least, there\\'s Kelsi Nielsen , age 15. Also a drama teen. She is also soft-spoken likes to write songs, they always ending up speaking directly to the heart. She also tends to get pushed around by Sharpay. She\\'s like her assistant. We all think that she and Ryan should go out, but they seem too shy to flirt with each other for long periods of time. Well, that\\'s everyone! \"Well, that\\'s everyone.\" Zeke said. \"So, how is everyone\\'s m-\" Suddenly, the bell rang. Everyone groaned, knowing it was time for class. They waved goodbye and started off on their short journeys. \"See you at lunch guys.\" Troy laughed. Welcome to East High.'][Chapter 5] ['Good morning everyone! Or I could say good afternoon/evening, it depends on when I get this chapter uploaded… Anyway, I hope you guys are enjoying the remodel! I\\'m going as fast as I can for these first few chapters and I\\'m loving the idea of my schedule! One step at a time is always best. So let\\'s continue with the series\\'s first step, shall we? When Sharpay Evans heard the serene sound of the lunch bell ring, she was just finishing a re-application her favorite strawberry pink lip gloss. Her lips turned up slightly in a triumphant smile as she quickly put her notebook in her bag and prepared to leave. One might ask why she had such an expression of victory at the mere sound of the lunch bell. Well, it wasn\\'t because they were serving New York Deli sandwiches in the cafeteria that day, but rather because the lunch bell held a different meaning for her. \"Ah ah ah, everyone wait just a moment!\" stopped her history class. \"Before you go I want to remind you guys about our upcoming events. I know that everyone is excited for the New Years\\' Dance, but please remember that your greek scholar essay is due that Thursday!\" She sighed internally, noting that they were all too busy packing to pay full attention to her. Even so, she continued speaking. \"I will be accepting them then until I leave my office at 4 PM! Remember class, business before pleasure . Give yourselves enough free time to relax. Have a nice day! Oh, and good luck to everyone who auditioned for our upcoming school play!\" The students bustled out the doorway, eager to get to their sandwiches and friends. Sharpay, however, didn\\'t follow the crowd on their way to the cafeteria. She had to make a quick stop to the bulletin board down the hall first. She had to get past the mass of students in the hall first though... As she began to move her way past her fellow students, Zeke spotted her from the classroom he had come out of and made his way to her side. \"Hey Sharpay!\" Zeke smiled, holding a paper in his hand. \"How was class?\" \"Class was class.\" Sharpay said quickly, still trying to maneuver her way through the hungry high schoolers. \"Cool! I uh, entered the school baking competition! I think I\\'m going to make cupcakes.\" He continued. \"I was thinking up names for my entry, but I\\'m not sure-\" \"That\\'s nice Zeke- I\\'ll see you at lunch!\" She said, pushing past him \"Um…okay? I-I\\'ll see you later!\" He beamed and sighed \"She\\'s so beautiful…\" A girl heard him from across the hall and scrunched up her nose, \"Seriously?\" she gawked at him. He didn\\'t notice and made his way to lunch. When Sharpay passed the music room, Kelsi looked a bit flustered as she hobbled on her crutches as fast as she could to Sharpay. \"Sharpay!\" She called with a wave. \"I was thinking about what you mentioned before break, about the balcony scene song for next month\\'s play? The song is about both parties feeling insecure about seeing each other again. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s a good idea to have the lead- I mean, to have you sing both parts. It would take away from the male lead\\'s character.\" The play didn\\'t have the characters\\' names just yet. \"What are you talking about? It sounds like a great idea if it means I get more parts, silly!\" She beamed, giving Kelsi a playful shove, accidentally sending her sideways. She didn\\'t notice, her eyes saw the bulletin board a few steps away. \"Whoa!\" Kelsi exclaimed, falling to the side towards the wall. Taylor just so happened to see her on her way to lunch and rushed to catch her, slamming into the wall in her place. \"Ow!\" She exclaimed. \"Sorry Taylor!\" Kelsi gasped. Taylor growled in annoyance and tried to push Kelsi up nicely. Chad, Gabriella, and Troy had curiously followed Taylor after her dash. They stood next to her and watched Sharpay as she went up the bulletin board. \"It\\'s fine Kelsi.\" Taylor said \"Sharpay, watch it!\" she called out angrily to Sharpay. Sharpay was no longer listening, because she had reached her destination. Sure enough she found that... Sharpay turned around quickly with excited eyes, her blonde hair swishing with the movement, \"I got the role!\" she squealed. \"I get to play the leading lady \"Yay, you did it, we all knew you would.\" Taylor said, unenthusiastically as she helped Kelsi back up. Sharpay grinned to herself and took out her phone to text Ryan to meet her by the bulletin. The rest of the group went to lunch. \"I don\\'t get how she can be so selfish at times.\" Taylor muttered. \"This is Sharpay we\\'re talking about.\" Chad replied. \"She was basically born with a compact mirror in her hand.\" \"It\\'s probably just bad habit.\" Troy said. \"Probably.\" Gabriella sighed. \"She is our friend regardless, but sometimes she can be a bit much...\" They walked into the cafeteria and started off towards their tables. \"Oh, Danforth!\" Taylor called out to Chad before he went to put his bag down, causing him to turn and look at her. \"Don\\'t forget, we\\'re back to working on the dance tomorrow after school. We should have some stuff coming in tomorrow. I think they\\'re the chargers and cutlery that we ordered.\" \"Oh, great!\" Chad said. \"Okay then. So, tomorrow at 3:30?\" He asked with a point. \"Tomorrow at 3:30. Don\\'t be late!\" She pointed back. \"I would never do such a thing.\" Chad crossed his arms and Taylor gave him a look. \"...again.\" Chad added with a mischievous grin. \"See you then, Chad.\" She rolled her eyes dramatically and walked to her group. Even though Troy and Gabriella had changed the game when it came to East High\\'s status quo, the school hadn\\'t quite caught on just yet. Because of this, the group ended up sitting with their normal groups and the school\\'s golden couple usually ended up having lunch on a rooftop bench. It wasn\\'t perfect, but at least they got to spend lunch together without their friend groups being nasty to each other. \"I\\'m going to be honest.\" Gabriella said, after she and Troy had recovered from laughing at a joke he\\'d made. \"I love spending this time with you. I love any time I spend with you.\" \"I love spending time with you too.\" Troy smiled. \"Thanks Wildcat.\" Gabriella smiled back fondly. \"I wish everyone felt the same way…\" \"Old habits die hard. It\\'s gonna take a while for them to change.\" Troy commented, taking a bite of his sandwich. \"I know...but it would be so nice if everyone would just accept one another.\" She sighed, taking a sip of her chocolate milk. It was quiet for a moment before Gabriella asked him, \"Would you ever go back to the way things were, with your friends?\" Troy smirked at that before looking back at his girlfriend, \"No way. Then I wouldn\\'t have you.\" He poked her side playfully. She giggled happily in response and placed her head on his shoulder. \"I love you, Troy.\" \"I love you too, Gabi.\" Suddenly, their phones rang. They had just received a text from Zeke. They both looked off of Troy\\'s phone. Zeke: Anyone up for milkshakes? Taylor and I are paying. Back to school treat! Zeke, Taylor, Kelsi, and Jason all worked at a diner inside of their neighborhood mall by the name of Albuquerque\\'s Best. It was actually pretty good food spot! They\\'d started the year before. Zeke was an excellent cook, Kelsi and Taylor made good waitresses (But Kels couldn\\'t do work at the time obviously) , and Jason...Jason was a decent waiter as well. \"Milkshakes?\" Troy asked Gabriella. \"Milkshakes.\" She nodded with a grin. \"Now let\\'s organize carpool.\" -Diner Day- \"I wanna ride with Zeke!\" Kelsi quickly said as they all stood in the parking lot after school. \"You\\'re riding with me!\" Sharpay declared. Kelsi grumbled and trudged to Shar\\'s pink car. \"Okay then, open air driving with my best friend it is.\" She groaned. \"I\\'m riding with Troy and Jason in Martha\\'s car...her playlist is too good to miss so...\" Gabriella slowly said. \"Gee thanks, I get to third wheel.\" Taylor grumbled. \"Chad can go with you in Shar\\'s car?\" She said \"There\\'s two more seats-\" \"We\\'d rather not.\" Chad said. \"Well...Troy and I aren\\'t sharing.\" Gabriella gave a smirk. They gagged. \"So unless you want to walk to the diner...then-\" Sharpay\\'s music was blasting down the highway. Or was it her voice? The world would never know. \"TOUCH ME!\" she belted as the passionate song from Cats played. \"IT\\'S SO EASY TO LEAVE ME! ALL ALONE WITH MY MEMORY!\" Kelsi sat in the middle, pulling her hat a little lower in an attempt to cover her face from passing and Taylor were sitting with their arms crossed, facing different directions. Ryan looked annoyed beyond belief. \"Sharpay, can we listen to some pop music or something? And for Pete\\'s sake could we turn it down?\" The song paused and the back seaters groaned. \"Ryan, this is my car.\" Sharpay said dramatically as if she had been inconvenienced. \"Well, you could at least make it more bearable to ride in!\" He argued. \"Amen to that.\" Kelsi grumbled. \"Excuse me Kelsi, would you like to walk?\" she batted her eyes in her rearview mirror. \"Sharpay!\" Taylor\\'s eyes widened. Something told her they were coming to that on/off stage. \"You know it\\'d take even longer for her in her current state!\" \"My ankle is a bit squished...\" she whimpered \"Kelsi, do you ever stop whining?!\" Sharpay exclaimed \"Hey! Watch it!\" Ryan and Chad exclaimed. \"This is my car, you chose to ride in it.\" The three in the back seat opened their mouths to protest, but soon decided against it. Sharpay kept talking, \"I was kind enough to bring you to the diner/work.\" She had a small point? \"I\\'m blasting my voice and speakers like I always do , end of story.\" She switched \\'Cats\\' back on. Everyone groaned and sat in silence until they got off the freeway and parked in the mall\\'s parking lot. \"We\\'re here!\" Taylor cheered. \"Milkshake time! \"Yay!\" Everyone cheered. They hopped out the car. Ryan retrieved Kelsi\\'s crutches from the trunk, handing them to her. She smiled and hobbled off. \"Let\\'s go Shar.\" Ryan said. She sighed and followed them in. One escalator and a few steps later, they entered the restaurant with their friends. \"Hey Brick.\" The young employees greeted their boss. The man looked like a slightly younger version of Gordon Ramsay, except with dark brown hair. Like the famous chef, Brick had an accent as well. He also wasn\\'t always the nicest boss. Of course he had his good days, but most days consisted of him being moody and frustrated for unknown reasons. Brick threw up his hands in dramatic frustration before letting his hands stop midway. \"You\\'re late!\" He exclaimed. \"Yes by...\" Taylor looked at her watch. \"Two minutes now.\" Brick looked at her. \" . What time are you to be here?\" \"3:40, Brick.\" Taylor answered dully. \"What time is it now?\" \"3:42.\" \"Mhm.\" He nodded, standing next to her. \"You\\'re late.\" They all sighed and apologized. Brick gently jerked his head to the office and kitchens. \"Get dressed.\" They all went to grab their uniforms from their lockers, except Kelsi, who was stopped by Brick. \"What the bloody hell happened to you?\" His eyes widened. \"I fell...\" She responded. He pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Perfect.\" \"I-I\\'m sorry...Brick?\" Kelsi tensed. He turned his exhausted face to the shorter girl in the bunch. \"We needed to update the playlists anyway. Think you can do it?\" She nodded twice. \"Go on then. I\\'ll have to think of something else for you to do until you feel better. It\\'ll most likely be kitchen work.\" He said the last part more to himself than to her. She nodded again and went. The rest of the gang greeted him before taking sitting down at an open booth near the window. \"Okay, menus.\" Brick placed them down on the table. \"As a working adult I suggest you, Mr. Bolton take it to-go. If I remember correctly you have to be at Best Buy in...\" he checked his watch. \"Twenty minutes.\" His eyes widened. He didn\\'t remember -in all the times that he\\'d come there- ever telling him- \"Teens can be loud. Adults memory can be sharp.\" He whispered, walking off. Everyone smirked at Troy\\'s expression. \"You heard him wildcat.\" Gabi smiled. \"Hurry up. Here, I\\'ll grab one too and we can leave together. I have to help mom at the shop.\" Her mother ran a local pet store with her Uncle for the time being and Gabi could thank that for keeping her grounded for now. Ms. Montez\\'s original company had hit a rough patch, laying several workers off, including her. It was sad yes, but her mom found a way again, she always did. Troy smiled at her as they opened their menus. Taylor gracefully slid up to the table wearing her uniform, cute as ever. \"Hi! Welcome to Alb- oh please you already know-\" Taylor tried to skip it with a laugh. \"Finish it!\" Brick yelled with a slight tune from across the room. Taylor\\'s eyes widened. She sighed before perking up again, falsely. \"\"Hi! Welcome to Albuquerque\\'s Best, I\\'m Taylor and I\\'ll be your server today! Are you ready to order?\" The gang snickered, which made her give a look of annoyance. \"Stop it. Now are you ready?\" \"One chocolate milkshake please.\" Martha raised a hand \"Strawberry for me please.\" Ryan said as Taylor scribbled on a notepad. \"Vanilla.\" Sharpay said in a slightly demanding tone. Taylor glared. \"Of course, your highness.\" She mumbled. \"Two oreo!\" Troy and Gabriella ordered in sync, laughing. \"As always.\" Taylor smiled, looking to Chad. \"And you?\" Chad blinked, staring at the girl that he had called his nemesis for as long as he could remember. She was so graceful and sassy...and he was being honest? She was also kind of cute. Seeing her working made him remember why he asked her to the after party last semester in the first place. Her brain was incredible. She received straight A\\'s in all of her classes, was the Class President, and she was an excellent schemer. The way they\\'d worked side by side to break up Troy and Gabriella for the sake of the status quo and their crews, really gave him a chance to truly get to know her. Those few nights of messaging and planning, late night plan changes… \"Even seeing her in her Mickey Mouse pajamas that one time...\" He thought with an inner laugh. It made them a little closer. Their plan had failed, but they came together for the new less evil one in the end. Their best friends were happy and East High won their course as anyone could see... \"Danforth.\" Taylor snapped him out of his thoughts with a pointed look. Their victory high hadn\\'t lasted. \"I\\'ll have a mint chocolate please.\" He said. \"Fine. That\\'s all?\" They nodded. \"Alright then! Be right back. Troy? Get to work. You forgot to add \\'to go\\'.\" She smirked and the group laughed at him teasingly. \"I can remember that myself thank you!\" He called out. \"Clearly not!\" Taylor sang back, already out of sight. Gabriella looked over to Sharpay, her usual smile fading a little. \"Sharpay, don\\'t you think you were just a little too demanding with Taylor?\" \"She\\'s an employee is she not?\" She replied, fiddling with her phone. \"Well, yeah but...\" Gabriella tried to word it properly. \"She\\'s not y\\'know...your employee.\" \"Okay, maybe she\\'s not. I thought my tone was perfectly fine.\" Sharpay said. \"It\\'s just that...she\\'s your friend too. You have a tendency to be...rude...to people.\" Gabi said softly. Sharpay stopped. \"What?\" \"You can just be...rude sometimes.\" Gabriella repeated \"Especially to your friends.\" \"Gabi, thanks but I don\\'t-\" Ryan began. \"It\\'s true! She\\'s not a bad person she\\'s just kind of mean sometimes!\" She protested, slowly leaning back into the booth, whispering quietly. \"Sometimes...most of the time...all the time.\" \"Hey!\" Sharpay exclaimed \"I\\'m nice!\" she pointed to herself. \"I can be nice!\" she nearly growled. \"Then why are you saying it with almost subtle rage?\" Martha said softly. Chad smirked. Sharpay stood up and quickly walked outside. Ryan sighed and looked to the booth. \"She left her bag...so she\\'s coming back.\" Taylor walked up with the drinks. Fast as ever. Troy sighed. \"Maybe we should go...tell her we apologize?\" \"You were leaving anyway.\" Ryan pointed out with a look. \"Right. Well...um...sorry? Good luck? I dunno just, I hope she\\'s okay.\" Troy said, Gabi nodded gently. He took the drinks from Taylor, thanked her and said goodbye before leaving with Gabi. Taylor blinked. \"Where\\'s Sharpay?\" \"Ice Queen had to step out.\" Chad said before explaining what was said. \"Shouldn\\'t someone go get her?\" She looked to the girl\\'s brother. \"Do you really think I want to calm the storm? No thanks.\" He sipped his milkshake. Taylor blew her bangs from her face. \"She left her bag so-\" \"She\\'s coming back.\" Martha, Ryan, and Chad said in unison. \"Yeah...\" She said softly. \"Well, Table 5\\'s burgers are ready so...I\\'ll see you in a bit.\" \"Um...Tay?\" Martha said. \"You get off in another hour right?\" \"Yes.\" She replied \"I can\\'t drive you home...my sisters are home for the week starting today, we have to go pick them up from the airport.\" Martha said sympathetically. \"I\\'m so sorry girl.\" Taylor sighed with a weak smile. \"It\\'s fine, I\\'ll just try and catch the next bus.\" \"Alone?\" Ryan questioned. \"Sharpay most likely doesn\\'t want to talk to anyone right now.\" \"Yeah. Plus, she has to bring Kelsi home. I heard her say this morning she had a song to show her.\" \"True. But...alone? On the bus?\" \"We\\'ve all done it so many times before!\" \"I don\\'t think so.\" \"Ryan!\" Taylor exclaimed. \"I\\'ll be fine!\" \"I\\'ll go with her. I don\\'t have a ride now either.\" Chad mumbled \"Perfect!\" Ryan said before Taylor could protest. \"Be safe! Glad we worked this out.\" Ryan sipped his milkshake again. Taylor groaned and swiftly walked off to serve Table Five. They all watched as she approached the counter with her tray. They saw Zeke talking to her. \"She doesn\\'t look too pleased.\" Martha whispered to Ryan. \"Neither does he. It\\'s normal.\" He whispered back. \" But~ way to do a good deed Chad!\" He looked over with narrowed eyes. \"Whether she was going or not I\\'d still be on the bus.\" \"Shut up and let me believe you\\'re that nice.\" \"Zeke!\" They heard Taylor call out. Their heads flipped around to see Zeke walking out of the kitchen view. \"Pierre, Brick said you could cover for me.\" He said to the other cook,. \"Um...okay.\" \"Zeke!\" Taylor called out again, following him. The kitchen doors flung open. Zeke started taking off his apron, flinging it onto the hook and heading for the doors, Taylor trying to keep up. \"Zeke where are you going?!\" Tay asked. Zeke turned to look at his friend. \"To look for Sharpay.\" \"She\\'s probably fine Zeke...\" \"Are you talking about her physical, or emotional being? Because storming out of a restaurant after being singled out, is not fine. She was hurt. Someone has to find her.\" He said softly. \"Okay...\" She nodded. \"Hope you find her...\" \"Thanks.\" Zeke said before motioning to Martha. \"I should be back in time to leave with you and Jason.\" \"Alright.\" She nodded. He left and Taylor looked after him before going back to work. Thanks for reading! Next chapter, we\\'re going for the first song of the series. Sorry for not posting the soundtrack, bear with me lol. So next we have, Jessie J\\'s Masterpiece (I\\'m not changing it from the original because I really want to move on lol) and afterwards everyone goes home which will launch us to look into the family backgrounds so we all know what we\\'re dealing with. Happy reading!'][Chapter 6] ['OLD NOTE: Sudden burst of realization. 16andUp as a whole consists of 10 characters. The main characters would be 7. I need to put in the musical scene AND type out what each home looks like. There is NO WAY I can squish all of that into one chapter and still have your full attention. So we resort to blocking and adding a chapter! Next one: Martha, Jason, Zeke, Kelsi, The twins Next Chapter After that: Troy, Gabi, Chad, Taylor Got it? Supporting characters first, (save for drama squad), main characters next! Bring it on! Sharpay quickly walked through the mall, looking for a place away from those she called her friends. She kept walking, breathing heavy. She didn\\'t want to cry, at least not in front of anyone, and she realized that there obviously wasn\\'t a good place to be alone at the mall. However, there had a fountain behind the mall with sculptures and a nice field. Sharpay looked to the other side of the mall, leading downstairs and took a deep breath. Gabriella\\'s words rang in her head. \"It\\'s true! She\\'s not a bad person she\\'s just kind of mean sometimes!\" She protested, slowly leaning back into the booth, whispering quietly. \"Sometimes...most of the time...all the time.\" \"Hey!\" Sharpay exclaimed \"I\\'m nice!\" she pointed to herself. \"I can be nice!\" she nearly growled. \"Then why are you saying it with almost subtle rage?\" Martha said softly. Chad smirked. Sharpay blew a lock of hair from her face. What about those times with Zeke? What about the end of the basketball game? \"We\\'re all in this together\"? Yeah right. She groaned in annoyance. So what if she wasn\\'t nice? At least she was trying. But no one saw that, now did they? (Masterpiece) \"\\'So much pressure, why so loud?\\'\" Sharpay sang, imitating the lot she called her friends. \"If you don\\'t like my sound, you can turn it down. I gotta road...And I walk it alone...\" She narrowed her eyes, boarding the escalator going down. \"Uphill battle, I look good when I climb.I\\'m ferocious- precocious- I get braggadocios I\\'m not gonna stop...I like the view from the top…\" Sharpay shrugged, thinking of times in her life when she wasn\\'t exactly perfect. It was the school play, 8th grade. Cinderella to be exact. Sharpay wanted the part of Cinderella- of course- it was the top role. Duh. However, she was going to have to go against a girl named Olive. She wasn\\'t even blonde. How she got the part, Sharpay would never understand. She\\'d even gone as far to memorize all of Cinderella\\'s lines! She told everyone she would be Cinderella. She thought the part was as good as hers. Apparently not. She was cast as a wicked stepsister instead. So...Sharpay may have gone overboard by getting some of her other friends to help talk about how bad Olive\\'s acting was in front of her and pretend not to notice. Back then, Olive was sensitive. She fled the cafeteria in tears that day. Sharpay got the part, and Olive hated her for it. Sharpay glanced down the escalator and saw her. Olive was even more gorgeous now, but she became tougher since that day. She gave up acting completely, and became a jock (soccer team).She was one of those people who didn\\'t believe in statuses mixing. \"Probably because she doesn\\'t want the preps/drama teens interacting with the jocks. Or \\'me\\' interacting with the jocks really.\" Sharpay thought. Olive met eyes with her before turning to her friends and whispering, they soon all laughed and tried to make discreet glances. They were not discreet. Sharpay\\'s eyes narrowed. \"You talk that blah blah that la la, that rah rah sh-and I\\'m so done, I\\'m so over it!\" She sang as she watched the girl. She couldn\\'t help it. Her attention was now focused. Olive batted her eyelashes and flipped her dark hair. Her mouth movements clearly looked like she was mocking someone. Sharpay\\'s blood boiled as the crowded escalator ride began to come to it\\'s end. \"Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I hit and miss. But I\\'m okay, I\\'m cool with it.\" Sharpay passed them like she didn\\'t even see. She heard Olive\\'s snort of disbelief though. She stopped in front of the kiddie zone, watching them play happily. They didn\\'t have status quos yet. They didn\\'t even have much homework. One kid made her smile though. She was a bubbly, dirty blonde with a pink tutu. Yet, she hung out alone. How did Sharpay notice her? She fell flat on her face in front of them all. \"Oh Emma!\" An employee cooed, picking her up and soothing her. Sharpay averted her eyes to make it a little better for Emma at least. Her eyes caught sight of coloring pages on the door. They had a lot of...messy drawings. Sharpay smiled, relating to the kids in another way. \"I still fall on my face sometimes and I- can\\'t color inside the lines \\'cause, I\\'m perfectly incomplete, I\\'m still working on my masterpiece and I-\" Her eyes widened as she saw a drawing of a log cabin by a lake. It looked as if it were drawn by an adult, and then she saw a name in kid writing. Emma Hunt. Emma\\'s drawing. It was...incredible. She couldn\\'t even draw like that. Sharpay smiled. Those kids saw a clumsy nobody, but she was clearly much more. Just like Sharpay. Besides y\\'know...the nobody part. She was an actress. One day, her name would be on billboards.\"I wanna hang with the greats gotta- way to go, but it\\'s worth the wait, no.\" She turned back to Olive and her crew. \"You haven\\'t seen the best of me. I\\'m still working on my masterpiece and I-\" (Oh oh, oh ah) \"What the heck was that look?\" Ariana, one of the soccer girls, blinked. \"Who cares. She was always off in the first place.\" Olive grumbled, watching Sharpay go outside. \"Why would she change now?\" (Oh oh, oh ah) Sharpay looked past the parking lot to see Gabi and Troy waiting for the bus, hand in hand. She narrowed her eyes, Gabi\\'s words in her head. \"Those who mind, don\\'t matter. Those who matter, don\\'t mind. If you don\\'t catch what I\\'m throwing then I\\'ll leave you behind- gone in a flash...And I ain\\'t living like that...\" Sharpay sang, walking on, heading to the mall fountain. If they were really her friends, why did they treat her differently? \"They talk that Blah blah that la la,\" \"I\\'m actually surprised Ice Queen came.\" Gabi muttered as she helped Martha set up a tent in her living room for a sleepover. \"Someone guard me. Who knows what she\\'s planning.\" \"It could be nothing.\" Kelsi sang. \"Kels, you don\\'t hit on your friend\\'s boyfriend and act like you hate her, then show up to her house for a sleepover.\" Taylor pointed out, putting her hair in a bun. \"Yeah...that\\'s true.\" Kelsi sighed. \"Maybe someone should guard her.\" Gabi laughed. \"TOLD YOU!\" The girls burst into laughter, coming up with devious things Sharpay might do. The worst idea was that she could cut Gabi\\'s hair while she was asleep to perform voodoo or something. \"That rah rah-\" \"Sh!\" Martha hissed as Sharpay entered the room, and everyone was silent. \"Go with the punches, and take the hits. Sometimes I mess up, I eff up, I swing and miss.\" They acted like nothing happened that night, no matter how many times Sharpay asked. What they didn\\'t know is that she was behind the wall the entire time. Sharpay exhaled, sitting on the edge of the fountain. \"But it\\'s okay, I\\'m cool with it.\" No she wasn\\'t. \"I still fall on my face sometimes and I can\\'t color inside the lines \\'cause, I\\'m perfectly incomplete. I\\'m still working on my masterpiece and I-I wanna hang with the greats gotta way to go, but it\\'s worth the wait, no-\" Gabriella sighed to herself as she stood at the bus stop with Troy. Sharpay could be sensitive, but she\\'d never stormed out at something so...small? Or was it small to her? Maybe she had feelings about it before and Gabi was her breaking point! She wanted to bury her head in her arms at the very thought! Shame! Shame on her! Gabriella though about the times when Sharpay was nice to her…. They were at this clothing store, Delores one day. Gabriella saw the prettiest purple dress. It was short and somewhat casual. Sharpay had caught where she was looking and smiled. \"Why don\\'t you try it on Gabi? It might look great.\" \"Yeah...but the pet shop has been closed lately due to my Uncle\\'s broken leg. I don\\'t know why mom couldn\\'t handle it but, currently that means I don\\'t have the money for it. If I try it on, I just know my mood will be wrecked if I like it...\" Gabriella sighed Sharpay looked at her with sympathy. \"I wanted to see you in it too, but I understand.\" she sighed. Suddenly she lifted her head. An idea. \"Unless...\" \"Unless?\" Gabi asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Okay, this may sound really dumb, but what if we tried on clothes just for fun? Like playing dress up.\" Gabi smiled with bright eyes. \"It isn\\'t the smartest concept for our hearts and wallets, but I like the way you think! Setting my mind to \\'just dress up\\'... I\\'m up for it if you are!\" Gabriella giggled. \"Good!\" Sharpay smiled, picking a dress of her own. You haven\\'t seen the best of me They were in that dressing room, talking and laughing while making up play situations for half an hour at least. \"Ready?\" Sharpay asked with a gentle smile, holding up the purple dress. Gabriella inhaled before nodding. She slipped into it. \"Well?\" She asked nervously, facing Sharpay whose eyes were wide. Sharpay gently turned her around to the mirror. Gabriella gasped. It looked beautiful... \"It fits.\" Sharpay said softly. Gabriella observed it from all angles, taking her time. \"Yeah...\" she said after a moment. \"It doesn\\'t fit my price range right now though.\" she sighed. \"Thanks for trying to cheer me up Shar...\" Sharpay nodded, fully dressed. \"I\\'m gonna put these back.\" She said, picking the remaining clothes up. \"See you in a bit?\" Gabi nodded. I\\'m still working on my masterpiece and I-\" When Gabriella walked out with the dress (she had to admit she was being a little slow), the last thing she expected to see was Sharpay smiling with her debit card attached to a receipt. \"What is it?\" Gabriella asked quietly, confused. \"Gabi, that dress looks perfect on you. I just had to buy it.\" She smiled. Gabi\\'s jaw dropped. Sharpay suddenly looked nervous. \"I\\'m sorry, it\\'s not that I didn\\'t think you could buy it for yourself before it went out or something...i-it was just so fabulo-OH!\" Gabriella almost knocked her over in a hug. \"Thank you!\" She said. \"Oh Shar, this has to be the nicest thing you\\'ve ever done for me!\" Sharpay\\'s smile dropped and formed into a confused pout. \"Nnooo...I don\\'t think so.\" \"Hm, yeah. Definitely.\" Gabi smiled, eyes closed in happiness. \"No...\" \"Yeah.\" Gabi poked Sharpay\\'s nose before skipping out the store. Sharpay sighed and chuckled. (Oh oh, oh ah) She felt awful but she wasn\\'t gonna show it. Troy would worry. Troy and Gabriella stood quietly at the bus stop, hand in hand. ... \"You feel bad don\\'t you?\" Troy asked after a moment. He didn\\'t need to look at her to be able to tell. Gabriella nodded quietly. \"I didn\\'t mean to make Sharpay run away...I was-\" \"You were just trying to be honest but you forgot how to word it? Or something?\" Troy finished Gabriella nodded again. \"But- I don\\'t get it. How else could I have worded it?\" Troy blinked. \"The only flaw I saw was the muttering at the end, other than that...I don\\'t know.\" \"Yeah...\" Gabi sighed. \"I\\'ll call her later and apologize.\" (Oh oh, oh ah) \"Oh not today. Whenever she\\'s upset like this she doesn\\'t talk much.\" A honk was heard. Troy looked in it\\'s direction. \"Now come on beautiful, the bus is here.\" Gabriella smiled as the boarded the bus. Sharpay turned to look at her reflection in the water. What were other people seeing that she couldn\\'t? \"I still fall on my face sometimes and I-can\\'t color inside the lines \\'cause-\" That\\'s when she realized what she was saying. \"I\\'m perfectly incomplete. I\\'m still working on my masterpiece. Masterpiece, masterpiece...\" I still fall on my face sometimes and I Can\\'t color inside the lines \\'cause I\\'m perfectly incomplete I\\'m still working on my masterpiece and I Zeke walked around downstairs, asking people if they\\'d seen a blonde girl dressed in pink pants. Every answer was no. Then he saw a fellow jock. Different sports, but same status. \"Olive!\" He called. She turned around. \"Zeke!\" Olive smiled, fist bumping and hugging him. \"What\\'s up?\" \"You know Sharpay? The drama club le-\" He began. Olive scoffed. \"Oh. You mean ice queen? Yeah, what is it?\" Zeke raised a brow. \"Um...look, she ran off from the group and I need to know if you\\'ve seen her...please.\" Olive blinked her dark eyes at him. \"Oh Zeke. Please don\\'t tell me you still have a crush on dramacakes.\" Zeke was starting to lose his patience. Every second Sharpay could move around, making it harder to find her. \"So what if I do? Right now, I\\'m not looking for her or worried about her because I like her. I\\'m doing that because I\\'m her friend.\" Olive blinked. Her expression got a little darker. \"You wanna know where she is?\" she asked, knowing the answer. \"She went outside. Before you go, about being her friend? I wanted to be her friend once. But she showed me she wasn\\'t capable of being a friend to people who weren\\'t like her. So don\\'t blame me in the long run if you get burned.\" Olive\\'s voice shook. She turned on her heel. \"Later Zeke.\" Zeke sadly looked after her before shaking his head. \"Hey Olive!\" \" I wanna hang with the greats gotta Way to go, but it\\'s worth the wait, no You haven\\'t seen the best of me I\\'m still working on my masterpiece and I Olive turned around. \"Yeah?\" \"One day, who knows.\" He smiled. \"She might surprise you.\" Olive sighed, rolling her eyes and walking away. \"I seriously doubt it Zeke.\" (Oh oh, oh ah) Zeke looked after her once more before quickly going to the doors that led to the fountain area. (Oh oh, oh ah) Sharpay looked at her reflection one more time before looking into the sky, it seemed a little clearer now. (still, workin\\' on, still workin\\' on) \"I\\'m still workin\\' on my masterpiece...\" Sharpay finished, exhaling. \"SHARPAY!\" She heard someone call, quickly looking up. That was that my dudes, 2 more chapters and we\\'re all caught up!'][Chapter 7] ['(Important reoccurring) Cast break! You\\'ll need to know for this home seq.

He exhaled, panting slightly. \"Why...did you run?\" She crossed her arms. \"Well you came after me, I figure you should know.\" She muttered. Zeke looked at her. \"Sharpay...\" she slumped. \"Shar, you know Gabriella didn\\'t mean any of that.\" \"Oh but she did!\" she flipped to face him and snapped. \"She meant every word! So does everyone else!\" \"Everyone else?\" he slowly began to back up as she walked forward. The rage and hurt in her eyes were very clear. \"You don\\'t think I used to hear your jokes? The entire basketball team- especially Chad! Ice queen, shopping for mirrors- I still don\\'t understand that!\" she exclaimed, her voice beginning to crack and move into a sob. \"What does that even mean?\" Zeke looked in awe. He felt awful that they had caused her such pain in the past (and present). He hated to see her cry like this because of it... \"I can\\'t help who I am!\" Sharpay cried. \"Not the way you\\'d like me to. One day, that piece of your personality comes in. If it\\'s bad, you don\\'t know how to stop it! It\\'s a part of you.\" She raised a finger, still trying to keep a hard exterior, but failing. \"And I have tried, so hard to keep the peace with all of you. I\\'m still trying! I\\'m trying to be the-the good friend, the one you come and cry to when you have a bad day, the one you actually want to be around!\" Sharpay exclaimed. \"I want to leave all those bad times behind, but some parts I can\\'t change. Not yet anyway...\" Zeke nodded, looking down. \"I\\'ve forgiven all of you...for the most part.\" Sharpay continued as she gave a small, one-shouldered shrug. \"But deep down, I know that no one has forgiven me completely. I don\\'t think you guys ever will...\" Silence. Sharpay let out a shaky breath. She gently turned to face the fountain, beginning to walk to it. ... \"I\\'ve forgiven you?\" She heard Zeke\\'s quiet voice say. Sharpay froze, tensing up and getting ready to cry again. She was soon hugged from behind by him, his head softly resting on top of hers. \"I see you trying Shar, I can tell you want to be nice...you\\'ve become so used to being excluded, you\\'ve forgotten how to truly let go and hang around us. You\\'ve also forgotten how it feels to be truly accepted.\" Sharpay nodded quickly, whimpering a little. \"Well, you\\'re accepted by me. If anyone leaves you behind, you\\'ll always have a friend in me.\" ... \"So….does that mean that you\\'ll ditch the rest of the gang?\" her tiny voice asked. Zeke laughed and replied, \"Shar...that\\'s not exactly how it works.\" She frowned. \"Well how does it work then?\" she grumbled. Zeke sighed with a smile, he had all the patience in the world with this girl. \"It works by me being there for you during the good and bad times, no matter what anyone says.\" \"You don\\'t mean that Zeke.\" Sharpay sighed. \"I\\'m not as pleasant as you might think.\" \"Oh, I don\\'t think that all the time. But that doesn\\'t stop me from wanting to be your friend. Friends don\\'t like each other all the time.\" She nodded gently. \"That doesn\\'t mean you have to be alone.\" Sharpay turned around and hugged him back. \"Zeke...thank you.\" He smiled and accepted the surprise hug. \"Of course.\" She broke the hug, wiping her eyes and sniffling. Zeke still smiled, looking at the setting sun. \"Hey, everyone\\'s starting to head out. Ready to go?\" He offered a hand. She looked at it in disbelief before softening. She reached out, hesitated for a second, and took it. \"Yeah...let\\'s go home.\" XxxxxxxxX Ryan looked up from the table to see his twin coming in, alive and well (not that he\\'d worried about that in the first place. She was fine). He exhaled and picked up her purse as she approached. \"Hey, you okay?\" Ryan asked gently as Sharpay took her belongings from him with a quiet nod. \"I don\\'t think she\\'s ready to talk yet, but I think she\\'s gonna be okay,\" Zeke said. \"Thanks, Zeke.\" Ryan nodded his gratitude. Kelsi came into the room, back on her...foot. Ryan took her backpack, earning a smile and gentle \\'thank you.\\'. \"Mhm. Let\\'s go, later guys!\" he waved. The drama club teens left the scene. Martha stood, grabbing her bag. \"I\\'m ready to head out Chad, try not to kill our leader on the way home?\" She joked before moving a serious look to Taylor, who was cleaning up a counter. \"That girl\\'s gonna do something great one day.\" Chad blinked. \"Right. Don\\'t worry Martha, she\\'ll be fine. If she doesn\\'t kill me first.\" Martha smirked. \"Watch your back.\" She whispered before giving him a playful slug and walking towards the door. \"Go home.\" He scowled. \"That\\'s where I\\'m going!\" She called with a grin. She motioned to Jason, who was coming out the employee room. \"Babe, let\\'s go.\" \"Okay, I\\'m coming.\" He walked over, swinging his bag over his shoulder. \"Later Chad!\" He waved. Zeke joined him. Chad waved to them all. \"Be safe.\" \"Thanks!\" The restaurant doors closed. Taylor came to the table, in the process of setting her low ponytail free. When she finished she blinked. \"Aw! They left already?\" \"They said bye?\" Chad offered. \"No they didn\\'t.\" Taylor said with a knowing smirk. Chad couldn\\'t help but smirk as well. Taylor sighed. \"So, ready to go home?\" He nodded. \"Taylor protector at your service.\" Taylor rolled her eyes slightly. \"I don\\'t need anyone to protect me Chad, and Ryan said you\\'re here so we can protect each other.\" \"Whatever you say McKessie.\" He smirked. She sighed. \"Let\\'s just go already.\" She groaned as they approached the door. He held it open, making a hand motion to her. She looked at him with narrowed eyes before going through silently. \"Wow~ you\\'re so rude!\" He called. \"Thank you Chad~!\" She sang like a student greeting a teacher. \"All I ask for!\" XxxxxxxxX Martha brought her car to a stop in front of Zeke\\'s house. \"Later muffin man!\" she smiled, returning the fist bump he offered her. \"Later Mar- \"He saw his best friend in the front seat. \"You getting out man?\" Jason turned around, shaking his head with an \\'isn\\'t an obvious voice\\' \"This isn\\'t my house!\" \"You live like, a neighborhood or two away!\" Zeke pointed out. \"That\\'s too far! It\\'s evening, man!\" \"It\\'s walking distance! We can walk and talk!\" Jason\\'s eyes widened. \"We do that stuff during the day! You ever heard that saying \\'the freaks come out at night\\'? Not for me they don\\'t. I am not the one.\" \"Dude the minute I get in my mom\\'s gonna ask me to make dinner! I just spent hours making food, I\\'d rather wait until she does it herself this time!\" Zeke groaned. Jason quietly faced forward with crossed arms. \"I don\\'t want to.\" Zeke blinked before looking back and forth at the remaining passengers. \"Aaaah! I see.\" \"What?!\" Jason said \"I see what you\\'re doing! You two want to hang out without the third wheel! I get it!\" Zeke said, in a half joking, half serious voice. \"Zeke!\" Martha laughed \"Okay! I got it!\" He teased, opening the door. The couple still in the car laughed. \"Zeke come on!\" Jason pleaded with his best friend, laughing at his mock anger. The door closed. \"Zeke!\" \"No!\" He made dramatic stomps to the door. \"Come on man!\" Jason smiled. \"Love you Zeke!\" Martha giggled. \"Humph!\" Zeke said before smiling at them. \"Love you guys too. Now Good night ! Ya nasty jerks.\" He added with a sly grin. \"Night Zeke!\" They laughed as the door closed. Zeke chuckled to himself as he locked the door. He opened the coat closet, flipping on the light. He then picked a hanger to put his jacket on. He looked down to begin the procedure. That\\'s when he saw- \"AGH!\" Zeke screamed, very startled. He dropped his jacket in his panic. It fell on the figure with a \\'WUMPH\\'! Welcome to the Baylor home. \"Oog! Hey!\" It said/whined. \\'It\\' had a very small, childish voice. Zeke came down from his fight or flight mode with fast, heavy breaths. They slowed down eventually. He then focused an unamused look on the fallen jacket, with odd shapes being punched and kicked in it. He lifted it off like a magician to reveal... His five year old sister. \"Marie.\" He said with a very serious tone. \"What are you doing in here?\" He stated more than asked. \"It\\'s not my fault!\" She insisted, dark eyes looking very innocent. Whenever Marie insisted, it sounded like that bike kid from the Incredibles movie. Kind of sing-song. \"Alex put me in here!\" He sighed. \"Alex put you in here.\" \"Uh-huh!\" She nodded with big eyes, her raven curls bouncing. He sighed once again, this time with annoyance. Zeke looked further into the closet, seeing very clearly that the youngest Baylor\\'s step stool was missing. He held out a hand to her. \"Come on.\" Marie made a noise of effort as her brother pulled her on her feet. Zeke\\'s long strides across the house were outdoing her small ones, so he slowed down a bit. \"Where\\'s Mom and Dad?\" \"Mommy\\'s in her office on the phone with a client.\" She replied, as if reciting a previously given answer. Mrs. Baylor was a real estate worker, and often busy. She was fun and loving, but could be very stern when she wanted to be. \"Right. That explains why I\\'m not hearing Alex scream for mercy.\" He muttered. Marie giggled. \"And Dad?\" \"Daddy\\'s still at the construction site.\" She said. His father was a construction worker. He often came home after seven, sometimes eight. Currently, he and his fellow workers were working on a school auditorium. Mr. Baylor was the fun parent, he loved messing with his kids. Zeke and Marie stopped in front of a door. Before he could give a stern knock, hard and very rapid ones beat him to it. \"Alexander John Baylor you\\'re in big trouble mister!\" She said with almost hidden triumph. Her incredibly fast knocks didn\\'t cease. Someone needs to enter this girl in the talent show or something , Zeke thought to himself, How is she doing this? \"Alexander you open this door right now! We don\\'t close doors in this house!\" She spoke again. Zeke smirked quietly. It was kind of cute when Marie got mad. She was so short and her voice was so high, that she looked like a mouse demanding a lion to do it\\'s bidding. \"ALEXANDER I MEAN IT! YOU OPEN THIS DO-\" Before Zeke could tell the child to lower her voice, the door swung open to reveal ten year old Alex Baylor. \"Marie.\" He said with narrowed eyes, glaring at the angry child. \"Why-\" He smirked at her face. \"What\\'s up firecracker?\" \"You\\'re in big trouble.\" She growled. \"I told Zeke what you did. He\\'s not very happy you locked me in the closet. Where\\'s my stool?!\" \"Why, your stool is right here in the hall!\" Alex said with a mock gasp as he spoke. Zeke and Marie looked down to their right. He was right, there was the stool. \"It belongs in the closet Ale- \" Zeke began. \"You liar! That wasn\\'t here before and you know!\" Marie pointed. \"Oh really?\" Alex smirked. \"You took it when you locked me in the coat closet!\" She exclaimed. Alex gasped. \"Oh Marie...\" he cooed, stooping to her level. \"Did I lock you up in the coat closet? Poor thing, no lights and everything!\" he pinched her cheeks, shaking his hands like one of those ladies who think whatever they\\'re seeing is absolutely darling. \"We\\'re lucky you\\'re not afraid of the dark! You couldn\\'t even reach to get ou- \" \"Zeke Aaron Baylor! Do something!\" Marie demanded her other big brother. \"I was going to Marie, but you beat me to it.\" Zeke replied. Marie struggled to push Alex\\'s hands away, very annoyed. She spoke calmly, \"Zeke. Did I ask you what happened then? No. I\\'m asking you to do something now!\" Marie said with a frown. \"Alexander, quit it!\" Zeke sighed. \"Alex.\" His brother froze and stood. Alexander flashed a grin. \"Zeke!\" He said with open arms. \"Alex!\" Zeke imitated his tone before crossing his arms. No hugs for him. Alex was in hot water. \"Why\\'d you lock Marie in the closet?\" He asked his brother. Alex sighed. \"She was only in there for like...three minutes. It\\'s not like I wanted to keep her in there all night. She kept running in singing TV theme songs.\" Zeke raised a brow. \"More than one?\" Alex looked as if he was going to shudder. \"More than one. So... many, actually.\" They both looked down at their sister. She blinked. \"I was playing a game with my friends.\" He explained with a sigh, motioning to his Xbox. \"A game that took a lot of concentration.\" He said to Zeke but looked at Marie. \"Sorry Alex...\" Marie said sincerely. He smiled and patted her head. \"It\\'s okay, Tiny. I\\'m sorry too. The game is over now, we won. Wanna watch something?\" \"Okay!\" She smiled. \"Wait a second you two, did you eat?\" Zeke asked. \"Nope.\" Alex smiled. \"Mom said, \\'Tell Zeke to make dinner\\'.\" Marie grinned, reciting their mother\\'s words once again. \"Great.\" Zeke groaned. XxxxxxxxX At the Evans\\'s Mansion- which was farther away from the rest of the Wildcats of course- Kelsi exhaled as she finished singing her new piece to Sharpay. Sharpay was wearing her pajamas, curled up in a hot pink saucer chair. She\\'d hardly spoken a word since they left the restaurant. Welcome to the Evans Mansion \"Well?\" Kelsi asked nervously. Sharpay gave a short, quiet nod. \"It\\'s good.\" She stood. \"You should show it to Ms. Darbus. She\\'ll find something to do with it. She always does.\" \"Yeah...\" Kelsi laughed softly. Sharpay stood up to take her keys from the top of the piano. \"Let\\'s get you home. I promised to have you home before 9:30.\" \"Okay, thanks.\" Kelsi said as they left the music room, heading down the hall to the stairs. \"Hey, are you okay?\" she asked her friend. \"I\\'m fine. Thanks for asking though.\" Sharpay sighed and started down the steps. \"Annabelle?\" she called to one of the family\\'s maids. \"Yes sweetheart?\" A curvy brunette woman in her late 40\\'s, replied. She\\'d been with the Evans since they were in middle school. \"If Mommy and Daddy come home before you leave, can you please tell them that I\\'m dropping off Kelsi?\" She asked. \"Alright. Drive safely...\" Annabelle smiled before blinking at the teen. \"Darling...you\\'re wearing your pajamas.\" Sharpay nodded. \"What\\'s wrong? I\\'m just staying in the car.\" \"You don\\'t usually-\" Annabelle began before footsteps were heard. Ryan walked in eating a cookie. \"Thanks for the cookies Anna.\" He smiled. \"Of course!\" She chirped. \"I\\'m glad you like them!\" Before she could turn back to ask more questions, Sharpay answered her. \"I\\'m fine Anna, I promise.\" \"Alright then.\" Annabelle smiled, leaving it at that. Kelsi smiled at Ryan as they started towards the door and he smiled back. \"Later, Kelsi.\" He waved. \"Bye...\" She smiled and waved back. Kelsi and Sharpay left the house, heading to Sharpay\\'s pink car. Sharpay unlocked the car and another worker by the name of Wayne opened the door for each girl. \"Thanks.\" Sharpay said quietly, getting in and inserting her key. Kelsi\\'s door closed and she went to put on her seatbelt. \"Where are your parents?\" She asked. Sharpay adjusted her rearview mirror. \"Dinner party. Someone important had a birthday.\" \"Oh.\" Kelsi replied. They pulled out of the driveway and left the home. \"Is your mom back yet?\" Sharpay asked after a moment. \"Um...yeah. She got back about...two hours ago. She text me earlier when the jet landed. I\\'m texting her back now.\" Kelsi replied, typing on her cell phone. \"Oh, that\\'s great.\" Sharpay nodded. \"Glad she\\'s home safely.\" \"Me too.\" Kelsi smiled. \"Luke is probably excited to hear what happened on the trip.\" Luke was Kelsi\\'s older brother, he was 25. \"Oh, I know it!\" Sharpay said. They both laughed at her statement. The pair kept talking like this as they cruised down the streets of New Mexico. XxxxxxxxX Martha pulled up to Jason\\'s house very slowly. Jason smirked. \"Martha you have to let me go.\" She gave him a pout. \"But I don\\'t wanna.\" He kissed her cheek and the car stopped. \"Fine...\" Martha groaned. Jason smiled. \"Thanks!\" he opened the car door. \"Night, beautiful.\" He waved \"Night Jason!\" Martha giggled. The boy could be a doofus, but he was adorable. Jason waved one more time before opening the gate and going to the front door. He unlocked it and went inside. A pretty hazel haired woman with red lipstick sat on the couch, writing something on one of the many papers that were near her on the coffee table. She lifted her head, noticing his entrance. \"Hi, darling.\" She greeted him with a smile. \"Hey.\" He walked over to to give her a small hug from behind the couch before going to the kitchen. The kitchen was right next to the living room. A wall with an open rectangle (so you could see into the other room) separated the two. \"How was your day?\" She asked. \"It was cool, how was yours?\" \"Busy.\" She sighed, her lovely smile not once leaving her face. \"Aw, I\\'m sorry.\" He said \"Where\\'s Dad?\" She rolled her eyes. \"In the basement, with his beloved piano. He\\'s making weird faces while he plays again.\" \"Wow, thanks a lot.\" A voice said. A dark haired man walked in, wearing a tux and a smirk. was a pianist (a very good pianist, actually). He would play at weddings, funerals, graduations, social events- you name it. He also recorded music. \"Nice song.\" The woman smirked back. \"Hence the weird faces.\" Jason\\'s father, Evan, stuck his tongue out at her. \"Grow up.\" Her face scrunched up. Who was she, exactly? That was Rose. Rose was a beautiful, slim woman with shoulder length- as said- hazel hair. She usually had the ends flipped out instead of in like other women did. It looked fantastic on her though. Jason was related to her, but she wasn\\'t his mom. In fact, she was- The two looked up when they heard two soft car beeps. The door opened. \"Hey, Uncle Evan and Jase. Hi Mom.\" Kelsi smiled at Rose. Kelsi\\'s mom. Welcome to the Cross-Nielsen Home \"Hi, darling!\" Rose smiled, Kelsi gave her a hug after giving Evan her crutches. \"How was the trip?\" Kelsi asked when they broke apart, moving to the couch. A small golden Maltese ran up to her, causing her to gasp in delight. \"Hey Treble!\" she greeted her dog, with a proud smile. \"Great, actually!\" Rose said. \"The new products look great and Jordan is working very nicely! She\\'s so mature, professional, and excellent in her work might I add. You can see the pride in her father\\'s eyes.\" Rose smiled. Rose was the secretary to the wealthy CEO of a company called, McKessie Enterprises. Oh yes. You read that right. McKessie Enterprises , a business owned by Tyler McKessie (but more on him later). \"Luke was so bummed that he had to stay behind this time.\" Kelsi snickered, letting Treble Clef run off again. Rose made a sympathetic puppy face. \"Aw...where is he?\" She looked around. The back door opened. A tall, darker haired boy came in. He looked exhausted, but he smiled at everyone anyway. \"Oh, hey mom! When did you come home?\" He gave her a hug before moving to give Kelsi one. \"Hey, Kels.\" \"Hey! Two hours ago.\" Kelsi whispered. \"Oooh...\" Luke winced. \"I\\'m sorry mom, I got distracted. I have an idea that I really think Mr. McKessie will like.\" He explained, wiping his forehead with his sleeve. \"He likes all of your ideas sweetheart.\" She smiled, Luke beamed at this. Luke had a smile that made you think he was a salesman, but it was genuine. His skin was a bit darker, (tan if you will?) than Kelsi\\'s. He was 25 years old with a passion for changing the world and he loved making new gadgets to use, currently for himself or the house. Though he was an adult, Luke still lived with his family. They had small two guest homes on the property. One home was for Jason and his dad, and the other was for Luke. Luke\\'s ideas and inventions usually resided in his \\'office\\'. He worked with his mom at McKessie Enterprises, but it was currently as an apprentice. Tyler McKessie loved the way he thought, and the McKessie\\'s had known him since he was little. They were best friends with Rose back in high school and hadn\\'t separated since. So whenever there was a checkup at the company\\'s base, Rose would take Luke and Tyler would take his daughter Jordan. The two were future team members (two smart and creative future team members). However, this time Luke stayed due to another gadget. It happened a few times. \"So how\\'s Jordan?\" Luke asked his mother. \"She\\'s smarter and prettier by the day.\" Rose smiled. \"One more year of college and she\\'ll be working beside you until she begins to take over for her father.\" Jordan was 20 years old and attended the University of Albuquerque. Luke nodded. \"Great! Now, I\\'m starving. Who wants dinner?\" \"I do!\" Jason, Kelsi, Rose, and Evan replied. XxxxxxxxX Martha dropped her bag on the couch before heading to her room. She really wanted to take a nap. However, that was soon denied when her almost closed door was knocked open with a karate kick. \"HeeeeYA!\" A slightly high female voice sounded. Martha\\'s head snapped up. That voice belonged to someone she knew very well. \"HanNAH!\" Martha groaned before flipping around to look at the culprit. Welcome to the Cox household. \"Hi hi!\" She waved. Hannah was a redhead, but it was so dark people often saw it as brown from afar. Her hair was down and curled, reaching her shoulder blades. Her pearly smile ever present, red lipstick making it more clear. \"Wh aaaaaa !\" She heard another silly voice, slightly lower. The voice came with another female, slowly somersaulting into her room. \"Adrien!\" Martha protested to the other one. The other girl stood. \"Hey, sis.\" She winked. Adrien Cox had regular brown hair. She wore it in a fishtail braid that went over her shoulder. Her smile was usually small, and gentle. They were fraternal, they were 25, and they were the Cox twins. They were also gymnasts. Very good gymnasts. Hannah jumped onto the bed. \"We\\'re home for the week and you come home to take a NAP? You didn\\'t even say hello! That\\'s so rude!\" They were full of energy at the moment. \"Mom and Dad went to the store to get some snacks. \"Adrien said, being the calmer one of the two, her voice was softer. \"We\\'re gonna watch a movie as a family when they get home. So get up and come help us bring blankets to the living room.\" \"I\\'m tired guys! I\\'ve been out all day!\" Martha tried to reason with her sisters. They stared at her. \"Fine then.\" Hannah pouted, sticking her nose in the air before slamming the mattress with her hands and army growling. \"WE NEVER SLEEP!\" \"CAUSE SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!\" Adrien replied, \"WE NEVER SLEEP!\" \"CAUSE SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!\" \"You guys!\" Martha whined. \"WE NEVER SLEEP! CAUSE SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!\" The twins chanted, full of energy. They must have slept on their flight from Michigan. They went to Michigan State University. They were attending on a gymnastics scholarship. Both twins were majoring in sports medicine. \"WE NEVER SLEEP! CAUSE SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK!\" They continued. Martha groaned. \"NO!\" Adrien and Hannah pouted. \"Pleeeeeeease?\" They chorused to their younger sibling. Martha blew her bangs from her face with narrowed eyes. \"Fine.\" \"YAY!\" They cheered and hugged her. Martha couldn\\'t help but smile a little. \"Welcome home, you two.\" This was gonna be a long night. Please Review! Next up, our main 4! Anyone up for a Troyella fluff?'][Chapter 8] [\"Read this Note Everyone xD Note: The following author notes are old but I don't feel like editing and deleting. SO if you guys see old notes, it's because I'm trying to work on the actual chapter lol. Some of them are important though so I would advise reading them (especially the extremely important one coming up). It's literally so important that I just separated the next chapter from it so you guys can pay attention to it xD. Old Note: *Smiles* Happy New Year lovelys. That is all. See you at the bottom! Well, WildatsLabyrinth2018, thanks for reviewing! I promised you fluff, AND FLUFF YOU SHALL HAVE! Oh. I forgot a cast break. Diana McKessie- Jennifer Hudson Tyler McKessie- Jamie Foxx Jordan McKessie- Gabrielle Union Natalie Gonzalez is played by Phoebe Tonkin. (Mr. and Mrs. Danforth already have been seen in HSM3 so I won't cast them) I'll do a full casting page soon so I don't have to keep doing this. IMPORTANT NOTE 2019: This series could be classified as a musical series. I mean, the movie was a musical so nothing should be too different y'know? It'll be fine (it's worked on the AU stories so far. No one has complained, I've actually seen the opposite lol). Some episodes will have musical scenes, some won't. When there IS a musical scene, I would 100% advise listening to the song while reading. There is actually a Spotify for this to make it easier for you guys! It made me smile on The Wedding Planner when I saw how many of you guys went to the link I put up. It was amazing and my heart grew 3 sizes. So I made a Spotify account (Username is ADSPC) with the soundtracks for each season with the songs (so far, subject to change) in order (also subject to change). The link for this season is on my profile, so go check that out before reading further. Anyways, in this story, you saw Masterpiece. Now it is time for the second song, If I Never Knew You from Pocahontas. THIS VERSION IS JON SECADA AND SHANICE. THIS SONG WILL COME BACK LATER IN THE FOLLOW-UP SERIES 'GROW UP' BUT IN A DIFFERENT VERSION. So it's very important to have the right one xD. I n this series (and those that follow), 3 asterisks (***) beside a line mean to start the song if you're using it xDD. Have fun! Thanks for reading!\"][Chapter 9] ['Link to Season 1\\'s Playlist: (open dot spotify dot com slash) user/ynqdxbe00t5c9pyz8nzv2ajoz/playlist/2sTuLU8SeaYezKhYBQ7wbX?si=BxlzrbBjQfSJXQ1aeMchqQ And if that didn\\'t show up on the doc guys (websites usually don\\'t and I have class in a bit so I\\'m not coming back just to check that lol), just follow ADSPC on Spotify and click on 16andUp Season 1 soundtrack xD. The song will be there. The song is: If I Never Knew You by Jon Secada and Shanice (***) means to start the song. Have fun! Thank goodness the bus had arrived. The 5 minutes of awkward silence with moments of Chad messing with Taylor had become annoying to her and boring to him. When they boarded the bus, their eyes widened. It was crowded more than it usually was. There wasn\\'t an empty seat in sight. Even the standing poles had people hanging onto them. Each pole was occupied except for one in the middle of the vehicle. They\\'d have to share and hold on. Chad and Taylor shuffled through to the pole, each latching a hand onto it. The bus doors closed and they were off. Chad was a little taller than Taylor so his hand was on the upper half of the pole. Taylor took the lower half and the two tried to keep their hands off of each other\\'s. After two minutes, Chad whispered to Taylor, \"Where is everyone even going?\" \"I don\\'t know…\" She looked around the bus discreetly. \"They don\\'t seem to be in a group?\" \"Yeah, I don\\'t think so. I\\'m pretty sure that guy over there isn\\'t with that young lady.\" Chad whispered back, discreetly motioning over to the back of the bus. A woman wearing a dress had her legs crossed, her thumb typing away on her phone. A guy who looked older and if they were being honest) not his complete right mind, started to- \"Oh my gosh, is he smelling her neck?!\" Taylor hissed under her breath in alarm. \"That\\'s weird. What should we do? Can we do something? Does she not feel this?!\" Chad hissed with equally wide eyes. \"It has to be cold as heck. That\\'s an inhale in January.\" Taylor cringed \"Hello!\" Chad squeaked quietly as the guy\\'s lips almost touched the woman\\'s neck. Suddenly the man yelped due to the woman had stepping on his foot with her heel. Taylor and Chad\\'s tried to hold in their snickers when the woman stared at her phone as if nothing had happened at all. \"That was great!\" Taylor laughed. \"Sh!\" Chad teased. She giggled some more before playfully punching him. After a minute or two of messing around, they cleared their throats. The rest of the ten minute drive went by uneventfully. The bus came to a stop. \"This is my stop.\" Taylor said. \"Oh, okay. Goodnight Taylor.\" Chad said as she moved towards the front of the bus to go down the stairs. \"Goodnight. Oh and, Danforth?\" Taylor called. \"Yeah?\" \"I got off the bus first. Proving, that I was the one protecting you.\" She smirked triumphantly. \"Wait. Hey!\" Chad called in protest as the doors closed. Taylor watched as the bus drove away before starting to walk to her house. She sighed and put her key in the door, turning it and walking inside. \"Mom, I\\'m home!\" She called out, closing the door. \"Taylor, is that you?\" She heard in response. \"Well Mom, everyone else is home except Taylor. So yeah, that would have to be her.\" Taylor heard another voice say. Taylor gave a small smirk at that comment, walking further into the house. Her mother, Diana McKessie, walked into the room. \"Hi darling!\" she smiled at her youngest daughter. Diana wore a black dress and matching heels. Her long and dark brown hair curled against her shoulders. The dress hugged her slim but curvy figure quite nicely. \"Hey, Mom!\" Taylor smiled, giving her a hug. \"Hi sweetheart!\" Diana smiled fondly, gently kissing her forehead. Welcome To The McKessie Household Taylor gently pulled away with a smile. \"So, I thought I heard Jordan. Is Dad with her?\" Diana nodded. \"They came home a while ago, they\\'re working still, but not as hard. They\\'re in your father\\'s office so you can say hi. As a matter of fact, I was just in there. Why don\\'t you join us?\" Taylor smiled and nodded and Diana offered her hand. Taylor took it and they made their way around the corner to a room with double glass doors. Window coverings made the area inside invisible. Diana knocked and - or Tyler- opened the door. \"Hi, princess!\" He smiled to Taylor, giving her a hug. \"Daddy!\" Taylor squealed. Diana smiled, going into the office. Tyler and Taylor broke apart from their hug, causing Taylor to see her older sister Jordan, who was 20. \"Hey, Tay!\" Jordan grinned, looking up from her laptop. She had her legs crossed, her black heels still on her feet. Jordan wore black dress pants accompanied by a black shirt. A blue overcoat completed the outfit perfectly. Like their mother, she too, had long dark brown hair that curled against her shoulders. \"JJ!\" Taylor hugged her. Jordan laughed. \"How was your trip?\" Taylor smiled breathlessly. She hadn\\'t seen Tyler and Jordan in a week. \"Excellent, we saw a lot of new things.\" Tyler smiled. \"Luke and Jordan were funny though. Jordan called Luke after and told him about all the new products we saw. I could hear his voice through the phone!\" He laughed. \"He sounded like a hyper puppy!\" Jordan laughed. Luke and Jordan were close despite the five year age difference. Jordan was next in line to take over the company for her father, which she would start to do at the age of 25. When she was ready- and when Tyler thought she was ready- she would step up. Luke wanted to work for the company one day as well and showed a great interest in creating new things. Due to him being his secretary/ best friend\\'s son, Tyler was fond of the boy and decided to train him for a high position alongside Jordan. The two trainees had known each other her entire life and shared a fascination for the new inventions at Tyler\\'s company every time they went to check on it\\'s headquarters in New York. What was his company? McKessie Enterprises. It was a company where new inventors grouped with Tyler McKessie- who was an inventor himself- to make their dreams come to life. A lot of the inventions went to the upper class though. They could afford cool stuff like that. Well, the upper class and the McKessies themselves. \"No fair! I wish I could have gone.\" Taylor groaned. Jordan gave an evil cackle. \"You\\'re too little! You have school and I did my classwork in New York. So I got to be with the cool stuff. That\\'s just how it is sis.\" \"Jordan!\" Diana playfully slapped her leg. Taylor gave a triumphant laugh and Tyler smiled as he stood next to his wife\\'s chair. She looked up at him and they both smirked. XxxxxxxxX Chad stepped off the bus, his face still scrunched from Taylor\\'s earlier remark. He walked up to his doorstep before opening the front door to his home. A small but joyful gasp sounded. \"Chad!\" He heard a squeal. A little girl with shoulder length curly hair and overalls came running at him full speed. That little girl would be his four year old sister Christine. Welcome to the Danforth Home. Chad felt something on his leg, it was Christine. He looked down at her to see that she had started frowning. \"Is something wrong, big brother?\" She blinked her big brown eyes up at him. Chad had realized he was still frowning. He laughed. \"Sorry, Christine, Taylor was getting on my nerves.\" Even the four year old knew of the loathing (although fading due to their friendship) between the two. \"Oh, good!\" She exhaled. \"I thought it was me.\" \"No, sunshine.\" He picked her up and she cuddled into his shoulder. \"There you are, princess!\" Chad\\'s father, Charlie Danforth, said as he came into the living room. \"You ran off at the speed of light.\" \"Dad! Chris!\" Chad heard a voice that belonged to his 12 year old brother James. \"Can you come back? I\\'m starving!\" He whined. \"Now James, you are not starving. Don\\'t be dramatic.\" Chad heard a chuckle, belonging to his mother Elizabeth Danforth. \"Chill, James.\" He teased. \"Never!\" James laughed. \"Hey Chad. Hurry and get in here please. Mom made pie.\" James loved pie. \"Hold on champ.\" Charlie smirked. He placed a hand on Chad\\'s back. \"So, how was practice?\" \"Um…\" Chad thought. \"There wasn\\'t practice today, just meetings. Troy and I met with the guys at lunch and I handled my guys during free period.\" Chad said. By his guys he meant the baseball team. There Chad wasn\\'t co-captain, he was the captain. \"That\\'s good.\" Charlie nodded. \"You\\'re gonna kill it this season right?\" \"Of course.\" Chad grinned. \"My brother always kills it.\" Christine said as if it were obvious. \"Tell him, Chris.\" Chad beamed at his little sister. Charlie fist bumped Chad. \"That\\'s my boy.\" \"Charlie! Chad!\" Eliza called out. \"Please come eat, James is about to make like a racoon with this pie.\" They looked at each other. Christine included. Chad started running, holding squealing Christine like a football kind of. \"James!\" \"Come eat!\"James exclaimed. Charlie laughed, walking to the kitchen. XxxxxxxxX Troy sighed as he logged off his station at Best Buy so one of the adult workers could get it. \"Man, that was busy.\" He blinked. It was a month after Christmas, so maybe these were the late returners. Either way, Troy\\'s brain felt like he\\'d been running a race, and when he\\'d finally won, all the pain and exhaustion became evident. \"Hey Troy.\" He heard. Troy turned around to see Natalie. \"Hey Natalie!\" He gave a weak smile. \"What\\'s up?\" \"I just had to return something for my dad.\" She explained, motioning to . \"I forgot that you worked here, actually.\" \"Um, yeah!\" Troy smiled. \"I started last…. August, I think!\" \"Oh, that\\'s great!\" Natalie replied. \"I remember hearing that. I think you had a celebration at the diner with your...friends...that day. Amber mentioned that she saw you guys there.\" She cleared her cheerleaders and jocks were close in middle school. That was one of the main reasons why they enforced the status quo so much during freshman year on. With everyone beginning to mix, the group wasn\\'t as cool or \\'tight\\' as they would have liked to be. Some of them still believed statuses shouldn\\'t mix. Natalie was in between but tended to gravitate towards the old way. Ever since Gabriella had come around, Troy seemed to want to hang out with her and Amber less...it sucked. She began to speak again, looking down a little. \"Hey, um…\" she looked up at him again, \"A few of us are having a party at my place... two Saturdays from now? It\\'s my birthday party.\" Troy thought. \"I don\\'t know, Nat….a lot could happen between now and then. I\\'ll have to check my schedules.\" Natalie groaned. \"Troy...we never hang out anymore.\" \"I know...I\\'m sorry about that.\" He sighed. He really did feel bad about it, but he wasn\\'t sure what to do. \"Ever since you met that nerd girl-\" She began, Troy started to protest but she kept talking, \"You, Chad and the others have been so distant.\" She continued. \"She\\'s nice, don\\'t get me wrong. But...we miss hanging around you guy-\" \"Troy!\" He heard, Natalie sighed in defeat. Gabriella walked up with a bright and bubbly smile. She was waving a small paper bag at him as she walked over. \"Hey Wildcat!\" she greeted her boyfriend. \"Hey, sweetheart.\" He smiled, hooking an arm around her waist. \"Whatcha got there?\" he tickled her sides a little, causing her to giggle. \"Hey!\" Gabi laughed before clearing her throat and resuming her previous posture. \"Hi Natalie…\" she said softly with a kind smile. Natalie gave a soft nod up. \"Gabriella.\" Gabiella blinked. It was normal that the cheerleaders didn\\'t like her, but it still stung. Natalie at least said hello, but Gabriella could tell that her presence still irked the girl. Natalie\\'s dark eyes were focused on Gabriella. Her eyes were enchanting dark pools that could tempt even the most loyal man. Her dark hair was tucked underneath a hat she wore atop her head, the ends curled slightly against her shoulders neatly. She was perfect and everyone knew it. The girls at school sometimes called Natalie \\'The snake\\' because she would \\'slither\\' her way around school with her curvy hips softly swaying, hazel eyes ever confident, and presence naturally seductive. The boys practically kissed the ground that she walked on, no matter what status they were. Even if she would coldly brush them off, it was worth it just to be acknowledged by her. The jocks were really the only ones with chances. Like Troy…but the cheerleaders were like their best friends. Gabriella doubted that any of the boys in the group would actually consider dating them. What was Natalie talking to Troy about anyway? Natalie suddenly broke the stillness, straightening up again. She wore a form fitting blue shirt that suited her very nicely. She looked down at it, noticed how one side of the shirt\\'s hem was higher than the other, and went to pull it down for an even adjustment. She looked at him to see Troy blink, completely unfazed. \"Whatcha got there, Gabs?\" Gabriella blinked and held a bag out to him. \"I stopped at Subway on the way here, I thought you might be hungry so I got you what you normally get. I figured we could ride the bus together and walk home.\" She smiled. \"Sweet!\" Troy\\'s face lit up. \"Isn\\'t she the best?!\" he smooshed Gabi\\'s face, joking to Natalie. \"The greatest!\" Natalie laughed. However, he still looked somewhat irked by Gabriella\\'s presence. Gabriella began to think to herself again, zoning out of the conversation Natalie and Troy had started about an upcoming game. \"Why didn\\'t Troy date Natalie? They get along so well… Would they have gotten together if I hadn\\'t come to East High?\" She thought. Suddenly, Natalie laughed and playfully slapped Troy\\'s arm. \"Shut up! You\\'re putting those bad thoughts in the air! Then we\\'ll lose!\" She exclaimed. \"I\\'m just saying, another blackout could happen!\" Troy laughed back. \"What if West High is all like \\'Keep playing losers! Let\\'s get em while the lights are off and-\\'-\" \"Shut up!\" Natalie laughed and Troy pulled her into a friendly hug, she hit at his chest playfully. Natalie smiled at the gesture and hugged him back. When Gabriella saw how content Natalie looked as she hugged her boyfriend, at first she felt a pang of jealousy and possessiveness. What Gabriella did not expect to feel however, was guilt. Natalie gently slugged Troy. \"Alright, don\\'t keep her waiting. I\\'ll see you at school, okay?\" \"Yeah.\" Troy smiled at her. \"Come on, Gabi.\" he held his girlfriend\\'s hand and started walking out. \"Text me if you can come!\" Natalie called out, hugging herself and hoping he\\'d heard her. She sighed, going to get her stuff and drive home. XxxxxxxxX Gabi and Troy waited at the bus stop again. Troy was humming \\'Getcha Head In The Game\\'. For a clique that wasn\\'t into musicals, the basketball team made some nice impromptu songs. Gabriella quietly tapped her foot along with his humming before they both started slightly bouncing side to side, launching into small discreet dance moves. Troy reached the end of the song. \"You gotta getcha getcha getcha getcha head in the game-\" \"Whooooo.\" They both whispered aloud. Troy laughed and pulled Gabriella close to him, nuzzling his face into her head a little. Gabriella sighed happily into his embrace. Then, she thought about Natalie. Gabriella tensed as she thought of how pretty she was and how she was exactly in Troy\\'s league. When he was with her, they always got weird stares and judgement. If he was with Natalie, he wouldn\\'t have to deal with anything like that. She couldn\\'t deny that they\\'d make a cute couple. So why didn\\'t he just date her instead? Troy looked down at Gabi when he noticed that she was frowning. \"Gab?\" Troy asked softly. \"Yeah?\" she whispered. \"What\\'s wrong?\" … \"What were you talking to Natalie about?\" Gabriella asked quietly. \"She looked upset when I walked up and I didn\\'t want to make her sad...or mad...or both.\" \"It was nothing, really. I don\\'t think it bothered Nat too much, you didn\\'t know. Besides, she was just inviting me to a party that\\'s all.\" He replied. \"A party?\" Troy blinked, trying to remember what Natalie had been saying. \"Um..yeah something about us not hanging out since the rule change and us drifting apart? I don\\'t even know if I\\'ll go-\" his eyes widened in shock when he heard a sniffle. \"Gabriella?!\" He held her at arm\\'s length and saw a tear roll down her cheek. \"Gabi, what\\'s wrong?\" She wiped her eyes. \"I-I\\'m sorry...I didn\\'t mean to take you from your old friends…\" \"Oh, Gabi…\" He cooed, rubbing her cheek softly with his thumb. \"I chose to do that. I didn\\'t mean to drift that far, but Nat and I are still friends. Everyone is still friends.\" \"But you used to be close!\" Gabriella pointed out. \"When I came to the school, everything changed.\" she looked away. \"For the better!\" Troy insisted, making her look at him again. \"No, Troy, not completely. Friend groups fell apart and even more separation happened. All because a jock and a brainiac fell in love.\" She grumbled. \"You gave up a few things to be with me too.\" Troy stared at her. \"Is there something wrong with that?\" he asked quietly. She looked away. \"Well...sometimes I think that it would have been better if we hadn\\'t met.\" she confessed. *** (Reminder since it\\'s the first run: Start the song now if you have it up. Also, italics and bold mean that there\\'s a flashback scene. Bold is the song, italics is the flashback.) Troy\\'s eyes widened. \"Gabriella...no.\" he gently turned her face to him again. \"Don\\'t ever think that.\" \"And why not?\" Gabriella asked softly. \"Because meeting you...it changed me. Believe me, it was for the better. It changed so many others too.\" He said softly. \"Without you...I\\'d still be lost.\" She looked at him in awe. Troy took a breath, looking into her eyes. \"Gabi…\" \"If I never knew you, if I never felt this love, I would have no inkling of- how precious life can be….\" he sang softly. He gently pulled Gabriella closer to him again. \"And if I never held you, I would never have a clue, how at last, I\\'d find in you-\" He looked at her again, chuckling softly, almost in disbelief. \"The missing part of me…in this world so full of fear- full of rage and lies…\" He tilted her head up to look at him. \"I can see the truth so clear, in your eyes, so dry your eyes.\" He wiped her tears, swaying softly. \"And I\\'m so grateful to you. I\\'d have lived my whole life through~ lost forever, If I never knew you…\" Gabriella cuddled into him. She inhaled before singing with him. \"If I never knew you, I\\'d be safe but half as real. Never knowing I could feel, A love so strong and true….\" She looked up at him. \"I\\'m so grateful to you. I\\'d have lived my whole life through~ lost forever. If I never knew you…\" Troy smiled at her. \"I thought our love would be so beautiful…\" Troy said. \"Somehow we\\'d make the whole world bright.\" Gabriella shrugged at him. They looked away with eyes of concern. \"I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong. All they\\'d leave us where these whispers in the night.\" Troy and Gabriella sang before looking back at each other and nodding. \"But still my heart is singing, we were right.\" \"If I never knew you,\" (There\\'s no moment I regret) They remembered when they were at the park. Gabi had been swinging. Troy grinned as he pushed her. \"Troy! Troy too high!\" Gabriella giggled and screamed. \"Oh, sorry babe!\" He blinked, realizing just how high she was going. He then smiled at her laughter. She was amazing. \" If I never knew this love,\" (Since the moment that we met) Troy made a slam dunk and the buzzer went off. The Wildcats had won yet another game. \"YEAH!\" The rest of the team screamed as the gym erupted into chaos. Troy felt someone slam into him, hugging him tightly. He looked down to see his beautiful girlfriend grinning at him. \"You did it!\" She jumped up and down. \"I did!\" He laughed. \"Oh my gosh, I\\'m so proud of you!\" Gabi hugged him again. Troy smiled and hugged her back, resting his head on hers. \"I love you.\" he said sincerely. Gabriella smiled up at him. \"I love you too, wildcat.\" \" I would have no inkling of\" (If our time has gone too fast, I\\'ve lived at last.) \" How precious life can be\" Gabriella slammed her buzzer during a class game. \"The answer is Pi!\" She grinned. \"Correct!\" Their teacher beamed. \"Yeah! That\\'s my girlfriend!\" Troy cheered and pointed at Gabriella as she moved back to her seat, a blush coloring her cheeks. \"We know, Troy. Sit down.\" Chad groaned from behind him. \"Never.\" He whispered. \"Troy sit down.\" \"Yes Mrs. Johnson.\" \"I thought our love would be so beautiful. Somehow we made the whole world bright.\" Troy and Gabi walked through the halls, holding hands. It was happy and peaceful until they walked past the rest of the Jock\\'s lockers. \"There they go.\" One of the basketball players by the name of Jake sighed. \"I don\\'t get this.\" Amber grumbled. Natalie rolled her eyes. She was in mean queen mode but her eyes were sad. \"This isn\\'t how any of this is supposed to be.\" Ian- another basketball player- sighed. Gabriella looked down before pulling and speed walking away from Troy. \" I thought our love would be so beautiful. We\\'d turn the darkness into light.\" Troy found her hiding by the bathroom. He hugged her close and said, \"Hey...don\\'t pay attention to any of them. They don\\'t know how to accept change.\" \"Yeah, change,\" Gabriella mumbled sadly. \"It\\'s a great change.\" Troy smiled. \"Look at how happy others are.\" He pointed to a set of lockers where a skater high fived a drama teen. The pair laughed, enjoying each others company. Gabriella smiled at the sight. \"All of this is because of you, beautiful,\" Troy said gently. \"Thanks, Troy.\" Gabriella sighed, hugging him. \" And still my heart is singing, we were right.\" \" We were right.\" \"And If I never knew you-\" Troy looked and saw the bright lights of the bus approaching. \"I\\'d have lived my whole life through…\" Gabriella sighed softly, nuzzling into Troy. \"Empty as the sky…\" The couple looked at each other and laughed, shaking their heads. \"Never knowing why…\" \"Lost, forever, if I never knew…. \" They whispered as the bus stopped. They gave each other\\'s hands a gentle squeeze but kept their eyes on the doors. \"You…\" the doors opened and they boarded the bus. XxxxxxxxX Gabriella waved as Troy left the bus stop when they got off. Soon, he entered his house where his parents Jack and Lucille Bolton were waiting for him. The Boltons need no introduction needed, they\\'re a well-known family. Nevertheless, Welcome to the Bolton Home \"Hi, honey.\" Lucille smiled as he kissed her on the cheek. She was making a salad. \"Hey, Dad. Hey, Mom.\" Troy smiled. \"Can I help?\" \"Sure!\" Lucille beamed, handing her son lettuce and a cutting board. Jack gave a sly smile. \"We leave school at the same time kiddo. It took you longer to get home from work than usual. Did dream girl stop by?\" Lucille smirked at her husband\\'s question. Troy blushed. He looked at his dad and placed some tomatoes on the table near him. \"You can help wash, Dad.\" His parents laughed. XxxxxxxxX Gabriella walked into the kitchen of her home. She saw her mother and uncle standing at the island counter that had a few papers on it. They looked up with surprised faces when they noticed her entry before giving her warm smiles. \"Hey, Mom. Hey Uncle. What\\'s up?\" She smiled. \"Hey, kiddo.\" Her uncle, Antonio (or Tony), smiled softly. \"Hi, honey.\" Her mom gave a weaker smile. \"How was school?\" Isabella asked. \"It was good. Um...is something wrong?\" Gabriella blinked before being met with a moment of silence. Gabriella\\'s eyes moved to the island where she saw a letter for her mother. She picked it up and read some of it before her eyes widened. Gabriella then looked back up to stare at her mother. \"What is this? She whispered. Isabella took a breath before answering her, \"Gabriella, I think I found another job…\" She said softly. Welcome to the Montez home… Or house. Leaping Lizards, that was the last remodeled chapter! We\\'re finally all caught up with the old version! I only own my OC\\'s and ideas, so obviously I don\\'t own things like Subway and Best Buy xD. Anyways, thank you all for reading! I hope you enjoyed this chapter. Please feel free to leave a comment below and tell me what you think! It\\'s a wonderful motivation source and would be much appreciated. Thanks WildcatsLabyrinth2018 for your review! More to come!'][Chapter 10] ['In this chapter, we look into the lives of some of the other characters (specifically, the Nielsen family and Jordan McKessie). Enjoy the chapter! It was later in the evening when Taylor walked downstairs to the living room and saw her sister typing away on her laptop. Taylor announced her presence by gently clearing her throat, causing Jordan to look up. \"Hey.\" Taylor smiled softly. \"Hey.\" Jordan smiled back with tired eyes. \"Shouldn\\'t you be in bed? You have school tomorrow.\" \"I know. I just wanted to say goodnight because I know you\\'ll have class by the time I get back tomorrow.\" Taylor explained, walking over to lean down and rest on the frame of the couch. \"What are you up to?\" Jordan looked at her laptop screen. \"Um….\" she hummed, gently rubbing her eyes. \"I have a paper due tomorrow so I\\'m just adding the finishing touches. I\\'m also looking over a project proposal that one of Dad\\'s employees sent in.\" \"You\\'re in on that whole process now?\" Taylor asked, looking at her sister. \"Yep.\" Jordan answered, scrolling down the document. \"Indeed I am.\" \"That\\'s great, congratulations.\" Taylor said, impressed. \"What\\'s this one about?\" \"I believe it\\'s a flying toaster.\" Jordan answered with slow nods. \" Oh .\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"Do you um...Do you think it will make it?\" Taylor asked, trying to hide her amused tone. \"Oh, not in the slightest.\" Jordan replied with a laugh. \"It doesn\\'t seem safe at all. Though a vast majority of people enjoy the idea of breakfast in bed, the model could use some work.\" \"From the looks of it, it\\'s basically being held up by a metallic version of one of those spinners that you see on top of those rainbow hats.\" Taylor scrunched up her nose in doubt of the design. Jordan looked up to give her a fond smile, \"Propeller hat, hon.\" \"Whatever you say.\" Taylor laughed. \"Night JJ, love you. Good luck with your paper, and the propeller toaster.\" \"Night Tay, love you too.\" Jordan laughed with her. \"Sweet dreams.\" She said as Taylor walked to the staircase. Jordan slightly frowned to herself and thought for a moment. \"Hey, Tay?\" Jordan called quietly. \"Yeah?\" Taylor replied, turning to look at her curiously. \"...Do you think that I\\'m meant to take over the company? Honestly?\" She asked. \"Why do you ask?\" \"I\\'m just curious.\" Taylor thought for a moment. \"Well, you\\'ve been training for it for practically your entire life.\" She replied. \"Why wouldn\\'t you be?\" Jordan gave a light shrug and answered, \"I don\\'t know.\" Taylor looked at her older sister with a curious and slightly concerned look in her eyes. \"Is there...something you want to talk about?\" She asked. \"No, I\\'m good.\" Jordan said with a warm smile. \"Just checking.\" Taylor smiled back and said, \"You\\'ll be great. I know you will. You\\'re you .\" Jordan nodded. \"Thanks, sis.\" \"Of course. Night.\" Taylor waved. \"Night…\" Jordan waved back before going back to her work. Seconds turned into minutes and minutes turned into hours before Jordan had completed her tasks. When she knew she was done for the night, Jordan checked the time on a nearby wall clock. It was 10 PM. Jordan sighed, gently rubbing her temples before shutting her laptop. Then, she stood and picked up her heels from earlier, going upstairs. Though she soon entered her room and put her laptop down, Jordan was not checking in for the night quite yet. She had an errand to run. Jordan went to her closet and knelt down to replace her heels for a pair simple black sneakers on her shoe rack. Suddenly, she felt a presence behind her. \"Night, baby girl.\" Diana said softly, pecking her forehead. Jordan flinched, giving a tiny squeak. \"Mom!\" She whined. \"Don\\'t do that!\" Diana laughed. \"Sorry, honey.\" she smiled. \"Your class ends at 5:15 tomorrow right?\" Jordan nodded. \"Alright, I\\'ll see you then. Remember that it\\'s movie night okay? We start at 8. Night, dear. I love you!\" \"Okay, mom. Night, love you too!\" Jordan smiled as she left the room. She finished tying her shoes and stood up, walking to retrieve her purse from her window seat across the room. Once she grabbed it, Jordan blinked when she realized that she was missing an item that she needed to leave. She looked underneath one of the seat\\'s pillows before groaning quietly and closing her eyes. \"Oh no...I\\'m gone for a week and I forget where I put it. Great.\" she sighed to herself. Her eyes caught her desk, and she sighed again with relief. \"Oh, there it is.\" She walked over and picked up a thick textbook. Tyler walked in to say goodnight but stopped when he saw his daughter still dressed with her purse over her shoulder. \"Hi, honey. Where are you going?\" he asked. Jordan smiled. \"Hi, Daddy.\" She gave him a hug. \"Nick needs me to drop off his textbook. He left it in the library before we left last Friday.\" she rolled her eyes. \"That\\'s Nick for you.\" Tyler smirked. \"Don\\'t I know it.\" Jordan smirked back. Nick- or Nicholas- Kamrin was a guy in a few of Jordan\\'s courses that she tutored for part time. He was quite reckless. He fell asleep in class, procrastinated on his homework until the last minute, was a super flirt, snuck into places, and held the craziest parties. He was pretty well-known around campus. However, when his parents threatened to cut him off if his grades didn\\'t improve, of course he decided to buckle down (somewhat). He pleaded with the most intelligent girl in his class (Jordan Timberley McKessie) to help him understand the course content, and she agreed. She had been his tutor for a few months, and they got along fairly well, even though they were polar opposites. \"How long do you think it\\'ll take?\" Tyler asked. \"Well, apparently there\\'s some barbeque tonight at the boys\\' dorm? Trinity and Trish will be there and they want me to say hi before I go. It would depend on the length of our conversation. I\\'d say….an hour at most?\" Jordan guessed. \"Alright then.\" Tyler smiled. \"I know you\\'ll make good choices. Try to turn off the alarm quickly when you come in? I\\'m going to bed. Love you.\" \"Sure thing, Dad.\" Jordan nodded. \"Night, love you too.\" He held out his fist for a fist bump and Jordan accepted the gesture. Tyler went off to bed and Jordan went to the garage to take her car over to the university. XxxxxxxxX \"Kelsi, Luke, there\\'s a call for you in the office!\" Rose called downstairs to the siblings, who were watching television together. They paused their show and made their way to the upstairs office. When they got there, Luke and Kelsi smiled at the face they saw in the warm glow of the computer screen. \"Hi Dad.\" They greeted the man their mother had previously been video chatting with. \"Hey, you guys!\" Michael Nielsen smiled. \"How has everything been?\" \"Good!\" They answered in unison. Michael Nielsen and Julia Cross were in the military. The two were currently stationed overseas in Afghanistan and hadn\\'t seen their families in about a year. They both tried to call their families at least once a week. Monday was typically \\'call day\\' in the Nielsen-Cross home. In fact, at Evan and Jason\\'s house, Jason was currently speaking to his mother as well. Call day was the best way to begin the week. \"So, how do you guys want to do this? Do you want to take turns while you\\'re both in the room or just talk separately?\" He asked. Luke and Kelsi looked at each other. \"Do you want to talk separately?\" Luke asked his sister. \"I\\'d be fine with that.\" Kelsi nodded. \"Can I go first though? I have school in the morning.\" \"Sure.\" Luke nodded. He turned and gave Michael a single wave, \"I\\'ll see you in a little, Dad.\" \"Okay, see you soon.\" Michael said with a thumbs up. Once he left, Michael gave his daughter a smirk. \"First things first, kiddo.\" He said. \"Why did I see you hobble in here on crutches?\" \"Mom didn\\'t tell you?\" Kelsi blinked in surprise. \"Well, she told me that you injured yourself but I can\\'t remember the details. She said you broke your leg?\" He asked. \"I twisted my ankle, actually.\" Kelsi answered. \"It wasn\\'t fun.\" \"It doesn\\'t look fun.\" Michael replied. \"How did it happen?\" \"Logically, I fell down the bus stairs when I came home from camp.\" Kelsi explained. \"Illogically, I was a casualty of Troy\\'s birthday curse.\" \"Birthday curse?\" Her father raised an eyebrow. \"What birthday curse?\" \"Well, it was Troy\\'s birthday on the day we came home so the gang made him a birthday cupcake with a candle. When it was time for him to make a wish, he wished that from this year on out that we lead pleasant lives. However, he said the wish out loud. Everyone knows you don\\'t say your wishes out loud.\" Kelsi said with a playful sigh. \"Oh yeah, definitely.\" Michael agreed. \"So right after that, when I got off the bus, I coincidentally slipped and twisted my ankle. Some of the others think that the wish might have had something to do with it.\" Kelsi explained. \"Hm. That is a strange coincidence.\" Michael admitted. \"However, I don\\'t think there\\'s much to that theory. What about you?\" \"I don\\'t either.\" Kelsi laughed. \"Well that\\'s good.\" Michael laughed with her. \"So, besides your fall...how was camp?\" Kelsi gave her father a warm smile. \"It was awesome .\" XxxxxxxxX When Jordan entered the party house for the night (one of the campus Fraternity houses), she quickly felt overwhelmed by the amount of people attending. How would she find Nick to give him his book, or anyone she knew for that matter? Then she heard: \"Is that Jojo?!\" Jordan could hear the smile in the person\\'s voice before they- she - walked up. Her name was Trinity Clark, and like Jordan, she was also African American (although on the lighter side). Trinity was an absolute sweetheart and one of Jordan\\'s two closest friends. She and Jordan weren\\'t too different from one another in personality. Trinity was quieter (although she had her moments), slim, studious, had long dark brown hair, and was pretty responsible as well. \"Hey, you!\" Trinity laughed, giving Jordan a side hug. \"Come to return Nick\\'s book?\" \"Yep.\" Jordan smiled, holding it up. \"And only to give him the book back. Looking around, I don\\'t regret not ditching this party. It\\'s so loud.\" \"Right?\" Trinity agreed. \"It\\'s still fun though. I know parties were never your thing though, so I won\\'t stop you.\" \"Trinity, you\\'re kidding.\" The two girls turned to acknowledge the newcomer in the conversation, Patricia. Patricia- or Trish, was Jordan and Trinity\\'s other best friend. Trish was a curvy blonde who often wore her hair medium length hair in curls, a fishtail braid, or a high ponytail. Trish was the wild one in the group. She loved to live her life to the fullest and was always trying to get her friends to do the same. She took pride in being the fun one. \"What?\" Trinity smirked at her friend\\'s comment. \"You\\'re letting her get away?\" Trish whined playfully, placing her head on Trinity\\'s shoulder. \"She just got back from her New York trip.\" Trinity pointed out. \"Plus, we know these parties aren\\'t really her thing.\" \"Yeah, Trish.\" Nick said, walking up to them. \"You know Jordan\\'s not down for that kind of fun.\" He said with a teasing smirk. Jordan pointed at him and looked at Trish. \"He gets it.\" Trish sighed dramatically and rolled her eyes. Jordan passed Nicholas his missing item. \"Here\\'s your book, by the way.\" He sent her a charming smile. \"Thanks, doll.\" \"Mhm.\" She rolled her eyes at him playfully. He could be such a flirt. If Jordan was being honest with herself, she found him attractive. She would even admit that she had a small crush on him. They\\'d flirt every now and then, but nothing was serious. \"You sure you can\\'t stay awhile?\" Nick asked. \"Relax, dance, have a drink? Word going around is that this is going to be one of the best parties of the year.\" Before Jordan could respond, Trish spoke. \"She doesn\\'t care. Relaxing isn\\'t really her thing. She probably needs to get back home and file paperwork for daddy or something.\" Trish said. Jordan blinked at her, her previous smile changing to one of confusion, showing that she was slightly offended. \"What does that mean?\" \"Well...just that. I mean...don\\'t you like, live for that company?\" She replied with slight hesitation. \"I don\\'t, actually.\" Jordan replied with a sarcastic smile. \"I didn\\'t mean it like that.\" Trish began. \"Jordan, what Trish is trying to say it that parties were never really your thing.\" Trinity spoke up. \"And that\\'s okay!\" She quickly added. \"It\\'s just-\" \"You never did anything fun in high school.\" Trish mumbled. \"It was always school and McKessie Enterprises for you. You didn\\'t do parties or go out with anyone much. You only hung out with us. Even then, you were always Miss. Perfect little schoolgirl.\" \"You really seem to want to turn this conversation into a fight Patricia.\" Smiling Trinity sang under her breath. \"It\\'s true?\" Trish defended herself. \"No offense JJ, I\\'m not trying to call you out or anything, it\\'s just that you\\'re….kind of socially dead.\" \" Socially dead .\" Jordan repeated in mock awe. Trinity groaned quietly at Trish as Jordan spoke, putting her head in her hand. \"Wait, no, not socially dead-\" Trish began. \"No no, it\\'s fine. You know what? I am kind of stressed from the trip.\" Jordan lightly tapped Nick. \"Nick, I think I will have a drink. Could you grab me one?\" \"Coming right up.\" He grinned, walking to the kitchen to retrieve it. \"Thank you.\" She smiled. Trinity crossed her arms. \"Jordan, you wouldn\\'t.\" \"I just did.\" Jordan replied. \"She\\'s going to drink that one beer, and head home.\" Trish said to Trinity. \"We\\'re lucky if she stays here to drink it.\" Nick came back at that moment and handed Jordan her drink. \"Then it must be your lucky day.\" Jordan smirked and took a swig. Trish didn\\'t seem to believe her. \"I bet you twenty- no- fifty dollars that you\\'ll chicken out and go home within two hours.\" Jordan held out her hand, her smirk never leaving her face. \"You have yourself a deal.\" They shook hands. \"Alright then.\" Trish smirked. \"Let\\'s party McKessie.\" Nick and Trinity cheered. Jordan laughed and they went to continue participating in the party. XxxxxxxxX \"You\\'re up.\" Kelsi told Luke with a smile as she left the home\\'s office. \"Thanks.\" Luke said, giving her a fist bump. \"Night Kel.\" \"Night Lukey.\" She sang, walking down the hall to her bedroom. Luke walked into the office and took his seat in front of the computer. \"Hey.\" He greeted Michael with a smile. \"Hey.\" Michael smiled back. \"How was your week?\" \"Good.\" Luke replied, nodding his head. \"I was kinda busy with a project so it flew by kind of quickly.\" \"I heard.\" Michael nodded with an arch of his eyebrow. \"Big project?\" \"Medium sized project, big work.\" Luke clarified. \"Hm….okay.\" His father nodded. \"You think McKessie will go for it?\" \"I think he\\'ll love it.\" Luke grinned. \"I can\\'t wait to show him.\" \"That\\'s great!\" Michael nodded. \"Now, Luke.\" He began seriously, \"You know that you don\\'t need to impress him, right?\" \"Yeah, of course.\" Luke nodded quickly. \"Okay...because your mother tells me that you didn\\'t notice her come in this evening.\" Michael continued. \"I just want to make sure you\\'re not hyperfocusing on it.\" \"I\\'m not, I promise.\" Luke smiled. \"Okay then.\" Michael returned it. \"That\\'s all I needed to know.\" Luke nodded. \"Anyway, how was your week?\" He asked. \"Great.\" Michael said cheerfully. \"Not nearly as busy as the last. I miss you guys though.\" \"When are you coming home? Luke asked. \"Eh...a few more months.\" Michael responded, rubbing the back of his neck. \"I\\'ll have to check up on that. I\\'ll let you know as soon as I can.\" \"Okay.\" Luke nodded. \"How\\'s Aunt Julia?\" \"She\\'s good. Still on the phone with Jason.\" He chuckled. \"I think she missed the call last time due to being summoned.\" \"Ah, I see. That makes sense.\" Luke chuckled. \"Well, it\\'s time for me to turn in.\" Michael sighed. \"I\\'m sorry our time was kind of short...was there anything else you wanted to discuss? Your project maybe?\" \"I think I\\'m good.\" Luke said. \"I can update you next week after I tweak a few things?\" \"Sure! That sounds great.\" Michael nodded and smiled at his son. \"Can\\'t wait to hear about it.\" \"Awesome.\" Luke grinned. \"Okay, night dad.\" \"Night son.\" Michael replied. \"Oh! Luke?\" He called softly before Luke hung up. \"Yes sir?\" Luke looked up at him. \"Remember, you\\'re an amazing young man.\" He said. Luke smiled. \"I know. Thanks, Dad.\" XxxxxxxxX About three hours later, it was 1 in the morning. The party was coming to a close and people were starting to head home. Jordan and Nick however, sat by the pool in the back of the frat house talking. At the moment, they were calming themselves down after laughing at a story that Jordan had told. \"So, what made you decide to be the owner of McKessie Enterprises?\" Nick questioned. \"Hm…\" Jordan hummed, taking yet another sip of her drink from the red solo cup she held. This time, she was having a strawberry vodka. Jordan liked fruitier drinks as opposed to the more bitter ones. She felt light-hearted and warm (perhaps even a bit sleepy). \"Well, when I was little, about five I believe, my parents and I were outside of the company building in New York one afternoon. My mom had brought me with her to have lunch with my dad before he had another meeting. We kind of had a picnic on one of the benches. He was telling me how he thought I would like the next client because she had invented a digital toybox. It was like a dispenser of sorts. A child could program their toys into it, drop it in the box, and when they wanted it again, they could press a few buttons on an interactive screen and boom ! There it was. I of course, wanted to see this immediately .\" \"Of course.\" Nick said with wide eyes and a nod. \"That sounds awesome!\" \"It was!\" She nodded in agreement. \"It was set up like a library on the inside. Different sides had different sizes...it seemed so complex yet so simple . In the pictures that my dad showed me, it looked like a regular toy box. Well, a toy box with programming similar to a scanner, at least I couldn\\'t wait to see it. So my dad said that he would take me with him after lunch to see how it worked. The creator- I think her name was started with a P….anyway, she was lovely. Her invention was fantastic and I was just...floored. The fact that she had imagined something and brought it to life to share with the world left me in awe. I then realized that my dad did the same thing. That was his business. Although, he usually looked over the inventions and worked with their inventors to perfect and eventually market them.\" \"That\\'s pretty cool.\" Nick admitted. \"He offered to teach me on the way home since I wouldn\\'t stop talking about it. It\\'s been my dream ever since.\" She smiled at him. \"That\\'s a pretty cool story.\" Nick commented. \"Did you ever have other dreams?\" He asked. Jordan shook her head, her dark brown curls swishing with the motion. \"No.\" She replied. \"What?\" Nick said in disbelief. \"Come on. You\\'re joking.\" \"I\\'m not!\" Jordan laughed with another head shake. \"Not one dream.\" Nick repeated. Another head shake. \"Okay well, I had other dreams. For example, when I was in first grade, I told my teacher that I wanted to be the ice cream man.\" \"The ice cream man.\" Jordan repeated, her brown eyes lighting up with amusement. \"Yep. I had zero understanding of profit back then and I thought that I would just have a jolly old time eating the ice cream out of my truck for free.\" Nick chuckled at the memory. \"That sounds...unhealthy.\" Jordan commented with a giggle. \"Right?\" Nick grinned. \"But it was my first dream. Didn\\'t you tell your kindergarten or first grade teacher what you wanted to be? Like an astronaut? Or a doctor?\" \"Of course I did. Everyone does.\" Jordan smirked. \"Okay, so what did you answer for that?\" Nick asked. Jordan smiled, looking at the water. \"When I was in first grade, I told my teacher that when I grew up, I was going to be the next CEO of McKessie Enterprises. One of the boys in my class said that I couldn\\'t own a company because I was a girl. I responded that I could and that I would because A.) I was much smarter than him, so I knew I would have the skills to qualify, and B.) because my daddy owned the company and he promised that he would train me for the position. I was a total ladyboss.\" \"Wow.\" Nick commented, laughing at her reasons. \"You told him.\" \"Uh-huh.\" She said sassily. The two sat in peaceful silence for a moment after their laughter died down. After a moment, Nick spoke again. \"Notice how you said \\'was going\\' instead of \\'wanted\\'.\" He suddenly pointed out, taking a swig of his beer. Jordan tensed slightly. \"Does that matter?\" \"Kind of, yeah.\" Nick nodded, turning his head to look at her. \"Because even then, you just went with your first dream. You never explored anything else.\" \"Why would I need to?\" Jordan asked. \"I don\\'t know. I just feel like you should have had a solid reason to choose that as your destiny.\" Nick replied. \"I mean, yeah, you liked the toy box. Who wouldn\\'t? That sounds sick. But...to choose your career goal off of it from such a young age?\" \"It was what I decided to do.\" Jordan said, frowning slightly and looking at the pool again as she took another sip of her vodka. \"Yeah, but was it all your decision?\" Nick asked. \"Yes.\" Jordan deadpanned, turning to look Nick in his eyes. \"Okay...now tell me why.\" Nick said. Jordan scoffed. \"I...It just was!\" She laughed in disbelief. \"That\\'s not a defendable reason!\" Nick pointed at her with a smile. \"It\\'s reason enough for me.\" Jordan shook her head. \"Are you sure about that?\" Nick asked. Jordan opened her mouth the say \\'yes\\' but she...couldn\\'t. Well, didn\\'t. \"You\\'re not sure, are you?\" Nick stated more than asked. \"Well, this is college. Before you graduate with a degree in business and a minor in mechanical engineering, I think the time to decide on a change would be now. What do you want, Jordan?\" Before Jordan could answer, the patio door opened and Trish came over stand to beside the two students. \"Well Jo…I stand corrected.\" She said, pulling a $50 bill out of her pocket and handing it to Jordan. \"You stayed and partied for over two hours. I\\'m impressed.\" \"Oh!\" Jordan blinked, taking it from her. \"Thanks, T. I forgot we even made that bet.\" She admitted with a laugh. \"I did too for a moment.\" Trish confessed, laughing as well. \"I had fun with you tonight. I wish we could do it more often.\" \"Yeah, you\\'re pretty cool outside of class. \" Nick smiled. \"I\\'m cool in class too?\" She teased. \"Eh, I like you more out here.\" Nick teased back. \"I agree with Trish. I\\'d like to see you around more often. You should swing by again.\" Jordan looked down at her prize, blushing ever so slightly. \"Maybe I will.\" She decided. \"I had fun too.\" Trish grinned. \"Really?\" \"When\\'s the next one?\" Jordan smiled back. \"My place, next Wednesday at 8?\" She offered. \"I was gonna offer the movies this Friday.\" Nick raised his hand. \"They have thriller night at 7 that evening.\" \"Let\\'s do both.\" Jordan shrugged. Nick and Trish grinned. \"Awesome!\" they cheered. \"I\\'ll let Trin know.\" Trish smiled. \"Need a ride home?\" \"Whoa. None of you should be driving.\" Nick pointed at her with a serious look. \"Also, I drove, remember?\" Jordan added in. \"Oh yeah...\" Trish whispered, looking off. \"Let\\'s just go back to your dorm then.\" Jordan offered. \"I\\'ll text my mom, \\'cause I\\'m not going home like this. I\\'ll just say that we had a movie night. We\\'ll tell Trinity the plan on the way there.\" She stood up. \"Alright.\" Trish nodded. \"Thanks for inviting us, Nick. See you Friday.\" She waved. \"Thanks for coming.\" He smiled as they began to go inside. \"Hey, Kess?\" Jordan turned around before she could enter the glass door. \"Hm?\" She hummed in response. \"Think about what I said.\" He said. Jordan nodded. \"Okay. Have a nice night, Nick.\" She waved. He saluted her back in response before she went inside. As she made her way to the front door, Jordan sent her mother a text on her whereabouts. To Diana McKessie (Mom 3): Had a movie night with the girls. Trinity insisted that we watch Harry Potter again, so I\\'m staying in their dorm tonight. I\\'ll be home after classes tomorrow before movie night. Love you, night mama 3 After the text sent, Jordan flipped her phone shut and sighed. She needed to get some sleep. \"Ready to go?\" She heard Trish say. Jordan turned and smiled at a yawning Trinity beside her. \"Yeah, let\\'s go.\" Well, that was a look into the characters nightly activities and subplots. ^^ Thanks for reading my nightly activities after a long week of college lol. Feel free to comment below, it would make my day. Or...night. Lol. Also, here\\'s a Fun Fact: Nick\\'s first dream to be the ice cream man? That was my first dream. I wanted to be the ice cream man and get free ice cream every day. Lol, thanks for reading everyone!']","Summary":" [\"Welcome to the series, 16andUp! I've had this in my head for quite a while and have been working"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"After It All","Author":"EllaBean","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980951","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['It had been three days since their graduation, and Gabriella was blissfully happy. She was driving back to Stanford, but this time Troy was in the seat next to her, driving. She felt so different this time. last time all she felt was dread, but this time she knew that she and Troy could actually stay together. they could be each other\\'s rocks, and everything would be perfect. Eventually, with happy thoughts I mind, she drifted off to sleep. (Troy\\'s POV) I was driving my old, white pickup truck, and I saw Gabriella with a smile on her face and my heart gave a little flutter. Her beautiful brown curls were blowing in the wind. All I could think about was how lucky I felt. This beautiful girl, who was kind, gentle, talented, and everything anyone could ever want. I had to force myself to keep my eyes on the road. After a while, I realized that she had fallen asleep as she curled up in a ball with her breathing steady and her eyes closed. Even when she was asleep she was beautiful. By the time we arrived at her dorm she was still asleep, but she had shifted so that she had her hands closed around my arm, and her head was on my shoulder. I wanted to just stay like this forever. Her body melded perfectly into mine. After debating for a bit on whether or not to wake her up I decided to wake her up. She slowly stirred and let out a small mewing sound, which made me laugh. \"Troy? Are we here already? I am so sorry that I fell asleep on you!\" She exclaimed. I only laughed and replied, \"It is completely fine, you look like you needed the rest, and to answer your question we are back at your dorm.\" \"Ohh. Is it terrible that all I want to do is just stay with you?\" she said with a sigh. \"I do too, but I will see you tomorrow! You promised me that you would help me unpack and get my dorm ready.\" \"At least we have that.\" She then moved to turn away, but quickly gave me a kiss on the cheek. \"Is that all?\" I asked with a mischievous smile. \"If you don\\'t smile like that I might give you a proper kiss.\" She replied. I immediately became completely solemn. She only laughed that beautiful laugh that I loved with all my heart. She then gave me a quick peck on the lips, hopped out of the car, ran into her dorm building, and blew me a kiss. Of course, I cheesily caught it and blew one back at her. She just giggled and was then out of sight. I sighed and drove away with a smile on my face, feeling wonderfully happy. Next Morning... I woke up the next morning to the sound of the opening of my door. The next thing I knew Troy had walked in, bearing coffee and my favorite donut, double chocolate. \"Hello, sleepyhead,\" he said kissing me on the forehead. I yawned as I slowly got up. \"Aww, you take such good care of me,\"I said happily. I love him so much! Ever since my dad died I was loved by my mom, but I always wanted to feel the love of a guy, and Troy took care of me when I was at my worst and best. \"Thank you for getting breakfast!\" \"No problem. I am going to make you my worker for the next couple hours. I am just ensuring maximum work capacity.\" He and I just looked at each other and laughed. \"So,\" he started again,\"This is your dorm. It is more like a suite!\" \"Since I was a part of the special honors program I have a dorm that I only have to share with another one of the honors candidates. So far she seems really nice and smart. She is majoring in law also! We are going to study together!\" \"Well, it seems like you will be well taken care of here. I haven\\'t seen my dorm yet. I just stayed in a motel last night, because I didn\\'t feel like driving anymore.\" \"You should have told me!\" I said. \"You could have stayed here on the couch!\" \"Gabi, don\\'t worry. I have managed to sleep on the floor in Chads room. Anything is better than that.\" he shuddered at the thought. I only laughed. We sat and ate for a little bit longer then we got on the road. It was only about a half an hour drive to Troy\\'s dorm, and then we parked the car and went dorm was a pretty small, average dorm size. It had two bunk beds and a small bathroom off to the side. \"Well, here is my new home!\" he said with a smile, \"the college said that I was put in a dorm with a fellow basketball player, so it should be interesting.\" Just then a tall, olive-skinned guy walked in. He had brown hair, hazel eyes, and a mischevious smile. He then walked up to troy and started talking. \"Well, you must be my new roommate! My name is Daniel Whister, but people usually call me Danny or DW.\" \"My name is Troy Bolton, and this is Gabriella.\" With a little smirk, Danny came up to me and started flirting, or at least his attempt at it. \"Hello, hot cakes. You can call me Danny.\" Troy immediately pulled him away by his shirt and said to Danny, \"This is my girlfriend who you will never hit on again.\" Danny just laughed and said, \"Don\\'t worry bro. I was just seeing if it was an awkward, best friends that like each other or something that was legit.\" \"What about just asking?\" Troy said. \"I could have done that, but if you guys were just best friends, then it would have created more of an awkward situation.\" \"Well,\" I decided to interject now,\"Now that we have had our first meeting, would you be willing to help get some of Troy\\'s stuff out of the car?\" \"Sure thing! Are you going here too?\" \"No, I am going to Stanford, law.\" \"Wow. Troy, you got yourself a keeper here. Smart and beautiful!\" \"Don\\'t I know it.\" Troy said then put his arm around me and said, \"Let\\'s get to it!\"'][Chapter 2] ['Chapter 2(Troys pov) By the time we had finished unloading everything from my car, it was lunchtime, and the three of us decided to go to the university cafeteria to eat and get to know Danny better. So far I wasn\\'t sure what to think of him. He seemed nice, but like a bit of a player. I don\\'t think he meant any harm by flirting with Gabriella. I think he genuinely was curious. AS we talked over lunch, I started asking questions about where he was from, and what brought him to the University of California. It was interesting walking around the university campus. It felt really cool to be just a college student. Free to do whatever I wanted. I was also excited to meet new friends. We finally got to the cafeteria and got our food. the cafeteria alone was huge and there were many different options for food, however, it tasted a step above gas station food. We all then sat down and started eating and talking. \"So Danny,\" Gabby asked,\"when did you get to campus?\" \"I got here a week ago for summer classes. I had decided to take 1 of the classes that I would have taken during basketball season so that I would not be overwhelmed by it.\" \"That is really cool! What are you majoring in?\" Gabriella questioned. \"I have always wanted to be an engineer. Of course, I love basketball, but I am not good enough to make it to the pros.\" \"Well, an engineer is a really good career. I wish you the best of luck.\" Gabriella said,\"I am going to get some more lemonade.\" \"Do you want me to come with you?\" I asked. \"Don\\'t worry, Troy. I will be just fine.\" She said with a smile. She then got up and walked over to the dink dispenser. While she was gone, Danny and I got caught up in a conversation about basketball. it turns out that he had picked up basketball as a hobby in 8th grade and was pretty good at it, so he tried out for the high school team, and had been playing ever since. It was really interesting to learn about him a little more. He told me about his family, and how he was the oldest of three, and he had two sisters, and I told him about me. After about five minutes, I realized that Gabriella still had not come back, so Danny and I decided to clean up and look for her. I realized that I was probably being overprotective, but I couldn\\'t shake the uneasy feeling. After Danny and I had looked all around the food court, we decided to split up. he would stay at our table in case she just had gone to the bathroom, and I went outside to call her and see where she was. I called her, and she didn\\'t pick up. i tried again, and after a few rings she picked up. \"Troy?\" She sounded a little muffled, and her voice was a little shaky. \"Gabriella, honey, where are you?\" \"Troy, could you come to the family bathrooms over by the drinking fountains.\" \"Of course, but why..\" she had already hung up. I quickly walked to the bathroom and then knocked on the door. \"Honey? Are you in there.\"I asked. \"Hey, Troy. Could you pass me your sweatshirt?\" I did so, and then she came out, wearing it. \"What happened!? I was so worried,\" I said to her. \"I was refilling my cup, and then some tall blond guy, who I think was a football player came up to me, and started talking to me. At first, I thought he was being friendly, but then he invited me to his dorm and started making inappropriate suggestions. I told him that I had a boyfriend, but he thought I was playing hard to get. He then tried to touch me and I started walking away. He then grabbed my arm, and I pulled it away. At this point, we were right by here, and I moved to get inside the bathroom, but he grabbed my shirt, and it ripped. I immediately ran into the bathroom. Just after that, you called me. I am not sure where he is now.\" she said all this calmly. I, however, was livid. How many times had something like this happened when I wasn\\'t around. My mind was spinning. All that I could think to do was pull her close to me, and hug her, not letting her go. Eventually, we started to walk back to Danny, and we talked. She seemed completely calm about the situation, and I could only think of how lucky I was to have such a beautiful, strong girlfriend. \"We will talk about his more later,\" I whispered in her ear. \"Ok. Just please don\\'t tell anyone. At least until we can talk more about it.\" \"Whatever you want,\"I said.'][Chapter 3] ['I will give you a warning. This chapter is pure fluff. If you dont like that kind of stuff it might not be for you. Chapter 3 Troy and Gabriella walked back to Danny and did their best to act nonchalant, and if Danny was suspicious he did not let it on. They finished their lunch and headed back to the dorm. Troy was still very concerned but was doing his best to remain calm for Gabriella\\'s sake. After they completed moving Troy into his dorm Troy and Gabriella said goodbye to Danny, and then they stopped by In-N-Out burger, and Troy dropped Gabriella off at her dorm, but as she turned to walk away, Troy grabbed her hand. \"Gabby? Are you sure you are alright? I can\\'t help but think that if I had only been there to protect you, this never would have happened. He would never have touched you.\" \"Troy. You couldn\\'t have known. We both have never been to college before. It is a whole new world now. We arent in East High anymore, but I think that it is important for situations like this to happen so that we can learn how to deal with something like this as adults. It is important to have something happen in every relationship so that we can learn how to work together in hard times as well as in good times.\" Troy still looked worried, unconvinced, and guilty, but he dropped Gabriella\\'s hand and said a reluctant goodnight. Gabriella looked like she was about to say something, but before she could continue Troy drove away. She watched as the car drove away, and she felt sad, but not from the guy that was flirting with her that afternoon. She felt strangely unaffected from that. She was unnerved at first, but she had already been teased in her previous schools, and flirting vs. teasing felt surprisingly similar. The only thing that worried her was how Troy was feeling and was trying to think of ways to show him how unaffected she truly was. Next Morning... Troy got up early the next morning. It was Sunday, and basketball practice did not start until Monday. He wanted to talk to Gabriella, but how could he look her in the eye, and pretend that he wasn\\'t affected by the fact that he couldn\\'t protect her. If it was in High School then it would be easy for him to deal with this, but the fact that he wasn\\'t known now made it so hard. He was in a new environment where he didn\\'t have any influence or sway. If he was still in high school he could at least talk to the teachers or deal with the jerk himself. Now he was the underdog. In a new place, he had never known and didn\\'t have many friends either. A buzzing noise then startled him from his thoughts. He looked over and saw a text on his phone from Gabriella. \"Hey, handsome:) Do you want to go get lunch later. It would be nice to talk about what happened yesterday. I\\'ll meet you at Blaze in between our dorms. xoxo\" After thinking for a while Troy decided to go and talk with her. He needed to learn that he wasn\\'t going to be around all the time and that he should trust her to take care of herself. If she got hurt of course he would blame himself, but he would be there no matter what to pick up the pieces. If she needed him he would come. He still had a couple hours until he neede to meet her, so he decided to pick up his guitar and sing which always helped him clear his head. He hadn\\'t been playing guitar for long, but it was like an outlet that he didn\\'t know that he had been missing his whole life. He then started playing and eventually wrote a chorus for a song. Wherever you go Know that you\\'re never alone you\\'re forever in my heart And the moments you need me No distance could keep me I will be wherever you are You could be all the way across the ocean You might just feel a million miles from me It don\\'t matter baby I\\'ll come running, oh I will do anything to make you see Wherever you go Know that you\\'re never alone you\\'re forever in my heart And the moments you need me No distance could keep me I will be wherever you are And you find pain when you fall down and you hit harder times Just call my name, I\\'ll always be right by your side He had never written a song before, and he knew he would never share them with others (except maybe Gabriella), but now he felt complete calm wash over him, and he knew that while protecting someone every minute of every day is impossible, being there when they need help is possible and is almost all you can do. So he put his guitar, stood up and walked o the door to go meet Gabriella. When Troy got to Blaze, he realized that he was late, but then he saw Gabriella and his heart stopped. She was just sitting at a table but looked so beautiful, and he realized then that one day no matter what he would make her his wife. When he got closer to her he realized that she was crying, and she looked so depressed. He realized that he had made her cry. She was worried. He had hurt his sweet darling, Gabriella. He walked up to her and she immediately brightened. She ran over to him and threw her arms around him and then gave him a kiss. \"I thought you weren\\'t coming.\" \"I will always be there for you. No matter what. Even if we fight nothing can keep me away from you.\" He responded with such sincerity that her eyes watered. \"I love you, Troy.\" \"I love you too. Forever and ever no matter what.\" After they finished eating Troy said,\"Let\\'s go to the park. I have something I want to show you.\" When they got there Troy got out his guitar and sang her his song. \"Gabriella. I wrote this song this morning, but I feel like I started writing this song when I first met you. I couldn\\'t think of any other way that would show you how much I love you and care for you. If you ever need me, I will come running. I will always be yours. I am sorry that I was not myself last night. I realize that I was cold. I was blaming myself that I couldn\\'t protect you, but there is no way that we can work if I don\\'t trust you enough to take care of yourself. I will take care of you when you need me, but I realize now that all I can do is protect you when I can, and let your own decision, and I will always be around to pick up the pieces if you get hurt. I love you.\" At that point Gabriella was speechless, and her only response was to kiss him and show him her love that she could not express through words. The song I used in this chapter was called:\"Wherever you are\" by Ben Rector. Check it out, though I will warn you that it is meant to be about a dad and daughter, I thought bits of it would be appropriate for this chapter. I hope you enjoyed reading this!'][Chapter 4] ['Chapter 4 (Troys pov) Gabriella and I spent the rest of the day together, just laughing and talking. It was good for us just to have a relaxed day, and not feel any pressure to be somewhere or worry about anything. It was comforting to know that even though college would be tough, we could still go out on a normal date and just forget about everything. After spending the day together we both realized that we needed to get back to our dorms, because Gabby had classes tomorrow, and I had basketball prep. For normal schools, basketball practices wouldn\\'t start so far in advance, but this was a Big Ten school, and it was serious if we weren\\'t at our A game. So I dropped Gabby off at her dorm, and we kissed goodnight. Then Gabby pulled away, and she whispered in my ear: \"Goodnight Wildcat.\" And with that, she ran inside. I sat in the car staring after her for a minute. How lucky am I that I have her? She is beautiful, smart, and everything I ever wanted. I love her so much. Eventually, I pulled away even though I could still feel the ghost of her lips on mine, and I could taste her cinnamon gum. I started the 40-minute drive back to Berkeley. Eventually, I arrived back at my dorm and crept in, careful not to wake Danny. I quickly pulled on pajama pants and climbed into my bunk. Within seconds I was fast asleep. Next morning... I woke up and heard a buzzing. I looked over at my phone and saw that Gabriella had texted me. \"Good morning, Wildcat! I hope basketball practice goes well! Love you xoxo\" I smiled and again thought how lucky I was. It was 6 am, and basketball started at 7. I slowly rolled out of bed, and then got ready for practice. By the time I had made my bed, brushed my teeth, and packed for practice I had 15 minutes to be there, so I grabbed my key and headed out the door. By the time I got to the gym, I had 5 minutes until practice started, so I decided to warm up and do some free throws. After practicing for a couple minutes, the coach walked in, and the team got started on practice. By the end of practice, I realized that it was going to be a lot of hard work, but I think I kept up with the others pretty well, but I would be sore for a week from this practice alone. I slowly walked to the cafeteria to get some breakfast, and then I felt my phone ring. It was Gabriella. \"Hi, Sweetheart,\" I answered. \"Troy, are you alright? You sound exhausted. did the coach work you that hard? Don\\'t...\" \"Gabby. I am fine. It was just a good workout. By the way, I think it is cute that you are worried about me.\" \"I will always worry about you. That is my job as your girlfriend.\" \"And I love you for it.\" She always was so sweet about me taking care of myself. \"Anyway. How was practice?\" \"It was good. I think I was able to keep up with everybody, which I was a little worried about. I am really liking Danny, too. He is a solid basketball player, and he seems like a really great guy. We will see how we do living together.\" \"Well, I am glad that you are feeling good about it. I just was wanting to check in and make sure that you were doing alright.\" \"I am. What about you? How was your first class?\" \"It was okay. The teacher was really interesting, but I feel like some of the students aren\\'t very invested in the class.\" \"Well, if they are okay wasting this opportunity, then that is their choice. You shouldn\\'t worry about them.\" \"Thanks. Listen, I have to go. My next class starts soon. I love you, Troy!\" \"I love you too, Babe. Have a great day!\" \"Bye!\" \"See ya!\" After we hung up, I resumed in my quest for breakfast, and then I saw Danny sitting at a table, so after I got my food, I walked up to him. Of course being Danny he greeted me with a: \"You must have just talked to Gabriella to have such a dorky smile on your face.\" \"I did in fact, and you wish that you had a girlfriend as amazing as her.\" \"Indeed I do, but not all of us can be as lucky as you.\" After that, we both just laughed, and we continued eating. We just talked and laughed. I was really starting to like him. If you put aside his bad-boy facade, then he was a great guy who loved basketball and his sisters. He couldn\\'t stop talking about them. He said that his mom was young when she had him, and his dad had abused him and her. After a couple years he went to the hospital for a check-up, and they figured out that both he and his mom were both abused. After that, they called protective services. His dad was put in prison for 10 years, and they lived on their own. When Danny was 10, his mom met a professor, and they fell in love. The professor, whose name was John, became like a father to Danny, and they were very close. When Danny was 15, his mom became pregnant again (she was 35). 9 months later twin girls were born. they were named Emma and Annie. Danny loved his little sisters. They were now 3. The only reason Danny, himself was able to come to the college was because he received a government scholarship. When Danny finished telling Troy this, all that Troy could think of was how hard Danny must have worked so hard to get here. Thank you for reading! I realize that Berkeley is not a Big Ten school, but it works with the story, so C\\'est la vie. What is the purpose of fanfiction, but to have fun, and not necessarily have to make things factually accurate?'][Chapter 5] ['This chapter is a bit more serious. One thing that I feel like we miss out on in High School Musical are explanations of where Gabriella\\'s Dad is. I just wanted to give a little more background on Gabriella\\'s past. If you are worried that I will make them all this sad, then don\\'t. It will be happy and fun for the next couple chapters. Chapter 5 (Gabriella\\'s POV) It had been a week since Troy had started Basketball practice, and it seemed like he enjoyed it, though I could tell he was sore even though he was trying to hide it from me. He always thinks that being tough is what he needs to do for me, but I would rather have him show me his weakness so that I could be strong for him every once in a while, but I love him and his foolish man pride all the same. I am really enjoying my law classes. One class that I am taking is particularly interesting. It is discussing how to view cases objectively to discover the complete and total truth in criminal cases. One philosophy that they believe strongly in at this college is that, unless you know the truth about your case, it will be hard to defend it whether it be a conviction of your client not. It all fascinated me. Defending those who always were immediately assumed to be guilty. Of course, some are guilty of the accused crime, others are not, but in law, you have to believe in innocent until proven guilty. It gave me shivers of delight just thinking about defending a person who had been ramed for a ghastly crime that they did not do, but no one else would believe them, and I would singlehandedly save them from a life in prison. I could really make a difference in some lives. I could provide resolution to families that would otherwise have none. When I was little, my father was killed in a shooting incident in a school. He had been a teacher at a good school, and one day a shooter came in. My dad then took a bullet for students and saved their lives. Most of me felt proud of him, but the selfish part of me felt angry. Why would my dad threw himself in front of a gun when he knew that I would be waiting for him at the window at home like I always did? Why would he sacrifice the chance to see me again? If he really loved me, why would he do this? These questions had plagued me frequently since that day. Lately, I had been more at peace since I had Troy, but tomorrow is the anniversary of his death, and I couldn\\'t stop thinking about it. I finished the classes for the day, and then went to the library to study, and finish the assignments due. Technically they weren\\'t due until next week, but I always play safe. I finished up at the library, went to the cafeteria, and then went back to my dorm. I had just finished taking a shower when Troy called. \"Hey Beautiful,\" he started. \"Hello, Wildcat! How was your day?\" \"It was great! Coach pulled me aside today and said that he wants me to be a starter! He also said that he was impressed by my team spirit, and would have made me a captain if I weren\\'t a freshman because it wouldn\\'t be fair to the upperclassmen! Still! I am so excited that I have been able to catch the coaches attention!\" \"That is amazing, Troy! I am so proud of you, though I knew you would be amazing!\" \"Thanks, Babe. I was also calling to see if you wanted to go out to dinner with me tomorrow night?\" My face turned white at the thought. I still hadn\\'t told Troy about my dad. He knew that my dad had died, but didn\\'t know how. I also hadn\\'t told him about my doubts, and feelings on the matter, but if I told him no he would either be hurt or suspicious or both. \"I would love to!\" I said, inwardly knowing that tomorrow was going to be a long day. Tomorrow Night... Troy picked me up in his car, and we started driving. \"Where do you want to go tonight?\" He asked me. \"Ummm. I am not sure. Maybe someplace casual? I don\\'t really feel like going someplace fancy. I just want to be with you.\" \"Exactly what I was thinking, Sweetheart.\" We then fell silent, and I became lost in my thoughts. After a while, Troy started to speak. \"Gabby, are you okay? You seem so sad.\" \"I\\'m fine, Troy.\" He looked unconvinced. \"Really, Troy? I am fine.\" \"Honey, I am just worried about you.\" I settled into my thoughts again, and then I just blurted out: \"My dad died 10 years ago.\" Troy pulled over. \"Gabby, why didn\\'t you tell me earlier?\" \"Because I have been trying to forget.\" \"What happened?\" \"There was a school shooting. My dad stepped in front of a gun to save a student. Part of me has been angry all these years. I was waiting at the door at home like I did every day, and then someone knocked on the door. My mom told me to go into the kitchen, and then I heard her start to sob. I ran into the living room, and an officer came up to me, and I started questioning him. My Dad\\'s best friend then came up to me and said that Daddy wasn\\'t going to come home again. He told me that Daddy wanted me to know that he loved me. I can\\'t remember much else that night. I just remember numbness. He always called me his princess. I just remember thinking that I would never be his princess again.\" By this time I hadn\\'t realized that I was crying until Troy reached over and wiped the tears from my face. \"Why would he take the bullet, when he knew I was waiting at home?\" I sobbed. Troy just brought me over into his lap and hugged me. \"I am so sorry you were going through this alone, baby. What was he like?\" \"He was really tall. When my friends met him they were a little scared, but he was so smart and kind. He used to boast saying that I as the most hugged 8 year old in the world. When I was really little we would watch Disney channel every Saturday morning, and I would put my head on his chest. He said he would always be there for me. He was reading Lord of the Rings to me when he died. Every night when he came home, I would wait by the window, and then I would pounce on him as soon as he walked in.\" \"He sounds wonderful, sweetie.\" \"You remind me of him. Protective, fiercely loyal, and your eyes are the same color as his.\" \"I consider that a great compliment.\" After a while Gabriella calmed down, and just sat on Troy\\'s lap, hugging him. \"Thank you, Troy. For listening.\" \"Anytime, anywhere, I will be there for you.\" Thank you so much for reading!'][Chapter 6] ['Chapter 6 Gabriella\\'s POV Now that I had told Troy about my dad I had felt so calm about the matter with my dad, and the next few weeks after that day I finally was at peace and could look back on the memories with my dad with joy and love instead of bitterness and anger. Ans so, weeks passed, and soon it was time for the official start of the university year. The whole summer troy and I had been working hard, and now it was technically just getting started. Troy and I tried to hang out when we could, but it was hard since we were both full-time students, and Troy had basketball. He and I, however, were better than ever. We talked every day, and we told each other everything. Before we knew it we had already completed the first 2 months of school. This Friday Troy and I will also be going to his college\\'s football game. Even though we go to different universities, we still enjoy hanging out at university events. Friday Night... (NO one\\'s POV) Gabriella got ready in her dorm for the game that night and put on a blue shirt to cheer for Berkeley. After a while, she heard Troy\\'s car pull up, and she ran out and hopped in, giving him a kiss. \"How are you, Wildcat?\" she said with a smile. \"I am so much better now that you are here with me,\" he paused,\" That was really cheesy, wasn\\'t it?\" Gabriella giggled and nodded. \"Oh well, it is true. My day became 10 times better now that I have seen you.\" \"Well, my day got better just seeing you, too!\" She said and gave him a kiss. He smiled and hugged her. \"Well, we should probably get going if we want to get to the game on time,\" Gabriella pointed out. \"True.\" And so they started driving. (TRoy\\'s POV) We arrived at the stadium 15 minutes before the game started, and we got to our seats right before it started. The stadium was an array of blue and gold occasionally speckled with the crimson and gray of Washington state. It was really interesting, and at one point Gabriella and I were put on the big screen. The game was great, and nothing went wrong until the game ended. Berkeley won and Gabriella and I were walking back to my car. Since we both hadn\\'t eaten dinner, we decided to go to a nearby diner that is the students\\' favorite place to hang out. We then ordered some food and we soon became lost in conversation. After a little while, a large group of students came in, most of which were the football players. Gabby and I kept to ourselves mostly until she looked up and froze. I looked over to where she was staring, and I saw nothing that would raise concern. \"Gabby, what is wrong?\" I questioned her. \"Don\\'t freak out, but the guy that hit on me in the cafeteria is over there.\" I felt the familiar surge of anger course through me, but I suppressed it for Gabriella\\'s sake. \"Which one is he?\" I asked. \"The blond one in the center of the crowd right next to the brunette.\" I looked over to the person in question who was \"playfully\" slapping his friends back. I had to resist the urge to go over and slap him myself, but I knew Gabriella wanted to avoid conflict. \"Do you want to leave?\" I asked her, understanding that she probably felt uncomfortable. \"No. What happened was months ago, and it was not that big of a deal. He probably doesn\\'t even remember, and he also wouldn\\'t dare try to hit on me again with you here.\" To emphasize her point I pulled her closer to me, put my arm around her, and kissed her. We resumed talking, though Gabriella seemed a bit more mellow compared to earlier. We stayed there for an hour or so longer, and then we paid and got ready to leave. Gabby was nervous, but I held her hand and led her through the crowd. We had almost reached the door when a random guy popped up out of nowhere and pressed through Gabby and I breaking us apart. After that, the crowd seemed to swallow us up, until I couldn\\'t see her. I walked towards to direction that she had been. I looked around for a few moments until I saw her. The guy who had hit on her months ago was slowly but surely pining her to a wall a few feet away. I was furious, I quickly parted the crowd in order to reach her. I then saw the guy grab her arms and lean in to kiss her when I pulled him off her and punched him square in the jaw. Though I am a basketball player, I have a heavy build. My dad always puts a great importance on weight training and basic fighting, so I knew that his jaw would not break, but he would definitely feel the punch for a few days. Before he could register what happened to him, I felt Gabriella in my arms, and I hoarsely whispered in her ear. \"We should go.\" I felt her nod, but she did not pull away, so my mind went on autopilot, and I tried to push her away so that we could walk, but she wouldn\\'t. \"Gabby, why don\\'t I give you a piggy back ride out of here. That way we will not be separated again.\" Before she had time to respond, I had her on my back, and we were out the door. I put her down when we reached the car and opened the door for her. She then let go of me. When I got in the driver\\'s seat, and looked over and saw her trying not to cry. \"Gabby, did he hurt you?\" \"He grabbed my arm, but not enough to injure it.\" \"I am so sorry I wasn\\'t there.\" \"Troy, I do not and will never blame you for that. I just wish I had been strong enough to deal with him on my own.\" \"Babe, there wouldn\\'t have been anything you could do. He was like a head taller than you, and probably had one hundred pounds on you.\" \"I know that, but I still am trying to think of ways that could have prevented it.\" \"If there is anything that I can do, please tell me.\" \"I will. Thank you, Troy.\" I still was worried about her, but I knew that it would be best if I just dropped her off at her dorm, so that she could process everything. She was so strong. I am just worried about how I am going to protect her when I am at away basketball games. She is my world, and I don\\'t know what I would do without her.'][Chapter 7] ['I am so sorry that I haven\\'t updated in so long! My life has been crazy lately! Also, thank you for the reviews. It is so encouraging and keeps me motivated! Without further ado... let\\'s begin;) Chapter 7 (Troy\\'s POV) It has been a month since the repeat of the incident with Gabriella. She seemed freaked out immediately after it, but now we had calmed down and settled back into our normal routines. It is now October, and basketball practice was getting more and more intense. Gabby and I were also seeing less and less of each other, however, we do our best to see each other around every week. We are both getting more and more excited for fall break. She and I were thinking of going back to Albuquerque. We just have to make it through these next 2 weeks. Luckily today is Sunday, so I can just enjoy my day off of basketball and see Gabby. We decided to meet at a park that was in between our two colleges. When I got there she was sitting on a bench, reading her favorite book, Pride and Prejudice. I slowly snuck up behind her and kissed her cheek. Most people would immediately realize that it was there significant other, however, Gabby just turned around and slapped me. While I didn\\'t feel anything all I heard was, \"Oh my goodness, Troy! I am so sorry!\" All I could do was laugh. She reminded me of a sweet little bunny who could never really hurt anyone, and I loved her all the more for it. After that little incident, our date went smoothly and all too soon it was time to say goodbye and prepare for another week of school. After we parted I felt a familiar feeling of loss. It wasn\\'t that I couldn\\'t live without Gabriella, but that I never want to. It is already hard enough to be only around an hour away. I can only be thankful that I came to Berkeley. The week passed slowly by, and I hadn\\'t been able to see Gabby since Sunday. However, my luck (hopefully) changed for the better in my dramatic arts class on Wednesday. It was announced by my teacher that as a new program, Berkeley and Stanford would unite in one common goal... to create a play performance together. most of the class groaned, but for me, this meant that Gabriella and I could maybe perform together again. My bubble was metaphorically popped as I heard the teachers next words. \"While many may view this as an excellent opportunity, know that after combining the two drama classes as well as the other auditionees, the total number of people who will go out may number as many as 1,000, and we will be choosing maybe 30 people to fill the rolls. To further encourage putting your best foot forward, this performance will be viewed by many and will be performed in the National Theatre. So good luck to you all!\" With those final words, she successfully dashed all my hopes of Gabriella and I actually being able to perform together, but it still was worth a shot. Auditions were in 2 weeks. With the thought of the play or musical in my mind, I set forward to my next class. I didn\\'t get a chance to check my phone until after basketball, around 4 pm. As I opened up my lock screen, I saw that I had around 10 texts from Gabby. Obviously, she had heard about the play, and I didn\\'t even need to read the texts to guess her reaction. She always spammed me when she was excited about something. I then decided to call her as she had repeatedly told me to do so in her texts. I heard her number being dialed and put the phone to my ear. \"Troy?\" \"Hey, Gabby.\" \"I am assuming that you finally read my texts.\" \"You are assuming correctly, my dear.\" \"Well?\" \"Well, what?\" I said feigning ignorance. \"Are we going to try out together?\" \"Of course, sweetheart. As soon as I heard about it I knew that I wanted to, but Gabby. What will happen if only one of us makes it?\" \"Then, we will figure it out together.\" I then looked at my watch and realized that I had to go or I would be late for a team dinner. \"Sweetheart,\" I said, \"I have to go now. Can I talk to you later?\" \"Definitely. Love you, bye.\" \"Love you.\" With that, we ended the call. Saturday: 1 1/2 weeks later I was waiting for Gabby outside the entrance to the theatre where the tryouts were being held. As I looked around I saw many faces, some of which were familiar, others were not. As I picked up my phone to call her again to see where she was, I felt a pair of arms wrap around me and heard. \"Hi, Wildcat! Who were you waiting for?\" \"My beautiful girlfriend who is 15 minutes late,\" I said jokingly. \"Come on, let\\'s go in.\" Without waiting for a reply I grabbed her hand and started walking. She just laughed and smiled. When we entered the auditorium almost every seat was taken, and slowly people were being called back. \"This is going to take a while,\" Gabby said with a grimace. I only nodded in agreement. Eventually, I heard our names called. We did the audition, and, per usual, Gabby was amazing, and I became pretty certain that she would be in the play, probably a minor role as it was near impossible either of us was going to be one half of the lead couple. They made one last announcement before we left. \"Thank you all for coming and auditioning. We will have the cast list posted on the website on Friday.\" With that Gabby and I walked out. Friday: I woke up early on Friday, and I had completely forgotten to check the cast list until later that day. The only reason that I had remembered was because of the pitying glances that followed me all day. When I checked the cast list, I only felt shocked. Pride and Prejudice Cast: Elizabeth Bennet- Gabriella Montez Fitzwilliam Darcy- Byron Steel ... Colonel Fitzwilliam- Troy Bolton I could barely register what had happened. Gabriella, my Gabby, ended up with some guy. At this point, I was running on autopilot, so I searched this Byron Steel on the internet. I didn\\'t realize that I could feel worse than I already did, but I managed it. Byron Steel was the guy that hit on Gabriella. Thank you so much for reading! I am so sorry again that I haven\\'t updated in a while! It has been really crazy with school. I will try to get an update done next week or sooner. If you like it, let me know. Every time I get a review it makes my day!'][Chapter 8] ['Hi, Guys! Thank you so much for all the followers and reviews! Each and everyone makes my day! Chapter 8 (Troy\\'s POV) I still couldn\\'t wrap my head around the fact that Gabby was going to pretend to be in love with another guy. And with that sick jerk too! My first inclination was to pull out, and just not do it, but if Gabby was going to do it, then I would need to do it so that I could protect her if she even still wanted to do it. It was just then that I got a call. \"Troy. Have you seen the list?\" Even through the phone, I could hear the mixed emotions in her voice. It was like she was trying to decide what was the best way to react. \"Yeah, I saw it, Babe,\" I responded, \"I am so happy for you! The lead? This could be a huge opportunity!\" I could almost sense her starting to become excited. \"I was so excited when I first saw it, but should I actually do it since we are not together?\" \"We still will see each other at every rehearsal. Which is three times the amount we have been seeing each other lately.\" \"That is true... I guess I will do it. Do you know who this Byron Steel is?\" \"That is some bad news, sweetheart. Byron is the blond football player that you have had a few encounters with.\" \"...\" \"Don\\'t worry, Gabs. I will be there at every practice to make sure that he can\\'t hurt you.\" \"Thank you, Troy. Anyways, I probably should start looking over my lines. Practice starts on Monday!\" \"Bye, Babe. Love you.\" \"Love you too.\" Monday Morning: I was in my seat at the usual time for drama class which was now being turned into rehearsal. I still hadn\\'t seen Gabby. I then saw the director on stage. \"Hello, everyone. As you all know, you, students, have been chosen to perform this play. You are an elite group of excellent actors, and we are very glad to have you here. One by one, please come up to the stage, say your character, and tell us a bit about yourselves, such as favorite sports, subject, etc.\" \"The first person on the stage was a happy looking young fellow who played Charles Bingley. His name was Thomas Williams. After him came Sara Anderson, who played Jane, as well as a few others. Gabriella then came on. \"Hi! My name is Gabriella Montez, and I am studying to become a lawyer. I am playing Elizabeth Bennet, and my boyfriend is actually here too. He is playing Colonel Fitzwilliam.\" I smiled at that and walked up to the stage, and kissed her on the cheek, and then I announced myself. After everyone had finished introducing themselves, the director asked each of us to go on stage and do a few of our lines. Everyone went. As Gabby walked on stage and performed, I couldn\\'t help but have a cheesy looking smile on my face. It was clear to me that she was made for this role. She played her part so perfectly that it made me want to rush to the character\\'s defense. I obviously was smiling too much as the guy next to me said to me, \"I wouldn\\'t smile as much, you know she has a boyfriend.\" I turned towards the guy and I saw that it was Thomas Williams. He was smiling in a knowing way and continued. \"You look like you have already fallen hard. I will say that she is beautiful, do you know her from classes?\" \"I do. I have had a crush on her for the longest time,\" I responded with a smile. \"Wait, are you her boyfriend?\" \"That I am. I have been for 3 years. We met in High School, and we quickly fell in love. We have been dating ever since.\" I must have again started my smiling, as Thomas said, \"Boy, I haven\\'t even seen the two of you interact and I can see that you are whipped.\" \"I am proud to be so.\" As I said this we started talking and before I knew it, it was my time to perform. I felt great about both Gabby\\'s and my performance. However, the director looked at me funnily and then stood straight up. \"Excuse me, everyone. I am afraid that there has been a terrible mistake. It seems that two of the applicant\\'s resumes have been mixed up. I do apologize, but Mr. Byron Steel you never were intended for the show. You were intended to be an understudy for Mr. Wickham. Another applicant had been misinformed, and they are Colonel Fitzwilliam. Mr. Troy Bolton, you were meant to be Mr. Darcy. I do apologize to Mr. Steel.\" I didn\\'t hear anything after that. All I felt was an overwhelming feeling of joy and relief. I can\\'t remember much else, but I do remember kissing Gabriella and twirling her around. Everything had worked out perfectly, and I couldn\\'t be happier. I knew then that this was going to be a great year of college. Time Passes... As the play has been starting, it has been really fun to be able to see Gabby so often. At least 5 days a week we are spending together working on the play. Originally when the play was announced, Gabby and I both were disappointed that there would be no music, but the director soon made an announcement saying that musical numbers would be worked into the play. It felt so good to get back into the theatre, but I knew that soon I would become overworked and exhausted as basketball season starts in January and it is November. Before we knew it, it was Thanksgiving break, and Gabby and I were heading back to Alberquerque. It was the day before we were scheduled to leave, and I felt my phone buzz. I looked down and saw that Gabriella was calling. \"Hey Sweetheart,\" I said. \"Hi, Wildcat! I was just checking in before we leave tomorrow. Remember that our flight is at 9 pm. have you got everything packed? And will you be picking up me, or should we meet at the airport? Also, remember to wear something comfy tomorrow for the airplane. Can I borrow a phone charger too? should I print off the tickets tonight?\" \"Woah, Gabs. Slow down. I know what time our flight is at. I am almost done packing. I will pick you up tomorrow at 6:30 in front of your dorm, and I will bring a phone charger and the printed tickets. Was there anything I forgot?\" \"I don\\'t think so. Sorry for going crazy there for a sec.\" I could virtually hear her blushing through the phone. \"Ok, then. I have to go to practice now, Babe. I love you so much.\" \"I love you too. See you tomorrow.\" Next Day... (Gabriella\\'s POV) I was waiting for Troy to come anxiously. I couldn\\'t stop checking my watch. Uggh it is only 6:25. This means that I will have to wait longer. Troy has a habit of always arriving exactly on time, no sooner, no later. While it was annoying as I love to be as early as possible, I love him and his quirks, also he is just so darn cute! As I became lost in my thoughts I soon heard his car pull up. I ran outside and hugged him. It felt so good just to be in his arms. Since we had been doing the play we almost had no time just to go on dates or hang out. I have been so excited for this trip! \"Ready?\" He asked me. \"Yep!\" I responded. I moved to grab my bags, but before I knew what had happened, Troy had grabbed them. \"I can carry my own bags.\" \"I know, but I promised that I would always take care of you. Carrying your bags is a small thing I can do to care for you.\" I pretended to be annoyed, but I couldn\\'t help but smile. He is the cutest thing. Even after three years he still makes me get butterflies in my stomach. \"Fine.\" He put my bags in the trunk and then opened the door for me. As we drove to the airport we turned on the radio and started blasting the music. Then the radio switched songs, and All of Me came on. When the chorus cam eon Troy started to belt it out. \"Troy! You are so cheesy!\" He only smirked and continued to sing. We arrived at the airport and checked our bags. It was so fun to just hang out as we walked to our gate. We boarded and got ready to take off. I barely remember the flight as I soon fell asleep on Troy\\'s shoulder. The next thing I remember was Troy waking me up. \"Gabby,\" he spoke in a sing-songy tone. \"Wake up, Honey... Sweetheart.\" \"Hmm. Troy? Are we there yet?\" Before he could answer my question the flight monitor came on. \"Get ready, folks. We are descending into Alberquerque.\" \"We are home, Gabby.\" Sorry for the time it took me to update! Life has been very hectic! Enjoy!'][Chapter 9] ['Just pure fluff in this chapter! Enjoy! As the flight landed, I looked over to see how Gabriella was doing. She was, as usual, making sure that everything was ready for us to hop off the flight. By the time we arrived at the gate it was almost 11 pm, so we grabbed our bags, rented a car, and arrived at my house. Gabriella\\'s mother had left Albuquerque when Gabby moved to college, so we were both staying at my house. I found the key under the flower pot, and opened the door, assuming that both my parents would be asleep, but as soon as we walked in my mom pounced and started talking at 100 miles an hour. Except for this time she wasn\\'t talking to me, she was hugging Gabby and taking care of her, completely ignoring me. \"Mom! Any love left to spare for your only son?\" \"Oh hush, honey! Now be a good boy and carry Gabriella\\'s bags up to the guest room.\" Recognizing that it was useless to argue, I grudgingly carried our bags upstairs. Gabby giggled and then, arm in arm with my mom walked into the kitchen. When I came back downstairs, I saw my mom had wrapped a blanket around Gabby and given her a cup of hot apple cider. I couldn\\'t bear to feel annoyed at my mom, as this made me feel happier than all the coddling in the world would. The two women I love most just talking like any mother and daughter would. Gabriella then looked up. \"Why are you skulking over there, Troy? You could join us.\" Without answering her I solemnly walked over to them, and once she had turned back to my mom, I gave her a giant bear hug and stole her apple cider. \"Hey! Troy!\" She pouted. She looked so adorable, and I couldn\\'t resist her even if I wanted to. I gave her back her cider and sat next to her at the table, putting my arm around her. She looked at me and smiled. This was home. I then turned to face my mom, who was smiling like the Cheshire cat. Knowingly looking at us. I then decided to change the subject. \"So, Mother dear, do you know where my old man is?\" \"Your \\'old\\' man is in the tv room asleep on the couch. I swear he cannot stay awake past 10 these days, and he is only 45!\" Gabby and I both chuckled. Gabby then rose up to leave. \"I might go to bed now… I am exhausted. Thank you, Mrs. Bolton, for letting me stay here and for the apple cider!\" \"Oh, any time dear. And no more of that Mrs. Bolton stuff. Call me Mom or Lucille! You are family!\" \"Thank you, Mom,\" Gabby responded. She then turned to me, \"Night, Troy.\" \"Goodnight Sweetheart. Sleep well.\" I kissed her on the cheek, and she left. Once she left the room. My mom turned to me, saying: \"Well, when am I going to have grandbabies?\" \"MOM! We are freshmen in college!\" Despite the outward protests, internal pictures flashed in my head. Gabriella wearing a white dress, Gabriella pregnant, Gabriella holding a baby. Everything appeared so natural and perfect. Mom then brought me back to reality. \"I knew all your protests were false. Honey, you have been hit hard. Every part of you screams \\'whipped\\'.\" \"If loving her is whipped, then I am most definitely whipped. Mom, she is the best thing that ever happened to me. She is smart, brilliant, funny, and kind. What did I ever do to deserve her?\" \"Don\\'t sell yourself short, Honey. She feels the same way about you as you do about her, but Troy, be careful. She is a wonderful woman and I love her to pieces, but don\\'t idolize her. It will do neither of you any good. She has her faults and so do you, but part of true love is recognizing the other person\\'s faults and loving them despite them and helping them improve. I will say that despite this, you two are the cutest couple I have ever seen!\" This last thing she said was I full fangirl mode, and I rolled my eyes. Nevertheless, I appreciated the advice she gave. We talked for a bit more, and then I went upstairs. Before going into my room, I looked into the guest room and saw Gabriella fast asleep like a little bump under the covers. I went up to her and kissed her forehead. \"I love you forever, my girl.\" (Gabriella\\'s POV) I woke up the next morning feeling more well rested than I had in months. I looked over at my clock and saw that it was 8:30. I hopped out of bed, and went downstairs, not bothering to brush my teeth or hair. When I entered the kitchen, I saw that Mom Bolton had made buttermilk pancakes, bacon, and eggs. Both Mr. and Mrs. Bolton were sitting at the table eating. \"Hello!\" \"Hi, Sweetie! Help yourself to breakfast. Did you sleep well?\" Mom Bolton said this so cheerily, I was amazed any person could be this cheerful this early in the morning. \"Yes, I did, better than I have for months! Thank you for breakfast!\" \"I am glad to hear it! Jack greet Gabriella!\" \"Honey, I was waiting for you to finish. I swear the poor girl doesn\\'t need two people harassing her at once.\" He spoke to me,\" It\\'s great to see you, Gabriella.\" He then hugged me. We had had our difficulties in the past, but eventually, we came to terms and he was like a father to me.\" \"It\\'s good to see you too! How are the Wildcat\\'s looking this year?\" \"Well, I don\\'t think we can beat last years team, but pretty good.\" \"That\\'s great.\" I moved to get my breakfast, then asked, \"Is Troy awake yet?\" \"We haven\\'t seen him.\" \"How late did you guys stay up last night?\" \"Well, honey, he seemed considerably less interested in staying up after you went to bed, so only a half hour or so.\" Mom Bolton said. I laughed, \"Well since he is being such a sleepy-head, I think we have two clear options. Either we wake him up, or I see some embarrassing pictures and hear some stories.\" Both of them started laughing and started a story. (Troy\\'s POV) I woke up to the sound of laughter. I looked around and realized that I wasn\\'t in my dorm. Everything from last night started coming back to me. I hopped out of bed quickly. I am so excited. I get to see Gabby from the time I wake up... what would it be like to see her every morning? I raced downstairs loudly as I always did when I was little. \"He\\'s here,\" Mom said. Gabby turned around and smiled, but not her usual sweet smile... her evil \"I know something you don\\'t\" smile. \"Oh no. What did I miss?\" I almost didn\\'t want to hear the answer. \"We were just discussing a moment you may remember from 2nd grade. Tell me if this rings a bell. Sweet little Troy and Chad were standing on the top of the playset, and a young child that you didn\\'t like was standing below you, so as an evil form of revenge, you decide to pee on him?\" Gabriella said this all with a mischievous grin, looking very smug. I could feel myself growing bright red. The poor kid who I peed on was looking up... he got a face full of urine. Not one of my best moments. \"MOM. DAD. Seriously?\" The trio just burst out laughing. Gabriella then stood up, wrapped her arms around me, and gave me a peck on the lips. \"I love you anyway, my little park pooper.\" This just caused more fits of laughs. \"I did not poop, thank you very much. And dear, sweet Ella. I would not let my parents tell you too many stories, as I have some of you that I could share AND your mother\\'s phone number.\" I knew my words hit their mark, as she paled a bit, but still had the smile on her face. I then kissed her on the cheek and walked to get breakfast. Before long, we had all finished eating, so Gabby and I had made plans with Chad, Taylor, Ryan, and Kelsey to go on the Danforths boat. There was a single large lake about 20 minutes away from my house that Chad and I always used to go on, so I was excited to take Gabs there. We both went to our respective rooms and then changed. Once I had finished changing I walked across the hall to Gabby\\'s room and knocked on the door. \"Ella, you ready?\" \"Come on in!\" She yelled. After I walked in, I could barely move my feet. She was wearing a blue bikini with a high neckline. SHe looked fantastic. I couldn\\'t help but stare. \"Earth to Troy.\" \"Hmmm.\" SHe quickly threw a cover-up over her head. \"Like what you see, Wildcat?\" \"Oh yeah. You are breathtaking.\" She moved towards me and kissed me. No matter how many times we kissed, each kiss was special and as meaningful as our first. the only thought playing through my head is that one day I will marry this girl. How did I ever get so lucky? \"Come on, Troy. We better go... We don\\'t want to be late!\" Before I knew what was happening, we were out the door and in my car, driving toward the lake. I am trying to decide if I want to actually write the day at the lake out, or just go back to school. Any ideas are welcome and appreciated!'][Chapter 10] ['Chapter 10: Gabriella and I hopped in the car and headed to Chad\\'s house. By the time we got there, we saw all of the old high school gang were waiting. Chad, Zeke, and Ryan were playing basketball, well Chad and Zeke were playing basketball and Ryan was attempting. Sharpee, Taylor, and Kelsi were sitting on the side and talking. Gabriella hopped out of the car out ran to Taylor, Kelsi, and Sharpee. All the girls were squealing and started chatting like they never had been apart. I then got out of the car and greeted the guys. I immediately was drawn into a game, and we were playing for another half hour until the girls decided to take matters into their own hands and all started distracting us in order to get us ready to go to the lake. Gabriella snuck up behind me and jumped on my back, which caused me to nearly jump out of my skin, and almost drop her. And the others were surprised in similar ways by their respective partners. Since we were disrupted from the game, we all prepared to leave and soon we were on the road. The guys all launched the boat and we were off. We started off doing tube wars. A game that Chad and I had been playing since we were little. It consisted of two tubes being pulled behind the boat, one was a donut tube and the other was a flat tube. We moved around until we could knock the other people on the other tube off. It was our favorite thing to do. Gabby and I were on the donut. We started off at a relatively slow pace, but soon we were bouncing into each other. Then in one fail swoop, we rammed into each other especially hard and Gabby went flying from my lap and into the water. Zeke slowed the boat and we circled around to get her, but she hadn\\'t surfaced yet. We waited another couple seconds and I was starting to get nervous. \"Gabby!\" I called. I looked and she still didn\\'t surface. I then felt hands on my back that pulled me into the water. I surfaced and spluttered. Gabriella was smiling wickedly at me and laughed, a little out of breath. \"Your heavier than I thought you were!\" She said panting. I ignore her and say, \" Don\\'t\\' scare me like that! You had me worried for a sec!\" \"Troy, I was a lifeguard. I had to go through extensive training to qualify! I can hold my breath!\" We swam back to the boat, and I was still pouting. After a while, it was lunch time and we headed back to Chad\\'s lake house to eat. We quickly ate, and then went back on the boat for a couple hours. After a few more tube wars, we wrapped up the day and headed back to the house to clean up and play a few yard games. After the girls cleaned up they went to the grocery store to pick up some things for dinner, and the guys decided to play a quick game of basketball and then start grilling. (Gabriella\\'s POV) Taylor, Kelsi, Sharpay, and I arrived at the grocery store, and we all set out to get the food for dinner. We split into groups of two, and Taylor and I finally got to talk. \"SO Gabs, how have you actually been. Don\\'t give me the watered down version.\" \"IS it really that obvious?\" \"ONly to me.\" \"Tay, it has been a hard semester.\" \"Is everything good between you and Troy?\" \"Of course! Troy is such a sweetheart. I don\\'t know what I did to deserve him.\" \"Then, what is it?\" \"Don\\'t get me wrong, I love so much about college, but there has been this guy who has consistently tried to seduce me. He has come up to me twice to try to get me to be with him.\" \"What did he do?\" \"Umm, one time he grabbed my shirt, and ripped it, the other time he backed me into a corner and tried to kiss me. Luckily, he hasn\\'t done anything in a while, so I hope he has completely forgotten me, but I can\\'t escape this nagging feeling that something is going to happen.\" \"I\\'m sorry, honey. That is hard. How has Troy been with all of this?\" \"He has done his best, but I can tell that it bothers him.\" Before Taylor could say anything else, Sharpay and Kelsi came back with the food, and we all headed to the checkout. As I pulled out the money to pay, I noticed a piece of paper at the bottom of the cart. I grabbed it, quickly paid then started walking. Haphazardly I opened the folded piece of paper, and then fear filled me as I read what it said. \"I\\'M WATCHING YOU.\" I tried to act nonchalant as we walked out of the store, and started to reason with myself that it couldn\\'t possibly be serious. It was probably just a practical joke. I do my best to put the note out of my mind and enjoy the rest of the evening. I almost forget about it, and we had a great time playing games and eating dinner with our friends. It was just like high school. Troy and I left when it was near midnight, and by then I had completely forgotten about the note. Troy opened the car door for me, and I git in. He came around to the other side and I remembered the note, realizing that I needed to tell him about it. Before he started driving, I start talking. \"Troy?\" I realized how uncertain I sounded. \"Yes, Sweetheart?\" \"There is something I need to tell you.\" I rush on without letting him speak. \"As we were checking out today at the store, I found a note at the bottom of the cart… it said \\'I\\'m watching you.\\'\" I pause, worried about Troy\\'s reaction. I look up. I see Troy\\'s face looking towards me with a combination of concern, anger, and love. He then questioned,\"Did you see anything or anyone near your cart? Anything suspicious?\" \"To be honest I was so busy talking with Taylor that I didn\\'t notice anything.\" Before I had finished speaking, Troy pulled me into his lap and held me close, I think more for his own comfort than for mine. (Troy\\'s POV) As I pulled Gabi into my lap, I couldn\\'t help but hold her tight. What did my sweet Ella do to deserve this? I can\\'t help but want to protect her, but how could I if someone could reach her at the grocery store. I held onto her tighter, never wanting to let go. After a short while, Gabi had fallen asleep as I stroked her hair. I gently shifted her to the passenger\\'s seat, and kept my hand on her knee, pulling out of the drive. As I drove down the dark streets on the way home, I still couldn\\'t stop thinking about the note. I love her so much, how could I live with myself if something happened to her, or worse, something happened to her because I couldn\\'t protect her. I turned on the radio to drown out my thoughts. Come home early after class Don\\'t be hanging \\'round the back of the schoolyard I\\'ve been called up by a teacher She says she can\\'t even reach you \\'cause you\\'re so far You\\'ve been talking with your fist We didn\\'t raise you up like this, now did we There have been changes in this house Things that you don\\'t know about in this family It don\\'t make sense, but nevertheless You gotta believe us, it\\'s all for the best It don\\'t make sense The way things go Son you should know Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love Sometimes two homes are better than one Some things you can\\'t tell your sister \\'cause she\\'s still too young Yeah you\\'ll understand When you love someone There ain\\'t no one here to blame Nothing\\'s going to change with your old friends Your room will stay the same \\'Cause you\\'ll only be away on the weekends It don\\'t make sense, but nevertheless You gotta believe us, it\\'s all for the best It don\\'t make sense The way things go Son you should know Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love Sometimes two homes are better than one Some things you can\\'t tell your sister \\'cause she\\'s still too young Yeah you\\'ll understand When you love someone I sang along, and somehow I relaxed, we arrived home before the song ended, so I hopped out of the car, and walked to the other side. I opened Gabby\\'s door and gently lifted her. She moved around a bit and then nestled further into me. I carried her into the house. I slowly walked up the stairs and carried her into her room, laid her on the bed, and tucked her in. I kissed her forehead, and she smiled in her sleep. I quietly walked out of the room and shut the door. I went to my room, hopped into bed, and immediately fell asleep. The rest of the week flew by, and soon Gabby and I were at the airport, preparing to depart. I said goodbye to Mom and Dad. My Mom was crying. \"Oh, Honey! I\\'ll miss you so much!\" \"Don\\'t worry, Mom. We\\'ll be back for Christmas before you know it!\" \"Troy! I wasn\\'t talking to you! I was talking to Gabby!\" I roll my eyes as Gabby giggles. Before I knew it. We were finally on the plane heading back to school.'][Chapter 11] ['I am so, so sorry for how long it has taken me to update this! I have been very busy lately, and haven\\'t had as much time as I would like to work on this! I would like to particularly thank thoughts-of-joy-dreams-of-love for their continued support and kind words! This chapter is pure fluff, and as of right now, I am planning to just get Troy and Gabriella through freshman year as quickly as possible, but any ideas, feedback, and constructive criticism are appreciated! Soon, Christmas had come and gone, flying by quickly, and we were headed back to school. Shortly after that, we had the performance of our play, and the basketball season began! As the days passed by, Gabby and I were seeing less and less of each other. She was busy with homework, and I was at practice almost constantly. It has been hard not seeing my Ella as frequently as the previous semester, but this week I have my first game to look forward to. NO matter how little we had seen each other in the past couple of weeks, I knew nothing would keep her from being at the game. As the week led up to the game, anticipation, and nerves began to fill me. Finally, it was Friday. The whole school seemed to anticipate the game; though I would never admit it I was more nervous than I had ever been. The coach expected a lot from me, and it would be my first game without Chad. As I steadily became more and more panicked, Gabby, as usual, seemed to sense my stress as she texted me. \"Hey, Babe! How are you doing? I can\\'t wait to see you rock their worlds tonight! Love you:)\" I immediately texted back. \"To be honest, a little stressed, but I am just focusing on seeing a certain beautiful girl tonight:)\" \"Who would that be?\" \"Very funny, Gabs.\" \"Love you too;) I\\'ve got to go to class, but then I will head to the game! I might even where Berkeley colors;)\" I chuckled to myself and said goodbye. Just knowing she would be there calmed me. Before I knew it I was in the locker room with my jersey having a pep talk with the team. We headed out to the arena and were greeted by deafening cheers and applause. We approached the court and began practicing our layups and free throws. As the five chosen for the court at the beginning took their positions I from my bench vantage point sought out Gabriella. It took a minute, but I soon locked eyes with an unmistakable pair of deep chocolate brown eyes. I saw my Ella smiling at me and she mouthed what I understood to be \"I love you, Wildcat.\" Then we broke eye contact as the game began. Within the first 5 minutes, I could already see this would be a high scoring game. We were currently up by 5, but our luck would not last. Right before the first quarter ended our star player was injured, as after he came down from his shot he landed on his ankle, and I heard a snap. His foot was most decidedly broked. the coach quickly put in the other senior who had not been played yet, and before we could blink it was halftime and we were down by thirty. In short, we were being creamed. We went to the locker during the half-time and then we were back. What surprised me was then the coach put me in...freshman were never put in. When I stepped on the court, all of a sudden a sense of calm came over me, and I knew what to do. My body took over for me, and I moved by instinct alone. I lost count of how many baskets I shot, and even more, of how many went in. Finally, the game had 1 minute left. We had made a significant comeback, and we had let very few baskets in, but we were still behind by 2. I looked around, none of my teammates were open, and I knew I had to just stall until we got a shot, we couldn\\'t afford to let the other team get the ball. 30 seconds left, and still, no one was open. 20 seconds, no one open. 10 seconds, I looked desperately around. No one. I was still around half court. 5 seconds. I looked around and caught a glimpse of Gabriella. She gave me strength, and I took a deep breath. 2 seconds. the ball was flying through the air. I watched as it landed in the hoop. We won. nothing that happened after that registered in my brain until the need to hug and hold Gabby overwhelmed me. I weeded my way through the crowd of teammates, who all offered congratulations at a great game. And then I saw her. My beautiful girl. Before I knew what hit me, Gabby latched on to me and hugged me. \"I am so proud of you, Wildcat! You were amazing!\" Before she could say more, I kissed her soundly on the lips and though I could feel her initial surprise, quickly she melted into the kiss. We broke apart, and then she said impishly: \"Troy, you are still holding me.\" I hadn\\'t even realized I was, but then I noticed the presence of her legs wrapped around my waste. I didn\\'t even respond, I just tightened my grip around her waist. \"Well, when I haven\\'t seen my beautiful girlfriend hardly at all in the past 2 weeks, then it\\'s not like I\\'ll just let her go when she\\'s finally here!\" Eventually, I set Gabby down as I needed to quickly take a shower before we headed out to grab some food. I think I took the fastest shower of my life, and as I was on my way back to Gabriella, the coach stopped me. \"Troy, fantastic job today! If your work continues to be like today, then I just might have to make you a starter!\" \"Thank you, sir. I was glad to be given the opportunity to play. Any word on James(injured player)?\" \"No, but I fear he may not be able to play again after that fall.\" Just as I opened my mouth to respond, I felt a pair of arms, wrap around my waist in a hug. I knew it could only be one person. I turned towards Gabby and smiled. A couple of years previously, I never could have imagined she would so willingly show affection in public, but she has grown so much in her shy nature, and it fills me with pride to know that this beautiful girl loves me enough to hold me like this. I reached my arm and placed it around her shoulders. \"Coach, this is my lovely girlfriend, Gabriella Montez.\" \"It is great to meet you, Coach Smith! Troy has told me so much about you and the team.\" Gabriella added on. \"It is a pleasure to meet you, Miss Montez. Troy talks about you all the time, I didn\\'t believe his description of your beauty could be accurate, but I must say, he wasn\\'t exaggerating! Troy, don\\'t lose this one.\" \"I will do everything in my power not to,\" Troy said with a smile. \"It was a delight meeting you Miss Montez, see you in practice, Troy.\" With that, the coach left. I moved to grab Gabriella\\'s hand and noticed she was wearing my old basketball jersey, It filled me with pride to see her in it. She had styled it as a dress due to the fact that I am a foot taller than her, and her petite frame was dwarfed by my size. We headed out of the stadium and drove to the ice cream place. Thank you for reading!']","Summary":" ['It had been three days since their graduation, and Gabriella was blissfully happy. She was drivin"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"This Slope Is Treacherous","Author":"lipstickdisaster","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13183001","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['A/N: So… I wrote a multi-chaptered Gabriella/Sharpay fic. I\\'ve been very intrigued by this pairing for a while now and there\\'s a lack of fanfiction for those two, so I thought I\\'d try to – at least partially – rectify that. Furthermore, the idea of an AU where Gabriella properly auditions for the musical has been swimming around my head for a while, and it\\'s been very fun exploring that, even though the fic was a beast to write. This first chapter is still largely canon compliant with some small changes, but I hope it\\'s still enjoyable! As always, please leave a review, that makes my day! And you can find me on Tumblr at gabriellabolton (my main blog) and at bisexualsharpay (my HSM sideblog). Come yell at me about Gabpay and other HSM-related things! New year. New semester. Yet another new school. Gabriella sighs as she tightens her grip on her bag and attempts to ignore the nausea that has been plaguing her ever since she woke up this morning. She hates doing this. She hates having to up and leave every single semester, every time she thinks she has finally settled in whatever place her mother has dragged her off to. She doesn\\'t blame her mother, though, for she knows that her mother has little say in all of these transfers. She just wishes things were different. She just wishes she felt at home somewhere, that she wouldn\\'t have to feel so lonely all the time. This new school is even worse than all the ones before, though. Sick and tired of all the transfers herself, her mother has made her employer promise that they won\\'t have to move again until graduation. That means that Gabriella is going to be here for a year and a half. And she can\\'t be the freaky math girl again. Not this time around. She refuses to be miserable. She has to make a fresh start. She just has no idea how to do that. She supposes she should have made a plan over the Christmas break, done some research about the school and the extracurricular activities it offers, but instead, she made the terrible decision to ignore her problems and focus her attention on a good book instead. And then she got distracted from her book by karaoke. And a boy. A very cute boy. They had been picked at random, and neither had wanted to sing – she had stage fright and he had told her later that he had a general lack of interest in music in general, even despite his beautiful voice. Yet both of them had found the experience strangely invigorating, and they had hit it off instantly. For the next week, she hadn\\'t been able to take her mind off what happened that night. She hadn\\'t been able to believe that she, Gabriella Montez, would be up on stage and singing her heart out without fainting on the spot. All because of those blue eyes. However, even though she definitely can trace her enjoyment of that night to his presence, she also knows that it wasn\\'t just because of him. She has been in desperate need to do something different, something crazy, for so long and that night, she finally managed to light that flame that\\'s been trying to flicker inside of her. If she could light that flame back then, she\\'s sure she can do it now. And as her mother told her, she just has to be herself. She can do that. Probably. Maybe. Kind of. So, with a deep breath, she steps into her new homeroom. Trying to move inconspicuously as possible, she pushes past a blonde girl dressed entirely in pink to take a seat in the back of the class, sighing with relief as she sits down. She can do something different, but she can also just blend in and pretend she doesn\\'t exist. That seems like a better, much safer plan. And it\\'s one that she can pull off. That is until the class quiets down and the homeroom teacher – an eccentrically dressed woman named Ms. Darbus – starts rollcall, which is the exact moment her phone suddenly starts ringing. Feeling her face flush with embarrassment, she fishes her phone out of her bag, her eyebrows furrowing in confusion as she finds out who\\'s calling her. It\\'s Troy from the ski lodge. Why would he call her on a Monday morning during class? Isn\\'t he supposed to be in school like her? She barely notices as two other students dispose their cellphones in Ms. Darbus\\'s bucket, before the woman appears before her, the older woman\\'s eyes glinting with fury. \"I suppose we\\'re going to get to know each other in detention, Ms. Montez,\" she barks, before raising her eyebrows as Gabriella stays frozen in horror for a moment, as the attention of the entire class seems to shift to her. Her lip trembling with embarrassment, she slowly drops her phone into a bucket, and for a moment, she braces herself for the inevitable request to introduce her to the class. It doesn\\'t come. Instead, Ms. Darbus\\'s attention has shifted, practically floating to the front of the classroom, where the blonde girl is sitting, next to a boy who looks a lot like... Troy? \"Mr. Bolton, it seems like your phone is involved, too. I\\'ll see you in detention,\" Ms. Darbus says, and the boy sighs as his phone disappears as well. Gabriella barely notices as another boy, with a giant afro, speaks up in a desperate bid to get his friend out of attention. She never got Troy\\'s last name that night at the ski lodge, but this Bolton boy, it\\'s him. She\\'s positive. She has thought about him too much not to recognize him. Maybe he recognized her, too, and that\\'s why he called her. Of course, she could just be wishing for it to be him, but she pushes that thought to the back of her mind. If it is him, though, that would mean she can\\'t disappear into the shadows like she wanted. It also means that there\\'s a constant reminder that she could just try to do something different, try to show more of herself, to try to keep that flame alive. She doesn\\'t know if that\\'s a good thing, but a part of her finds it exciting. So, as she watches the back of the boy\\'s head for the rest of the period, wondering if he is or isn\\'t Troy, the nervous jitters in her stomach turn pleasant. Maybe this new start might not be so bad after all. When the bell finally rings and Ms. Darbus finally stops lecturing the class about the evils of cellphones, there\\'s only one thing on Gabriella\\'s mind – find Troy. In her determination to get out of the classroom, however, she doesn\\'t watch where she\\'s going and quickly bumps into something. Or rather someone. As the person blocking her path turns around, Gabriella comes eye to eye with the pink blonde from before. Her hazelnut eyes are alight with fury and her lips are curled down into a scowl, but somehow, the only word Gabriella can think of is pretty . She knows girls like her. They\\'re always so physically perfect, so pretty that Gabriella finds it hard not to envy them, even despite her lack of interest in beauty. However, it\\'s not just this girl\\'s physical beauty that strikes her. That coldness in the girl\\'s eyes, she recognizes it and she dreads it. This girl could ruin her if they ever crossed paths. This girl needs to be avoided at all costs. So, with an apologetic smile, Gabriella ducks her head and mutters a quick apology, before resuming her mission to find Troy. Her mission is completed rather quickly, because she feels a hand land on her shoulder the minute she walks out of the classroom. And when she turns around to meet a sea of blue she has dreamed of so much the past week, she can\\'t help but smile. She also can\\'t help but notice how kind his eyes are, especially compared to the brown fury she just briefly experienced. \"I can\\'t believe it!\" he exclaims as a grin blossoms on his own face. Suddenly, she feels giddy, like a little schoolgirl. \"Me neither. I can\\'t believe you live here. I couldn\\'t find you at the lodge on New Year\\'s Day.\" Troy\\'s grin only grows as he holds out his arm to lead the way. She quickly grabs the map of the school that Principal Matsui handed to her, before they start walking. \"Sorry I didn\\'t call,\" he whispers in her ear as they move down the hallway. \"I left first thing in the morning and then I got busy.\" \"It\\'s okay,\" she says, before raising her eyebrows in amusement. \"But why are you whispering?\" Troy blushes a little with embarrassment as his hand flies up to his neck. \"I didn\\'t tell my friends about what happened on New Year\\'s Eve.\" \"Was it that embarrassing?\" she teases him, but a part of her does worry. Maybe it didn\\'t mean as much to him as it did to her. However, that doubt quickly evaporates as their eyes lock again and Troy assures her, \"No, I really, really enjoyed it.\" She can sense that isn\\'t everything, though. \"But?\" \"It\\'s just that it\\'s not my thing, I guess,\" Troy admits with a shrug as they enter the big hallway. With a grin, he points to a sign-up sheet on a bulletin. Musical Auditions , it reads. \"It seems like it is your thing, though, so I\\'m sure you\\'ll want to sign up for the musical.\" Gabriella bursts out laughing as she shakes her head furiously. Her? In a musical? That\\'s insane. She\\'d collapse and die the minute she\\'d go up on stage. \"I told you I have stage fright. Besides, I\\'m not signing up for anything right now. I just want to get to know the school first.\" She also still wishes to blend in and not draw attention to herself. Even though the plan seems to have failed already, as she\\'s already captured Troy\\'s attention, she\\'d like not to cause any further disturbances to the lives of the students of East High. However, she can\\'t help but feel intrigued by the musical. She did love how free she felt on stage with Troy, and she\\'d love to feel like that again. Maybe it wouldn\\'t be such a bad idea to sign up. Or she could take the safer route and watch people on stage and live vicariously through them. She could definitely enjoy watching Troy in the musical. So, raising an eyebrow, she tells him, \"I\\'d definitely buy a ticket if you were in the show, though.\" Troy laughs. \"Impossible.\" \"What\\'s impossible, Troy? I wouldn\\'t think that word applies to you.\" Both Troy and Gabriella look up at the presence of another voice, watching as a girl pops up from behind the bulletin board. Gabriella feels nervous as she realizes it\\'s the pretty pink girl from before. The girl\\'s eyes runs over her for a second, before she smiles condescendingly. \"Oh, you\\'re showing around the new girl.\" Then, she grabs a pen and turns to the sign-up sheet. Gabriella sneaks a quick glance at a wildly uncomfortable Troy, before returning her attention to the sign-up sheet, where the girl\\'s name now covers the entire pair\\'s auditions section. Sharpay Evans . What a peculiar name. Sharpay turns back to Troy and Gabriella, before her eyes widen. \"Oh, you were going to sign up? You\\'re welcome to, there\\'s a lot of supporting roles.\" Somehow, Gabriella doesn\\'t believe that she\\'s being earnest, especially as Sharpay smirks at her patronizingly. Feeling Troy\\'s alarmed eyes on her, Gabriella quickly shakes her head. \"No, I\\'m just looking around.\" Sharpay nods slowly, retaining her phony smile, but Gabriella can still see the suspicion in her eyes. Gabriella just offers her a smile. \"Well, I\\'ve gotta go. It was nice to meet you.\" Then, she waves at Troy, and takes one last look at the sign-up sheet and Sharpay\\'s name. This girl is used to power, that much is obvious. But she\\'s made a promise to herself. She\\'s not going to let herself be walked over at this school. Therefore, she casually comments, \"Nice penmanship.\" It\\'s a quick comment, but it seems to work, for Sharpay\\'s face falls, and Gabriella feels a sense of pride that she has gained the upper hand, even if just for a moment. She throws Troy one last smile, before walking off. When she\\'s at the end of the hallway, though, she can\\'t help but turn back one more time to see Troy and Sharpay in conversation. However, Sharpay doesn\\'t seem to be paying much attention, for her eyes, still furious, remain focused on Gabriella. With a shake of her head, Gabriella turns back around and keeps walking. It\\'s definitely not a good thing that she\\'s caught this girl\\'s attention, she thinks. But she\\'s not going to let Sharpay get her down. There\\'s something about this new girl. Something suspicious, something freaky. Since meeting her this morning, Sharpay hasn\\'t been able to shake her and she doesn\\'t know why. Maybe it\\'s how she was looking at the bulletin board earlier, when Troy Bolton – of all people! – was showing her around. Even though she denied profusely, Sharpay could tell that she was interested. She doesn\\'t think she has anything to worry about, though, since she\\'s a shoe-in for the lead as always, but she always feels fiercely protective of her drama club on the rare occasions an outsider tries to intrude. It\\'s just her natural instinct. There\\'s nothing weird going on besides that. Yet she can\\'t quite seem to shake the sparkle in the girl\\'s dark eyes. There\\'s something in those eyes that Sharpay just doesn\\'t trust, that sends a shiver down her spine. So, as any rational person with a suspicion would do, she decides to follow up. Glancing around the library to see if no one is watching what she\\'s doing, she types in the two words that make up the name that\\'s been sitting on her mind all day. Gabriella Montez . She watches as the results appear on the computer screen and her eyes widen as she clicks the first hit and the girl\\'s face appear on screen. Apparently, she won some big prize at an academic tournament. Apparently, Gabriella Montez is an Einsteinette. That should ease her mind. Gabriella is a nerd. Nerds don\\'t turn up at the musical auditions – well, at least not nerds of this kind. East High is a school of boxes, where everyone does what they\\'re supposed to do, and anyone who would dare to step out of line would be punished recklessly by the hive mind. People like Gabriella are part of the chemistry club, not the drama club. However, while this is comforting, it doesn\\'t really answer any of her questions. It doesn\\'t explain that look in her eyes or her possible interest in the musical or the fact that she\\'s hanging out with Troy Bolton, the Wildcats basketball superstar. Furthermore, a voice in her head whispers that how Gabriella doesn\\'t know East High yet. She doesn\\'t know about the status quo and what social rules she must obey. And Sharpay doesn\\'t know what it was like at Gabriella\\'s old school. Maybe the social hierarchies that exist here, didn\\'t exist there. Maybe she thinks she can be both in the science lab and on stage. She needs to be taught that this is not a possibility here at East High. She needs a proper welcome. She needs to be far away from the stage, she needs to be fit into a box that much better suits her interests. It\\'s a good thing Sharpay knows everything about everyone, because she knows a club that could make good use of Gabriella\\'s talents. So, she smirks at the screen as she prints out the article she found, finally feeling a little relieved as a plan forms in her mind. She is going to help Gabriella and she is going to teach her a lesson. And she knows exactly how to do that. \"The answer is yes!\" Sharpay perks up as she hears Taylor McKessie\\'s excited voice ring through the theatre. Looking up from the prop she\\'s been painting – damn Troy Bolton for inadvertently getting her in detention –, she watches as Gabriella Montez\\'s eyebrows furrow in confusion. \"How did you get that?\" Gabriella replies, pointing to the papers in Taylor\\'s hands, the ones that Sharpay had disposed in her locker. A satisfied smirk grows on Sharpay\\'s face as she recognizes the panic in Gabriella\\'s voice. She has regained the upper hand. Ignoring her brother\\'s questioning eyes on her, Sharpay keeps watching Taylor and Gabriella as a hawk as Taylor animatedly tells Gabriella about the wonders of the scholastic decathlon in a desperate bid to get her to join. Her little scheme is perfect, really, she thinks smugly. The scholastic decathlon will certainly be very welcoming to Gabriella, more welcoming than any other club will ever be, and the scholastic decathlon needs any help they can get to stay afloat. Furthermore, Gabriella will realize where she belongs and Sharpay won\\'t have to worry about her intruding on the drama club she\\'s put her heart and soul into all these years. Gabriella wins, Taylor wins, Sharpay wins. It\\'s a win-win-win situation. However, it seems like it isn\\'t working out as perfectly as she\\'s expected, since Gabriella seems to be be having doubts about Taylor\\'s offer. \"I still need to get caught up on the curriculum here, so I don\\'t know if I have the time for extracurricular activities,\" Gabriella explains, while Taylor\\'s face morphs into a disappointed frown. Sharpay purses her lips. Okay, so Gabriella is not falling for her scheme without some intervention. Maybe she should step in, help Taylor steer her towards the right path. So, putting on a smile, she walks over to the giant moon that Gabriella is painting. \"Ah, I see you\\'ve met Taylor. She can certainly help you get to know the school!\" Then, she turns to an utterly confused Taylor. \"You\\'re so kind to help, Taylor!\" When she turns back to Gabriella with a smirk, she feels an uncomfortable shiver run over her again as Gabriella is staring at her again, her gaze just as penetrating and unnerving as earlier. Of course Gabriella isn\\'t a fool. She knows exactly what game Sharpay is playing. However, it\\'s up to her to decide to play along or to go against the grain. Sharpay just hopes that Gabriella is smart enough to realize that she shouldn\\'t make an enemy out of her. After a moment of intense eye contact, Gabriella turns back to Taylor. \"You know what, I am actually trying to get to know the school a bit better, so would it be okay if I just came and attended a meeting sometime? I\\'m not signing up for now, though.\" Taylor squeals with excitement as she nods vigorously. \"I\\'m going to make sure you\\'ll love it!\" Gabriella smiles at Taylor, and Sharpay smiles, too, satisfied that her plan seems to have worked out after all, before turning around to walk back to her own prop. \"Wait.\" Sharpay turns back and quirks an eyebrow as she faces Gabriella, who suddenly seems nervous. \"I was wondering if it\\'s allowed to come watch the auditions?\" Gabriella asks, her voice a little shaky, averting her gaze from Sharpay and casting her gaze downwards as she taps her foot nervously. From the corner of her eye, Sharpay can see the surprise on Taylor\\'s face, but Sharpay can\\'t say she feels similarly. If anything, she just feels more suspicious. She knew it. Gabriella is interested in the musical after all. This is bad. Really bad. Gabriella was supposed to befriend Taylor McKessie and join the nerds and be right where she should be. She wasn\\'t supposed to be show interest in both the scholastic decathlon and the musical. She wasn\\'t supposed to intrude in places where doesn\\'t belong. Sharpay is going to make sure she knows she\\'s not welcome. \"Well, usually, no one really comes to auditions unless they\\'re auditioning and the deadline for signing up was an hour ago. Sorry.\" Gabriella blinks, before nodding despondently. \"I get it. I don\\'t want to intrude. I just wanted to get to know the school, see something new.\" Sharpay barks out a laugh, before shaking her head condescendingly. \"We don\\'t do new things at East High.\" Gabriella frowns, appearing disappointed, before looking to Taylor, who nods in confirmation. Biting her lip, she asks curiously, \"Why not?\" God, this girl doesn\\'t give up. If she wasn\\'t so annoying and acting against Sharpay\\'s interests, Sharpay would almost respect her for her persistence. \"It\\'s just the way things are,\" Sharpay responds curtly as she narrows her eyes at Gabriella in a menacing glare. When Gabriella looks to Taylor again, who merely shrugs, and she sighs, before shaking her head. \"Sorry, you\\'re right. That was silly of me.\" And that\\'s the end of it. At least, that\\'s what Sharpay hopes. Something tells her that it may not be as finished as she thinks. Shooting Gabriella a fake smile, she says, \"Well, if that\\'s all, I have props to paint. It was nice talking to you, ladies.\" And as she walks off with her head held high, she scoffs as she hears Taylor hiss, \"What was that?\" She would like to know that, too. When she arrives back at her prop and Ryan opens his mouth to say something, she just scowls and holds up a finger to stop him. \"Don\\'t.\" Then, she turns back to shoot Gabriella one last vicious glare. She doesn\\'t know what this girl\\'s deal is, but she does know that she hates her. Why did she ask Sharpay about the auditions? Gabriella has come to this new school with one clear goal – to blend into the crowds and finish her high school career without any further harassment by her peers. It has been less than a day and she already knows that this is probably going to be impossible, and it\\'s her own fault. She already knew that she was going to catch more attention than she bargained for the minute she ran into Troy, but that doesn\\'t mean she should actively aid in her own demise by bringing the wrath of the school\\'s resident ice queen upon herself. However, she supposes that it wasn\\'t entirely her own fault, for she\\'s certain that it\\'s Sharpay who alerted Taylor McKessie to Gabriella\\'s past, and that was before Sharpay had any reasonable worry about her. She still shouldn\\'t have any justified reasons to hate her, though, since Gabriella truly only wants to watch the auditions. New Year\\'s Eve was a fluke and her church choir days are long behind her for a very good reason. The fact that she enjoyed that feeling of freedom when she sang with Troy doesn\\'t mean that she wants to get up on stage again. She truly just wants to watch safely from the sidelines instead of becoming the centre of attention. However, judging from the anger that\\'s been growing in Sharpay\\'s eyes with every meeting they\\'ve had, she knows that she doesn\\'t believe a word Gabriella says. And as long as Sharpay is wary of her, Gabriella is catching unwanted attention. Furthermore, she\\'s also catching attention from Troy. She hasn\\'t spoken to him since they ran into each other this morning, but she has seen him in the hallways multiple times, and each time, their eyes have met and she has felt a tidal wave of sparks ripple through her body. She is also afraid of his attention, though, but not at all for the same reason she fears Sharpay. Sharpay scares her because she can destroy Gabriella\\'s life, but Troy has the power to destroy her heart. It scares her that she already has such strong feelings for him, especially when she doesn\\'t know him. The only things she knows about him is that he has incredibly blue eyes, he can sing very well and he makes her feel at ease. She doesn\\'t know anything about his personality, his interests, his goals in life. She shouldn\\'t feel this way about someone is practically a stranger to her. Furthermore, his presence in her life is the reason why she has this inexplicable curiosity about the school musical. His presence is the reason why she acted so foolishly and caught the attention of the one person she should avoid. At least, one good thing has come from it, though. Taylor. Taylor might be pushy about Gabriella joining the decathlon, but she is also smart, friendly and helpful, and she\\'s exactly the kind of friend that Gabriella could use at this school. Sharpay may have set them up with malign intent, but Gabriella is grateful to have Taylor by her side. Perhaps Taylor could also ease her anxieties about the two people who have been plaguing her mind all day. So, when they\\'re walking out of the school at the end of the day, Gabriella decides to just ask. \"What do you know about Troy Bolton?\" Taylor\\'s eyebrows shoot up. \"Troy?\" When Gabriella shrugs and nods, Taylor lets out a laugh. \"Well, I don\\'t particularly like to concern myself with that particular subspecies, but you could say that Troy is a hottie superbomb.\" \"Hottie superbomb?\" Gabriella repeats with an amused giggle as Taylor nods and rolls her eyes. \"I didn\\'t coin that,\" she assures Gabriella, \"but it\\'s a good way to describe him. Other terms would include heartthrob, superstar, king of the campus. You know, all those terms they use to describe basketball captains who have their heads way too far up their asses.\" Gabriella bites her lip. So, Troy is apparently very popular. She probably should have known, with him and his basketball-carrying friend being dragged off by the basketball coach during detention, and the rather extreme school spirit amongst students. Yet she finds it hard to believe that this sweet, dorky boy she\\'s met on New Year\\'s Eve is as arrogant as Taylor says he is. \"He seems kind of nice,\" Gabriella comments, and Taylor scoffs and shakes her head. \"Trust me, he isn\\'t,\" she says firmly, before pointing to the group of cheerleaders standing a yard away from them. \"He only gives the time of day to girls who like to discuss their nailbeds.\" Yet he gave Gabriella the time of day and she\\'s definitely not type of the girl. And even though she can sense that Taylor is biased, this does make her feel insecure. She feels like she can be herself around him, but what if being herself isn\\'t enough? \"Seriously, though, you don\\'t want to befriend Troy Bolton,\" Taylor continues, before pausing briefly and glancing at Gabriella cautiously. \"And you don\\'t want to befriend Sharpay Evans either.\" Gabriella sighs heavily. Just as the detention debacle hasn\\'t left her own thoughts, it\\'s obvious that Taylor hasn\\'t been able to let it go either. \"I\\'m just going to watch the auditions, nothing more,\" Gabriella reassures Taylor, who just purses her lips and shakes her head. \"Look, I\\'m just trying to look out for you,\" she says. \"It\\'s not just that I don\\'t understand your interest, which I don\\'t, but I know Sharpay. Even if you just sit in the audience of the auditions, she will see you as a threat and she will come after you. She\\'s dangerous and you need to be careful.\" There\\'s a sense of genuine worry in Taylor\\'s eyes and Gabriella musters a small, grateful smile in return. \"I will, I promise.\" She doesn\\'t need Taylor to tell her that Sharpay is dangerous, though. She has already figured that out by herself. But for some reason, she just can\\'t help herself. She just hopes that this newfound and irrepressible curiosity about the musical won\\'t cause her demise.'][Chapter 2] ['Sharpay is nervous. She has never felt this jittery feeling before when she has walked into the theatre or when she has gone on stage and grabbed the spotlight. She has been in seventeen school productions in her young life, yet she has never, ever felt nervous for an audition. Until now, that is. Now, the problem isn\\'t the actual audition. She knows the drama club by heart – she practically rules the theatre department. She knows she and Ryan are the only pair who signed up and therefore are practically confirmed to be getting the leads. She knows that she and Ryan are the only talented performers in the club anyways. She knows she has nothing to worry about if the other hopefuls are as dismal as they usually are. But there lies the problem. She isn\\'t so sure whether everyone will be as terrible as always. Sure, Alan will fumble over his words and Cyndra will never get the message that the club isn\\'t interested in opera singers, but they aren\\'t the only people interested in the musical this time around. Gabriella Montez is interested in the musical now. And while Sharpay has tried to convince herself that Gabriella was speaking the truth when she just wanted to watch the auditions and nothing more, and that it isn\\'t clear whether Gabriella can sing anyways, Sharpay is still wary. She\\'s so wary that she can see Ryan\\'s patience wearing thin, his face contorting with more annoyance each time she furtively glances around to make sure that Gabriella isn\\'t present. Fortunately, Ryan doesn\\'t speak up, though – he rarely speaks up to Sharpay beyond an occasional sarcastic remark –, but his annoyance doesn\\'t sit well with her. If she\\'s panicking enough to visibly annoy her brother, her quiet and loyal best friend, it\\'s bad. And the knowledge that her panic is reaching dangerous levels isn\\'t helping her calm down either. \"Are you okay?\" Ryan finally whispers in her ear after a while, and it\\'s not until then that Sharpay realizes she\\'s hyperventilating. This really is bad. However, her panic quickly dissipates as Ms. Darbus enters the auditorium right at that exact moment. Auditions are starting. Gabriella isn\\'t here. The crisis is averted, Sharpay thinks with a sigh of relief. \"Yeah, I\\'m fine.\" Finally feeling the familiar excitement bubble in her stomach, Sharpay watches eagerly as Darbus disposes of her belongings, before walking to the stage with powerful strides. It\\'s the sound of another pair of footsteps entering the auditorium, just before Darbus starts her welcome speech, that makes Sharpay\\'s breath hitch in her throat and her panic return, though. Almost as if in slow motion, she turns around to see her worst nightmare come to life. Gabriella Montez is here. She quickly reverts her gaze to the stage as Gabriella\\'s doe-eyes scan the room, and she hopes that Gabriella won\\'t get the idea that it\\'s okay to come and socialize with her. It\\'s already too late, though, for she hears the footsteps approach as she continues to stare ahead starkly, and suddenly she feels a presence right next to her. \"Hi,\" Gabriella simply greets her, and both twins watch her with wide eyes, Sharpay incredulously and Ryan curiously. There are so many empty seats in the auditorium. She could have sat anywhere. She probably would have been better off in the back if she truly didn\\'t want to watch without intruding. Why is she sitting here? Why does she refuse to take Sharpay\\'s hints that she\\'s not interested in being her friend? Maybe she needs another reminder. \"You came,\" Sharpay says coldly, before turning back to the stage, trying to concentrate on Darbus\\'s words rather than on Gabriella. Gabriella seems to take the hint, for she sounds a little embarrassed as she says, \"Sorry if I\\'m bothering you. I just didn\\'t know anyone else here.\" \"Well, you are bothering us if you\\'re not quiet,\" Sharpay responds curtly, scooting a little to the left as she feels her body tense at Gabriella\\'s presence to her right. Gabriella sighs and thankfully, she does as she\\'s told for once, settling down as she focuses on the stage as well. They remain quiet for a minute, before Ryan suddenly speaks up. \"We haven\\'t met yet,\" he says, sticking his hand out to Gabriella. \"Ryan Evans. I\\'m Sharpay\\'s brother.\" From the corner of her eye, she can see Gabriella\\'s face light up, a happy sparkle suddenly evident in her eyes, as she takes Ryan\\'s hand and shakes it. \"Gabriella Montez. Nice to meet you.\" As Ryan retracts his hand, Sharpay shoots him an incredulous look and he furrows his eyebrows as he shrugs in response. \"What?\" Of course he doesn\\'t get it. He has only met Gabriella just now and he\\'s not nearly as perceptive as Sharpay is. He doesn\\'t understand yet that there\\'s a danger hidden beneath that sparkle in her dark eyes. He\\'s not aware yet that Gabriella Montez poses a threat. Sharpay just shakes her head and turns back to the stage again, the scowl never leaving her face as the first candidate is called to the stage. And, as she remains hyperaware of Gabriella\\'s proximity, the panic and the nerves never leave. The auditions have certainly been interesting so far. Between Ms. Darbus\\'s harsh commentary on the performers, most of whom are alarmingly bad, and Sharpay\\'s icy demeanour, Gabriella wonders why she thought it would be a good idea to visit. Yet the fascination never ceases, even as she watches performers mess up their lines and sing off-key, and the memory of herself being on stage on New Year\\'s Eve never quite leaves her mind. She would never actually do it, but a part of her wonders what it would be like if she actually did audition, what it would be like to feel that exhilarating feeling of being on stage again. To be honest, she craves that feeling again. However, she lets the rational part take reign, for she does not want to be subjected to Ms. Darbus\\'s criticism and Sharpay\\'s scrutiny. So, she watches, and watches, and watches, until suddenly, the single\\'s auditions are over. \"Before we move on the pair\\'s auditions, are there any last-minute sign-ups for the single\\'s?\" Darbus\\'s voice calls, and the tiny flame inside Gabriella\\'s heart suddenly flickers to life. She hears Sharpay\\'s breath hitch beside her and she gulps as she looks to her left to catch the diva\\'s glare. Gabriella has become accustomed to her glare over past two days, and she recognizes that the look in Sharpay\\'s eyes is now quite different than before. It\\'s not disdain or fury – it\\'s a warning. It\\'s telling her not to dare. Somehow, it only spurs Gabriella on. She has come here with a desire to be true to herself, not to be pushed into a box, and she\\'s not going to let Sharpay or anyone else limit her. She\\'s not going to let her life be led by fear any longer. So, she stands up. \"I\\'d like to audition, Ms. Darbus.\" Every single person in the auditorium, from the stage crew and the other candidates to Ms. Darbus and the Evans twins, turns around and suddenly, Gabriella realizes she has made a mistake after all. She might not want to limit herself, but opening herself up means that she\\'s going to have to go up there. And sing. While she has stage fright. \"Ms. Montez,\" Ms. Darbus states, although it sounds more like a question. \"Please come up here.\" Sharpay huffs indignantly, and Gabriella spares her an apologetic glance before slowly making her way to the stage, her knees trembling beneath her as she feels the many pairs of eyes on her. When she\\'s on stage, the mousy, bespectacled pianist – Kelsi is her name, Gabriella believes – immediately steps towards her and hands her the sheet music with a kind smile. Gabriella quickly glances over it and gulps again, before offering Kelsi a nervous smile. \"It\\'ll be fine,\" Kelsi whispers, and Gabriella is grateful for her encouragement, even though she can\\'t see how this could possibly be true. \"Any time you\\'re ready, Ms. Montez,\" Ms. Darbus encourages her, but her stern tone doesn\\'t make Gabriella feel at ease. Slowly nodding, she turns to face the audience and she almost decides to quit. But then she sees it, or rather him , in the far back of the auditorium, hiding behind a mop. His face is pale and his eyes are wide as he stares at her, and she\\'s suddenly transported back to New Year\\'s Eve, when those same eyes, so warm and blue, gave her the courage to continue singing and to let go of her fears. Then, she spares another glance at Sharpay, whose eyes are still hard and furious, and she feels determined. She\\'s not going to let Sharpay get her down. And, as she glances back at Troy, she feels her worries wash away. The determination that Sharpay has instilled in her and the comfort that Troy\\'s presence offers, are a powerful combination. She can do this. So, she shuts her eyes briefly and lets out a heavy breath, and then she starts singing and watches as Sharpay\\'s eyes widen in horror and her brother\\'s mouth falls agape. Somehow, she manages to get through it without hyperventilating, becoming nauseous or nearly fainting. All because of those two pairs of eyes, so starkly different from one another, focused on her. As she finishes, Darbus is glaring at her curiously, and she feels the nerves overcome her again as she braces herself for what will surely be scathing criticism. However, it never comes. Instead, Darbus merely scribbles something down and tells her, \"Thank you, Ms. Montez.\" There\\'s no hint of disapproval in her voice, like there\\'s been for nearly every single candidate, and Gabriella can\\'t help but blink astonished at the lack of negative feedback, before quickly handing back her sheet music to the pianist, who is still smiling at her warmly. Then, she hurries off stage to return to her seat, where she slumps down as Darbus calls for Ryan and Sharpay to come up, and Sharpay nearly kicks her in the shin as she moves past her. She honestly wishes she could disappear when Sharpay\\'s gaze remains steadfastly on her throughout their performance, the fury in her eyes reaching heights that Gabriella hadn\\'t thought to be possible. However, despite Sharpay\\'s obvious distraction by Gabriella\\'s audition – as evidenced by Sharpay messing up a dance move and bumping into Ryan at one point during the song –, the siblings are good. They truly shine on stage, and Gabriella truly doesn\\'t think she could ever measure up to their talent. Sharpay Evans isn\\'t only an ice queen, but she\\'s also a star. That knowledge makes Gabriella wonder why she put herself like this, why she put that target on her back, but still, she doesn\\'t regret it. She will be subjected to Sharpay\\'s cruelty, no matter what the outcome of this audition, but it\\'s worth it. Because for once, she was true to herself. For once, she was more than the freaky math girl. And maybe, just maybe, she can be free here. When Ms. Darbus dismisses everyone, Gabriella all but rushes out of her seat in an attempt to avoid Sharpay, who has yet to stop glaring at her menacingly. Quickly hurrying to the back of the theatre, she puts her hand on her hip as she raises her eyebrow playfully at the person who is still hiding behind it. \"You auditioned,\" are the first words from his mouth, and her playful demeanour immediately evaporates as she hears an emotion akin to agony in his voice. She bites her lip as she nods. \"I did.\" An awkward silence settles between them as they just stare at each other, unsure what to say as they try to come to terms with what just happened. She just did the exact thing she wasn\\'t supposed to do. She just went far beyond the limits of what East High\\'s social norms dictate. She just did something… different. It\\'s terrifying and exciting all at once for Gabriella, but judging from the distraught storm brewing in Troy\\'s eyes, he\\'s only terrified. \"Why did you do that?\" Troy finally asks, but his tone is not accusatorily. Instead, he seems genuinely curious. Gabriella shrugs. \"The same reason you\\'re hiding behind that mop.\" Troy smiles sheepishly as he lets go of the mop. \"That\\'s a fair point.\" They\\'re silent for a moment again, before Troy\\'s cheeks suddenly redden and his hand flies up to his neck. \"You know, I really admire you for going up there.\" Gabriella feels her own face grow hot in response as she musters a shy smile. \"Thanks. Why didn\\'t you? You\\'re obviously interested.\" When Troy averts his gaze nervously, she feels overcome with a pleasant feeling of affection as she realizes what is going on. Teasingly, she asks, \"Is the Wildcats superstar afraid?\" Troy chuckles meekly. \"No, I\\'m not afraid. I\\'m just… scared.\" He gestures to the stage, where only Sharpay and that Kelsi girl seem to be left. Gabriella watches with narrowed eyes as Sharpay shouts something at Kelsi, obviously using her as a proxy for Gabriella, before swiftly turning around and marching off the stage angrily. \"I get it,\" Gabriella says as she nervously fiddles with her hands. \"I\\'m pretty sure I pissed off a lot of people today.\" A fond grin grows on Troy\\'s face as she turns back to him. \"Well, you were really good, so if they don\\'t want you, that\\'s their loss.\" Feeling a flutter in her stomach, Gabriella returns his smile, grateful for his comfort, both at this moment and during the audition. \"Thanks,\" she says, and she hopes that he knows just how grateful she truly is. They stay like that for a moment, grinning at each other goofily, before a sudden, loud crash brings them back to reality. Swiftly turning around, Gabriella feels a tug at her heart as she watches Kelsi sit on the stage forlornly. She looks like she\\'s about to cry as papers are scattered all over the floor around her. She needs help. Troy and Gabriella seem to have the same idea, because they simultaneously start a sprint towards the stage. As they start collecting papers for her, Kelsi watches them both, but especially Troy, with wide eyes. \"So, you\\'re the composer?\" Troy asks her. \"You wrote the audition song?\" Kelsi nods silently, and Troy smiles as he reaches out his hand, helping her up. \"It was really lovely,\" Gabriella comments, and Kelsi\\'s face lights up as her gaze moves from Troy to her. \"Thank you!\" she exclaims as a brilliant grin breaks out on her face. \"Your voice is really lovely, too.\" Gabriella blushes as she shyly looks down. \"Thanks. It definitely helps when you have a good song to sing. Actually, I liked your slow version a lot better than that up-tempo arrangement that Ryan and Sharpay did.\" \"Thank you!\" The combination of Kelsi\\'s excitement with regard to such a small compliment and the earlier interaction between her and Sharpay makes Gabriella wonder. Sharpay has power and is willing to destroy anyone who doesn\\'t do exactly what she wants, that much is obvious. But how far does Sharpay\\'s power over the drama club extend exactly? How horribly does Sharpay treat those who oppose her? Why has no one stepped up to her? Troy obviously seems to have similar thoughts, for he asks Kelsi, \"Why are you so afraid of Ryan and Sharpay?\" As Kelsi just shrugs in response, he continues, \"It\\'s your show, right?\" Kelsi\\'s eyebrows furrow in response. \"It is?\" \"Well, yeah,\" Troy says, shrugging. \"You\\'re like the playmaker in basketball. You\\'re the one who makes everyone else look good. Without you, there\\'s no show.\" At his encouraging words, Gabriella can\\'t help but think back to her conversation with Taylor yesterday. Troy is not at all like what Taylor said he would be. He\\'s so kind, so encouraging to this girl he barely knows, this girl who would probably never be in the vicinity of his social circles. Although he says he\\'s afraid of trying new things and he says he envies her for opening herself up, he\\'s still so open, but just in a different way than her. She really likes that about him. Although they come from different backgrounds, they\\'re really the same. \"I don\\'t know, Ryan and Sharpay are pretty keen on things going their way,\" Kelsi snaps Gabriella from her thoughts. \"I never get much of a say.\" If there\\'s anything Gabriella doesn\\'t like, it\\'s injustice. Suddenly overcome with resentment for the bedazzled twins, she feels that same determination that she felt when she auditioned bubble inside her. Even though she\\'s drawing attention to herself, she hopes she will get a part in the musical, because she wants to fight. Not only for herself, but for Kelsi and the other members of the drama club, too. \"If I get a part, I\\'ll be on your side,\" she reassures Kelsi, and they share a smile. \"Thanks,\" Kelsi replies earnestly. \"I\\'m sure you will get cast. Your audition really was good.\" Then, she holds out her hand. \"I\\'m Kelsi, by the way. Kelsi Nielsen.\" \"Gabriella Montez,\" Gabriella replies, shaking her head firmly and feeling a slight relief wash over her as she realizes she has someone on her side against Sharpay now. Whatever Sharpay\\'s reckoning will be, she won\\'t have to face it alone. \"I\\'m Troy Bolton,\" Troy introduces himself, and Kelsi blushes as she shakes his hand, too. \"I know who you are,\" she says with a laugh, before bending down and picking up the last of her papers. As she stands up again, she looks back and forth between Troy and Gabriella and then smiles softly. \"Thank you. Really.\" And as Troy and Gabriella glance at each other and share a smile of their own, Gabriella feels an excited flutter in her stomach. She may have done it on a whim, but she truly made the right decision to audition. She truly made the right decision to stand up. \"Sharpay, breathe.\" Sharpay lets out a heavy breath through her nostrils as she hears the mixture of annoyance and concern in her brother\\'s voice, and continues pacing around her bedroom. She knows she\\'s being overdramatic – she\\'s Sharpay Evans after all –, but she can\\'t be calm and breathe when her life was just ruined. Or, well, it was changed , but not for the better. Gabriella Montez did the unthinkable. She auditioned, despite Sharpay\\'s schemes and snide remarks to prevent her from doing just that. Moreover, Gabriella Montez is good . Sharpay would have been pissed either way, because she seriously doesn\\'t like the girl, but the fact that she can actually carry a tune makes her a genuine threat, which is exactly what Sharpay was afraid of. Of course, Sharpay won\\'t have to worry about losing the lead, seeing as Gabriella auditioned alone, but that doesn\\'t make it any less bad. The fact remains that Gabriella auditioned and will likely get a part, being one of the few, if not the only, good candidate for the single\\'s auditions, and change and new people in the drama club never bode well. There\\'s also the fact that Gabriella looked straight into Sharpay\\'s eyes for most of the audition, as if to challenge her, and that unnerves her. She already had a hunch the girl\\'s shy demeanour was just a façade, but to see it confirmed, Sharpay feels furious and threatened. She needs to do something, anything to stop Gabriella from joining the drama club, but for once, Sharpay has no idea where to start. Now that Gabriella has auditioned and obviously caught Ms. Darbus\\'s attention, she might be too late. Feeling her brother\\'s soft hand land on her shoulder in comfort, Sharpay shrugs it off with a groan of frustration. \"How dare she? Everyone knows that Ms. Darbus just calls for last minute sign-ups as a formality. She shouldn\\'t have allowed it.\" Ryan sits down on her bed as he purses his lips thoughtfully. \"Everyone has a right to audition.\" Sharpay just narrows her eyes at him. \"Whose side are you on?!\" Ryan scrambles up as he grabs her shoulders to steady her. \"Yours. I\\'m always on your side. I just don\\'t see what\\'s the problem if we got some new talent in the drama club. Lord knows we need it.\" Sharpay huffs and releases herself from his grip, shaking her head profusely as she starts pacing again. \"But that\\'s exactly the problem. She\\'s talented , Ryan. That means she might be a threat to us!\" As Ryan narrows his eyebrows in confusion, she rolls her eyes and continues, \"All those losers in drama club look up to us, because we\\'re better than they could ever dream of being. She won\\'t. She will think she can challenge us, and considering she\\'s obviously inexperienced, she will ruin the entire show.\" \"How do you know she\\'s inexperienced?\" Sharpay rolls her eyes again. She loves Ryan, she does, but sometimes he can be so imperceptive. \"Did you see how nervous she was? That girl is not used to being on stage.\" Ryan lets out a thoughtful sound as he contemplates her words, before shrugging and letting himself fall back on the bed again, putting his hands behind his head as he stares up at the ceiling. \"She seems nice, though. I don\\'t think she\\'ll be out for us.\" Sharpay scoffs, those sparkling brown eyes flashing before her again. \"You don\\'t know her.\" Ryan might be fooled by Gabriella\\'s innocent smile, but Sharpay isn\\'t. \"Well, you don\\'t know her either,\" Ryan counters, as he spares a quick glance at her. \"Why do you care so much about her?\" That makes Sharpay falter in her step for a second, before she resumes pacing to keep up appearances. That\\'s a good question, actually. She could repeat everything she\\'s just said again, about the threat to the drama club, but she knows there is something else. There\\'s something that unnerves her about this girl\\'s entire being, and she can\\'t put a finger on what is, which only unnerves her even further. She can\\'t stand it that this girl is intruding on her drama club, but she can\\'t stand it even more that she can\\'t figure out what it is about her that affects her so much. \"I just told you, she\\'s going to threaten our power,\" she merely answers Ryan\\'s question and he sighs in response. \"Who knows, maybe you\\'re worrying for nothing,\" he tries to encourage her. \"Maybe she won\\'t get a part.\" Sharpay stops in her tracks to send him an incredulous glare. \"You and I both know that she will.\" Ryan shrugs. \"Well, then we\\'ll just wait and see. Try to be optimistic. Maybe it won\\'t be so bad. Maybe you\\'ll even get a new friend.\" Sharpay scoffs at Ryan\\'s teasing tone, before shaking her head. She and Gabriella Montez will never be friends. Not as long as this girl is messing up her life.'][Chapter 3] ['Friday morning, a loud-pitched scream is heard throughout the entire school. Gabriella has just arrived, walking through the hallways when she hears it, and she blinks in confusion and alarm as she tries to find its source. She feels her breath hitch as she sees Sharpay and Ryan at the bulletin board, their backs turned to her. The cast list has been posted. Quickly, she pushes herself up against the wall in attempt to hide from them. If Sharpay\\'s desperate scream is anything to go by, there\\'s a good chance that Gabriella got a part. And while the very notion of that excites her, she\\'s scared as well. Scared of Sharpay and her inevitable wrath, and scared of the school finding out that she\\'s been colouring outside the lines. Besides the people who were present at the audition, not a single soul knows about what she did. She hasn\\'t told Taylor or her mom, and no one in the drama club – not even Sharpay – seems to have said anything, because she has remained invisible to the other students for the rest of the week. She might have received a noticeably more gentle treatment from Darbus, and Sharpay may have given her more death glares than she can count, but up until now, she has still been the invisible, shy new girl. That is about to change. \"This isn\\'t real! This can\\'t be happening!\" Gabriella hears Sharpay shout at her brother, her arms flailing around dramatically, and Gabriella feels her heart speed up as a fearful shiver slides down her spine. This isn\\'t going to end well. As determined as she is to fight injustice in the drama club and to stand up to Sharpay for people like Kelsi, she can\\'t deny just how intimidating Sharpay Evans is and how much she dreads the diva\\'s brutal behaviour that will surely be aimed at her. At least her brother seems unfazed by the news, though, standing calmly and unwavering as Sharpay shouts at him, and that fills Gabriella with some relief. Ryan might be Sharpay\\'s twin, but he seems nice enough, and he doesn\\'t seem to resent her as much as Sharpay does. That means there\\'s at least one less person to worry about. Gabriella gulps as suddenly a group of boys, led by Troy\\'s friend with the afro, appear behind the twins. She might not have to worry about Ryan, but something tells her she probably will have to worry about these guys. \"What\\'s up?\" she can hear Troy\\'s friend ask Sharpay, his tone amused, and Sharpay just turns around and pouts at the group of boys, before pointing to the cast list. Troy\\'s friend leans closer, but he doesn\\'t say anything. Instead, he just shrugs, and he and his friends move on right away. As the boys have disappeared, Ryan puts his hands on Sharpay\\'s shoulders. \"It will be okay, sis.\" Something tells Gabriella that is not true, and Sharpay obviously seems to share this sentiment, for she just stomps her foot and breaks free from his grasp, before marching off. Ryan glances one more time at the cast list, and then shakes his head and follows his sister out of sight. Gabriella waits a minute, and as soon as she\\'s sure she won\\'t be spotted, she quickly hurries over the bulletin board to read the cast list. She lets out a huge breath as her eyes scan over the words. The leads, Arnold and Minnie, have gone to Ryan and Sharpay, as expected, but next to the third character on the list, Mary, she sees her own name. Gabriella Montez. She has just been cast in the school musical. She would be lying if she didn\\'t expect it, judging from Kelsi\\'s enthusiasm after the audition and Sharpay\\'s freak-out that she just witnessed, but she still feels pride and confidence rush through her as her eyes remain fixated on that one line that means so much more to her than a mere casting. She, Gabriella Montez, is more than the freaky math girl. She\\'s capable of being more than she thought she was, and that knowledge is liberating. And when she is walking down the hallways later, she incidentally meets Troy\\'s eyes and he winks at her, she can\\'t help but remember their conversation after the auditions, and think about how much he admired her for putting herself out there. She may have made a powerful enemy, and Sharpay may make her life in drama club hell, but it\\'s worth it. If she can take control of her own fate, all the terrible things will always be worth it. Gabriella has been avoiding the Evans twins all day. Every time she sees them approaching, she attempts to hide in the most ridiculous of ways. She even found out there\\'s a group of car mechanics working in the school, which is both baffling and amazing to her. She also almost arrived late to homeroom, in the hopes that Ryan and Sharpay wouldn\\'t pester her before the start of class, which didn\\'t seem to please Ms. Darbus, and probably only drew attention to her. However, she knows it\\'s no good to keep avoiding the twins. She\\'s going to have to face them eventually, and she\\'d rather have it be before rehearsals start, so they can start with a clear conscience. Now, she\\'s no fool, she knows that Sharpay won\\'t accept any apology from her, but she wants to at least talk to them, assure them that she\\'s just as dedicated to making a good show as they are, if not just for her own peace of mind. So, when it\\'s lunch time, she decides to take the leap. Walking into the cafeteria with her tray of food, she takes a shaky, deep breath and shakes her head as Taylor waves her over, instead looking up to see Sharpay, Ryan and Kelsi sitting on the upper floor of the cafeteria. Her legs trembling beneath her frame, she decides to go for it, climbing the stairs slowly, feeling several pairs of eyes on her as she ascends the stairs – Taylor\\'s, Sharpay\\'s, Ryan\\'s, Kelsi\\'s, probably Troy\\'s and his friends\\'. Part of her knows that what she\\'s doing is wrong – not only is she not adhering to the social rules by going up there, but facing Sharpay has also the potential to make the blonde\\'s vendetta against her even worse. Yet she keeps a straight face and ignores the beating of her heart against her ribcage as she arrives at the top of the stairs. Gulping, she slowly makes her way over to the Evans twins and Kelsi, who are all watching her with mouths agape. \"Hi,\" she says, a little nervously, and she averts her gaze as Sharpay\\'s mouth snaps shut and her eyes narrow in a vicious glare. \"What are you doing here?\" Sharpay asks rudely, and Gabriella shrugs. \"I just wanted to talk to you about the cast list,\" she says quietly, and Sharpay raises her eyebrows. \"Are you here to celebrate that you got a role? Are you expecting me to congratulate you? Because if so, I\\'m sorry to break it to you, but this is not a one-woman show. There\\'s several other people who got roles as well, my brother and myself included, and we actually got bigger parts than you. You\\'re not that special.\" Gabriella\\'s eyes snap up again, meeting Sharpay\\'s furious gaze, and she shakes her head as she takes a step closer, watching Sharpay\\'s face twitch in response. \"No, that isn\\'t why I\\'m here. I just wanted to let you know that I can\\'t wait to work with you.\" \"The feeling is not mutual,\" Sharpay replies curtly before resuming her attention to her tray and scrunching her face as she picks up a bite of food with a fork and then drops on the plate again. When Gabriella doesn\\'t move, she looks up again and waves her hand at her. \"Now, bye-bye.\" This should have been the end of it. This would have been a perfect end to it. No dramatic breakdowns or humiliating experiences. Just a curt conversation, where Gabriella had her say and Sharpay made a couple of snide remarks in response. Yet there\\'s something that bothers Gabriella. She\\'s not surprised that Sharpay has refused to be civil, but she is bothered by it. She may not like Sharpay and her unjust treatment of the other members of drama club, but she wants – no, she needs – Sharpay to know that she means the drama club no harm, even if she refuses to listen to what she says. So, she takes another step forward. And that\\'s when it all comes crumbling down. It seems like someone spilled something on the floor, because before she knows it, she\\'s tripping and the entire content of her tray is spilled on Sharpay Evans\\'s chest. Her responding high-pitched scream is possibly even worse than this morning, and Gabriella feels herself freeze as suddenly every single pair of eyes in the cafeteria is on her. Quickly, she scrambles forward and mutters profuse apologies as she starts wiping at Sharpay\\'s neck, careful to avoid her chest, while Sharpay struggles against her as she continues to scream. Amidst the chaos and humiliation, Gabriella notices that Sharpay\\'s skin is really soft. What a strange thing to think about right now. As she continues wiping and Sharpay continues struggling, Gabriella suddenly feels a pair of arms around her waist, pulling her back. Looking back, she sees a wide-eyed Taylor, and as Taylor notions towards the exit with her head, Gabriella quickly nods and follows. As she and Taylor hurry out of the cafeteria, she catches Troy\\'s eyes for a quick glimpse, his gaze thoughtful and pitiful. Just before she and Taylor exit, she suddenly hears Ms. Darbus\\'s bellowing voice. \"What is going on here?!\" Sharpay, who has now stopped screaming, answers, \"Gabriella Montez dumped her lunch on me! On purpose!\" Gabriella closes her eyes and sighs. If Sharpay didn\\'t hate her before, she surely does now, and she wouldn\\'t even blame her. Her life just got even more complicated than it already is. However, she has no time to dwell on it and throw herself a pity party, for Taylor has dragged her to the restroom and is now glaring at her. \"You auditioned?!\" Gabriella suddenly feels small under Taylor\\'s scrutinizing gaze as she shrugs and tries to act casual. \"Yeah, I did.\" As Taylor just shakes her head incredulously, Gabriella quickly adds, \"I\\'m still going to come to a scholastic decathlon meeting, I promise!\" \"That\\'s not what I care about,\" Taylor snaps, and Gabriella frowns. As she opens her mouth to respond, Taylor shakes her head again. \"I also don\\'t really care that much about the status quo. What I do care about is you.\" That actually makes Gabriella smile. She may have only known Taylor for a short amount of time, but she has truly become something like a friend over the past few days. There\\'s actually someone who cares for her, besides her mother, and that feels good. That being said, Taylor is being silly. There\\'s nothing to be concerned about. \"You don\\'t have to worry about me, I\\'ll be fine,\" Gabriella insists, and Taylor rolls her eyes in response. \"I heard most of your conversation with Sharpay before you spilled your lunch on her and caused a scene. You can\\'t possibly think that went well,\" Taylor retorts, and Gabriella feels herself flush with embarrassment. \"She really hates me, doesn\\'t she?\" Taylor face softens at Gabriella\\'s small voice, and she lays a comforting hand on her friend\\'s shoulder. \"Sharpay would gladly throw her own brother under the bus if that\\'s what she needs to do to win. It\\'s nothing personal, she just doesn\\'t enjoy getting beaten out.\" \"But I didn\\'t beat her out,\" Gabriella insists, almost desperately. \"She got the lead, I only got a supporting role.\" Taylor purses her lips contemplatively. \"Are you a good singer?\" Gabriella blinks and averts her gaze as she thinks back to the audition, to Sharpay\\'s look of horror and Darbus\\'s mildly impressed face, before shrugging. \"I guess I\\'m decent.\" \"Then there\\'s your answer. If you\\'re the least bit decent, she will feel threatened by you.\" That makes Gabriella muster a small smile. She already knew that, but it feels weirdly satisfying to hear it be confirmed by someone else. Sharpay thinks she\\'s good. Sharpay feels threatened by her. For once, Gabriella isn\\'t the one who is constantly threatened by the pretty blonde girl. For once, the roles are reversed. And that feels good. \"Like I said the other day, you need to careful around her, okay?\" Taylor says warningly, and Gabriella can\\'t wipe the smile off her face as she nods solemnly. \"Okay.\" When the day has come to an end, and it seems like the stares that have been aimed at her since lunch are finally over, Gabriella finds a note in her locker, containing directions to a secret stairwell on to the roof. She has her suspicions about who sent it, and she can\\'t help but smile as she reads the note again, memorizing the directions, and goes off to follow them. When she runs up the stairwell, she\\'s blown away by what she finds up there. There are gorgeous, colourful plants everywhere, and the view over the mountaintops is stunning. This is a good way to end the day. \"It\\'s like a jungle up here!\" she exclaims as she faces the smiling figure standing by the railing. Troy. \"Yeah, it\\'s a bit like the cafeteria after that little mishap,\" he says, his eyes widening immeasurably as an embarrassed blush rises to Gabriella\\'s cheeks. \"Yeah, I humiliated myself into the next century,\" she agrees, and Troy shakes his head fervently. \"No, it really wasn\\'t that bad,\" he reassures her. \"All my friends had forgotten about it by the time we got to sixth period.\" Gabriella gulps and nods in response, before pursing her lips. \"I\\'m sure Sharpay hasn\\'t forgotten about it.\" Troy sighs in response, and shrugs as he waves around. \"I figured you\\'d be upset. That\\'s why I showed you this place. I figured you\\'d need it.\" Gabriella can\\'t help but muster a small smile, the first since she and Taylor had their heart-to-heart in the bathroom. Averting her gaze shyly, she walks over to the bench that\\'s seated near the railing and sits down, hands folded neatly in her lap. \"Thank you,\" she says sincerely. \"This place is really beautiful.\" \"Yeah,\" Troy sighs wistfully. \"I come here when I\\'m overwhelmed and need to clear my mind.\" Gabriella narrows her eyes curiously. \"And what are the things that overwhelm you?\" Troy chuckles and looks down at his hands on the railing. \"So many things. There\\'s a lot of pressure on me, being the captain of the basketball team, and being the coach\\'s son.\" There\\'s a crack in his voice when he says the word son , and Gabriella\\'s heart clenches as she realizes he must have a strained relationship with his father. As much as she resents that her mother is constantly being transferred, she could never imagine her mother putting so much pressure on her, or treating her like a brain rather than as her daughter. Before she can say anything, offer any consoling words, Troy continues, \"My parents\\' friends are always talking about how I\\'m such a good player and how my parents must be so proud, and my own friends can\\'t talk about anything other than the upcoming games. It\\'s tiring. I want to be more than just the basketball guy.\" She and Troy are just the same, she realizes. The reason why she originally wanted to blend into the crowd at East High and why she ended up auditioning on a whim is that she wanted to be something more, something different. She just wanted to be herself instead of the freaky math girl, just like how he wants to be himself instead of the basketball guy. \"I know what you mean,\" she responds as Troy has gone silent, staring ahead thoughtfully. \"I\\'ve always been the freaky math girl,\" she explains when his head snaps to her, his gaze curious. \"When I came here, I decided that I wanted to be myself for once. And I guess it worked, because when I was auditioning, I wasn\\'t the freaky math girl. I was just a girl.\" Troy suddenly grins mischievously. \"You even looked like a girl!\" As she rolls her eyes, he laughs and comes to sit next to her, his eyes serious again. \"You really were brave for doing that. Even if Sharpay hates you for it.\" Gabriella smiles as she tucks a strand of hair behind her ear bashfully. \"You should have auditioned, too. I know it\\'s scary, but it really does feel good to just be yourself.\" As Troy grimaces in response, she offers him a sympathetic smile. \"And if you\\'re worried that your friends won\\'t think you\\'re cool anymore, then they\\'re not worth it. Because the way you treated Kelsi and the way you sang with me, that\\'s what makes you cool. Not basketball.\" Troy blinks in response, averting his gaze and staring off into space for a second, before smiling meekly. \"I think the same goes for you,\" he says as their eyes meet again, and Gabriella feels warmth rush through her frame as she realizes it\\'s not only what he needs to hear, but also what she needs to hear. She and Troy really are the same, and it feels so, so good to have someone who understands her fears and her desires. Moreover, it makes her feel like she\\'s not only doing the musical for herself, but also for him. And while this should be a huge pressure, it isn\\'t. It just inspires her even more, to know that she\\'s not only fighting for herself, but also for someone else. It makes all the worries worth it. Averting her gaze, she stares at the mountaintops and feels the worries glide off her at the tranquil sight. \"Hey, if you want to come here more often, you\\'re welcome to,\" Troy says, obviously noticing her calmness, and she smiles gratefully in response. \"Thanks. Maybe I will,\" she says, keeping her eyes focused on the view as a slow smile blossoms on her lips. She may have humiliated herself today, but as she looks at this terrific view and listens to Troy\\'s calm breathing, her mind is cleared and she finds that she doesn\\'t care about the cafeteria mishap anymore. Sharpay may never believe her, but she\\'s truly excited to explore this new world of the stage and to help the musical become a great success. And she can\\'t wait to start. A/N: Please leave a review if you like the story! I\\'m very interested to hear your thoughts!'][Chapter 4] ['During the first rehearsal, Gabriella decides that it\\'s best if she stays in the background and doesn\\'t draw much attention to herself. It\\'s the logical choice, given that she\\'s inexperienced and still needs to learn a lot about how musical rehearsals work, and also considering the fact that Sharpay is probably still furious with her and would be willing to murder her for even the slightest mishap. Moreover, she finds it interesting just to observe for a while before she gets more involved. She just wants to see what the drama club is like and get a sense of who these new people surrounding her are, before she can build up any confidence to draw attention to herself again. Therefore, when she arrives in the auditorium for rehearsal, she gulps when she sees the circle of chairs on stage. She feels nervous that she doesn\\'t have the safety guard of staying away from the stage, but choosing a seat that\\'s furthest out of Ms. Darbus\\'s direct line of sight, she figures she can be as invisible as she wants. Staying out of Ms. Darbus\\'s periphery also helps her avoid the Evans twins. Unlike at the auditions, when she approached them, she wants to stay away from them as far as possible, to avoid confrontation. Sharpay hasn\\'t talked to her or raged at her since what happened between them on Friday. Instead, she\\'s given her the cold shoulder, which surprises Gabriella, given Sharpay\\'s apparent bad temper, but it simultaneously fills her with a bit of relief. If she could choose between being yelled at and being ignored, she\\'d much rather choose the latter option. Of course, she knows the cold shoulder won\\'t last forever and Sharpay\\'s anger will reach a boiling point eventually, but Gabriella would rather avoid thinking of that inevitably as long as Sharpay keeps up her current attitude. Sharpay and her brother arrive to the auditorium just a few minutes after Gabriella, and Gabriella feels dreadful as Sharpay\\'s eyes lock on her immediately. Maybe when she\\'s at a place where she holds more power than Gabriella in every way – being the president, being more experienced, being the lead actress –, Sharpay will finally feel like she can rip Gabriella a new one. It doesn\\'t happen. There\\'s still that ever present fury in her eyes, but Sharpay just averts her gaze after a second and huffs indignantly as she sits down on a chair outside of Gabriella\\'s line of sight, her head held high. Ryan grimaces at Gabriella, before following his sister, and Gabriella slumps in her seat as she lets out a sigh. It\\'s only a matter of time. At least Ms. Darbus seems to be in a cheerful mood, smiling from ear to ear as she welcomes everyone to her so-called hallowed hall and asks Kelsi to hand out scripts to everyone. When Kelsi arrives at Gabriella\\'s seat and hands her the scripts, she smiles. \"I\\'m glad you\\'re here,\" she whispers, and Gabriella can\\'t help but return her smile, once again reminded of why she\\'s here and why she\\'s brought the wrath of someone like Sharpay Evans upon herself. She\\'s here to fight. For herself, for Kelsi, for Troy. And, when they\\'re all going reading through the script together for the first time, she realizes that it\\'s really necessary. It\\'s almost jarring, how often Sharpay offers commentary and Kelsi slumps back in her seat as Ms. Darbus goes along with Sharpay\\'s suggestions without second thought. It\\'s similarly jarring how no one else, not even Ryan, the other lead, or Kelsi, the writer and composer, seems to have suggestions at all. Sharpay has Ms. Darbus and the drama club completely under her control. When they arrive at the scene where the leads sing What I\\'ve Been Looking For , the audition song, Gabriella\\'s aggravation with Sharpay has reached great heights, and it doesn\\'t help that it appears that Ms. Darbus intends to use her sped-up version of the song instead of Kelsi\\'s original. So, when Sharpay raises her hand again, Gabriella almost rolls her eyes. \"Something doesn\\'t seem to be working here,\" the blonde says as she narrows her eyes on the script thoughtfully. \"Arnold and Minnie are still so tentative around each other at this point. It doesn\\'t make sense that they would break into song right now and sing about their feelings to each other so confidently.\" Her point does make sense, Gabriella thinks, but as she looks at Kelsi, who looks like she might start crying at any moment, she remembers how lovely and vulnerable the song sounded in the slower arrangement. Of course it doesn\\'t work in the current version, because the arrangement is all wrong. She watches Ms. Darbus carefully as the older woman taps her chin thoughtfully, before nodding. \"You\\'re right, Ms. Evans. Maybe we should move the song to a different place in the play.\" \"Or maybe we should get rid of it altogether!\" Gabriella\\'s eyebrows raise incredulously as she notices the gleeful glint in Sharpay\\'s eyes. Why would she want to remove this song? It\\'s a good song, no matter which arrangement is used. It makes no sense to get rid of it. There should be other solutions. She\\'s so flabbergasted about Sharpay\\'s suggestion that she barely thinks before speaking up. \"What if we used Kelsi\\'s original arrangement instead?\" All eyes turn to her, and Gabriella gulps as she remembers how that same thing happened last Friday, and how that ended for her. As Ms. Darbus motions for her to keep talking, Gabriella fiddles with her fingers, before explaining, \"Well, the problem is that it feels too open and confident. In the original arrangement, the song is much smaller and more vulnerable. A smaller song would make much more sense.\" Gabriella doesn\\'t dare to look at Sharpay, who is most likely furious, but when she instead looks at Kelsi, who is now smiling brightly, she suddenly feels a lot more confident as her gaze returns to Ms. Darbus to gauge her reaction. \"That\\'s actually a good point, Ms. Montez,\" Ms. Darbus concedes after a moment of contemplation. \"I think we should do it.\" While both Gabriella and Kelsi grin brightly in response, Sharpay suddenly lets out a furious grunt as she stands up and marches over to Ms. Darbus. \"Are you seriously letting someone with so little experience decide what we\\'re doing?\" she all but shouts as she points to Gabriella, who feels her cheeks warm up with embarrassment. The cold shoulder is over. Sharpay is erupting. Ms. Darbus doesn\\'t seem to be impressed by Sharpay\\'s rage, though. Calmly, she states, \"It was a good idea. And don\\'t you want what\\'s best for the musical?\" \"Of course I do,\" Sharpay says, before turning to glare viciously at Gabriella. \"But I have my doubts about her intentions. I told you in the cafeteria on Friday, Ms. Darbus, she\\'s out to get me.\" Gabriella feels her eyes grow wide, and a feeling of anger flicker inside of her as well. She figured that Sharpay would lash out at her over what happened in the cafeteria at some point, but Gabriella feels offended at the notion that she has malign intent. She\\'s only done all of this for the means of self-exploration, and to help Kelsi, not out of personal spite against Sharpay. Before she can speak up for herself, Ms. Darbus puts up a hand to stop Sharpay. \"And as I told you, I see no evidence to suggest that.\" Then, Ms. Darbus turns to Gabriella, a harsh glare on her face. \"Speaking of what happened on Friday, though, I\\'d like to see you in detention tomorrow, Ms. Montez.\" As Gabriella bites her lip and nods embarrassedly in response, Sharpay just smirks with satisfaction. \"But we\\'re still using Kelsi\\'s arrangement,\" Ms. Darbus continues, and Sharpay\\'s smirk is immediately wiped from her face. \"But, Ms. Darbus, the sped-up arrangement is so much better. Don\\'t we want to keep people awake?\" Gabriella\\'s eyes grow wide and Kelsi frowns dejectedly, but Ms. Darbus seems unfazed by Sharpay\\'s insult, just shaking her head. \"It\\'s a good song, Ms. Evans, and it fixes the problem you so kindly raised. And if I hear you complain one more time, you\\'ll be joining Ms. Montez in detention.\" \"Fine!\" Sharpay exclaims angrily, before stomping back to her seat. As she sits down, she crosses her arms, sulking, and swats Ryan\\'s hand away as he tries to squeeze her shoulder. The remainder of the rehearsal, neither Gabriella nor Sharpay speak up again, and Gabriella can feel Sharpay\\'s glaring eyes never leave her. Gabriella doesn\\'t regret speaking up, though. It was the right thing to do. And if that is what caused Sharpay to lash out at her, then so be it. And, if she were honest, a small part of her even enjoys riling up Sharpay. A part of her enjoys the challenge. A part of her is more intrigued by Sharpay than she should be. She doesn\\'t know why, but a part of her enjoys seeing the fury light up in Sharpay\\'s eyes. A part of her can\\'t stay away. Sharpay is angry. No, angry is too mild a word. She is furious, outraged . How dare Gabriella Montez come into the drama club, which practically only stays afloat due to her and her brother\\'s contributions, and think she can offer suggestions and commentary that go directly against her ideas? Furthermore, how dare Gabriella offer suggestions that are better than hers? Of course, she has already thought of Gabriella\\'s suggestion before, but she has decided that it would be better for her personally to suggest something different. However, Ms. Darbus and Gabriella are right. Her own suggestion was made out of selfish reasons, one being that she genuinely thinks Kelsi\\'s ballads are boring, and the other one being something too embarrassing to even say aloud. Gabriella\\'s suggestion, on the other hand, definitely improves the musical and the story they\\'re trying to tell, and that infuriates Sharpay. How dare Gabriella Montez do anything that is better than what Sharpay does? \"What was that all about?\" It doesn\\'t help that even Ryan seems to agree with Gabriella, judging by the way he\\'s pursing his lip in annoyance, standing still against the doorframe to her room as he waits for an answer. It could also be that he\\'s just annoyed at her for losing her temper in the middle of rehearsal, but she\\'s not going to apologize for not going down without a fight. Sharpay shrugs casually. \"It was just a disagreement.\" Ryan lets out a disbelieving laugh as he walks into the room and sits down on the chair standing by her vanity mirror. \"Shar, that was more than a disagreement,\" he says pointedly, and Sharpay shrugs again as she quirks an eyebrow. \"I told you, I don\\'t trust that girl. She\\'s trouble. You can\\'t tell me you still can\\'t see it? She dumped her lunch on me! She got our arrangement of What I\\'ve Been Looking For , which our rehearsal pianist worked very hard and tirelessly on, removed from the show, just like that!\" \"I still think the lunch thing was probably an accident,\" Ryan says, ignoring Sharpay\\'s responding scowl. \"And you were trying to get the entire song shafted from the show. Which I don\\'t really get, because I thought you liked that song.\" She did. She does. Musically, there\\'s nothing wrong with the song – well, the up-tempo arrangement, at least; the original one remains dreadful. It\\'s just that every time she hears this song now, she thinks of Gabriella. She thinks of that dreadful audition, and the sparkle in her pretty brown eyes as they held eye contact steadfastly throughout a large portion of the song, and it makes her feel uneasy. She doesn\\'t want to be reminded of that memory constantly. She wants to forget it, and erase those damn eyes from her mind. She\\'s not going to admit that out loud, though. \"I just didn\\'t think it fit,\" she says instead, and Ryan sighs and rolls his eyes. \"I hope you know you\\'re being difficult.\" \"And I hope you know you\\'re being a bad brother,\" she retorts without second thought, immediately feeling guilty as Ryan\\'s face falls into a deep frown. Sighing as she leaps from her bed, she approaches him and pouts in what she hopes is an adorable fashion. \"I\\'m sorry, I shouldn\\'t have said that. I just feel like you\\'re taking her side over mine.\" Ryan sighs, too, as he shakes his head and his lips form a thin grimace. \"I\\'ve told you, I am always on your side. I just don\\'t think she\\'s worth getting riled up over constantly, especially when you and I know both know that you\\'re more talented than she could ever dream of being.\" Sharpay scoffs. \"Well, at least she\\'s proven my point today. Maybe this suggestion wasn\\'t that bad, but it was probably just a fluke. Her next suggestion is probably going to make the musical worse. Hell, she\\'ll probably end up ruining the entire production.\" \"If it\\'s a bad suggestion, Ms. Darbus won\\'t allow it,\" Ryan answers with a shrug. \"Come on, you\\'ve got to give her more credit than that.\" Sharpay rolls her eyes. \"No, Ms. Darbus loves her and would do anything she says, I can tell. She\\'s like that with anyone who has at least the tiniest bit of talent.\" Ryan\\'s eyebrows furrow. \"Don\\'t we have talent?\" \"Exactly.\" Ryan rolls his eyes again, before sighing. \"Sis, I don\\'t understand why you\\'re so adamant about this girl being evil or the song not fitting, but you need to let it go. You know what mom always says – worrying will just give you frown lines.\" At that, Sharpay blinks and touches her forehead as she relaxes her face, but the worries don\\'t dissipate. She wishes she could get let it go like Ryan says, but she can\\'t. She can\\'t shake those doe-eyes, she can\\'t shake that squeaky, sweet voice, she can\\'t shake anything about this girl. With a huff, she shakes her head. \"No. She has to be destroyed. At the very least, we have to get her out of the musical and the drama club. We have to do something to save what is sacred to us.\" \"Sharpay…\" Ryan sighs, warningly, as he rubs his temple with exasperation, but Sharpay just waves his annoyance off. \"Come on, Ryan, it\\'s our duty!\" Although she shows him her cutest pout again, he doesn\\'t seem to fall for it, throwing his hands up in the air in defeat. \"Whatever. I tried. Just don\\'t let her consume you. She\\'s not worth it.\" And then he stands up and leaves her room. And she\\'s alone with her thoughts again. Consumed by that infuriating girl and her sparkly eyes. The next day, Sharpay starts to understand where Ryan is coming from, when she\\'s walking down the hallways and suddenly swears she can hear Gabriella\\'s voice, sweet yet slightly squeaky, sing. Cocking her head in confusion and alarm, she quickly looks around to see if she can spot Gabriella everywhere. Nothing. Is she hallucinating Gabriella\\'s voice now? God, Ryan was right. She\\'s in way too deep. She needs to take a step back and breathe, to refocus. Walking towards the bathroom to splash some water on her face to get rid of Gabriella\\'s voice inside her head, she feels her face turn down into a grimace when she finds out she wasn\\'t imagining anything at all. Gabriella Montez is there, with the sheet music to one of the songs, Breaking Free . Her eyes widen considerably as she stares at Sharpay in the entrance, and Sharpay rolls her eyes as she steps forward and walks towards the sinks, checking out her own reflection in the mirror. From the corner of her eye, she can see that Gabriella is still staring at her, wide-eyed, and she quirks an eyebrow in response. \"What?\" Blinking in astonishment at Sharpay\\'s loud voice, Gabriella averts her gaze and stares at the floor nervously for a few seconds, before squeaking, \"Hi.\" Sharpay sends her a sarcastic smile, before rummaging in her purse to find her lipstick. Might as well take this moment to do some touching up on her make-up, she supposes. Gabriella just watches as Sharpay applies her lipstick, opening her mouth several times, but closing it before saying anything. \"You know, I heard you singing before I came in,\" Sharpay finally breaks the silence after smacking her lips, and she briefly wonders why the hell she\\'s engaging in conversation with Gabriella Montez. Gabriella just blushes in response, looking down at the paper still in her hands, before shrugging. \"Yeah, Kelsi gave me the song, and I figured it wouldn\\'t hurt to practice a little bit.\" Sharpay lets out a short laugh as she puts the lipstick back in her purse and turns around, leaning against the sink. \"Yeah, you\\'re gonna need all the practice you can get,\" she retorts, watching with a sarcastic smirk as Gabriella frowns dejectedly in response. However, she recovers quickly, looking down at the paper again and smiling half-heartedly. \"Yeah, I know, I\\'m inexperienced. You\\'ve told me.\" Sharpay scowls for a second at Gabriella\\'s playful exasperation and the fact that she doesn\\'t seem affected by her insult, but then Gabriella looks up and Sharpay sees a spark in her eyes. She\\'s become used to the sparks in Gabriella\\'s eyes by now – thanks to the dreadful memories from the auditions that won\\'t stop haunting her –, but this is different. It\\'s not fear or determination or curiosity in her eyes right now, but rather something else. It\\'s almost like she wants to ask Sharpay something, but doesn\\'t know how to. And, as Gabriella\\'s gaze keeps flickering back and forth between the sheet music and her, Sharpay realizes what is going on. Of course Gabriella is inexperienced. Sharpay has reminded her of that to taunt her and to legitimize her own hatred for this girl she\\'s only known for a little over a week, but it\\'s also a harsh truth. And it seems that Gabriella needs help. As naturally talented as she is, she\\'s quite obviously not an experienced singer and she\\'s still learning to control her voice and to use the proper techniques. And that so happens to be something that Sharpay is good at. Sharpay smirks. Gabriella needs her help. Finally, she has the upper hand. And there\\'s certainly no harm in making sure that Gabriella knows what her shortcomings are. \"You know, your voice is a little nasal,\" she tells Gabriella, using her fakest sweet voice. \"You need to breathe less through your nose and more through your stomach when you\\'re singing. That would make that squeaky voice of yours slightly more bearable to listen to.\" Sharpay expects Gabriella\\'s face to fall, but instead, she narrows her eyes on Sharpay thoughtfully for a split second, before her face splits into a genuine grin. \"Ah, yes, that makes sense!\" she exclaims, immediately grabbing a pen from her bag, ignoring a confused and irritated Sharpay as she scribbled something down on the sheet music, before looking up again. \"Any other suggestions?\" Sharpay purses her lips. This is not going according to plan. Gabriella is supposed to feel insecure. She\\'s not actually supposed to be taking this as genuinely well-intentioned feedback. Okay, enough of the actual feedback on her vocals. Maybe Sharpay needs to try something else to intimidate her. \"You know, you shouldn\\'t be singing in the bathroom, actually,\" she says, as she waves her hand around. \"The acoustics are very different than in the auditorium and literally anyone could walk in on you. You wouldn\\'t want to embarrass yourself in front of the cheerleaders, don\\'t you?\" Moreover, it wouldn\\'t make Sharpay think she\\'s losing her mind, but Gabriella doesn\\'t need to know just how bothered she is by her. Gabriella blushes with embarrassment, fiddling with her pen as she mumbles, \"Well, I\\'ve already humiliated myself in front of the entire cafeteria, so I don\\'t have much of my dignity to lose.\" Sharpay scoffs at the memory. \"You humiliated me too, and you ruined one of my favourite blazers, so excuse me if I don\\'t feel sorry for you.\" Gabriella musters a meek smile in response and nods, before opening her mouth, probably to grovel for an apology, and Sharpay feels her smirk return as she realizes things are finally about to get good. However, just then, the bell rings, startling both of them. They stare at each other for a moment afterwards, unsure of how to end this conversation, before Gabriella suddenly rushes to stuff her pen and her sheet music in her bag, before running to the exit of the bathroom. Before she leaves, she turns around to send Sharpay another genuine smile, and Sharpay feels an urge to strangle her just for that curl of lips. \"Thanks for the tip,\" Gabriella says, and Sharpay shoots her a fake smile in advance as she waves sarcastically. \"Remember to breathe through your nose!\" As Gabriella disappears from view, Sharpay\\'s smile turns into a scowl as she turns back to the mirror, inspecting her own face thoroughly as she wonders if she has lost her intimidating touch. Why won\\'t Gabriella be intimidated by her? And why does she always keep losing the upper hand? Gabriella enjoys being in the musical. Despite the many stares she has received since last Friday and the wrath of Sharpay she has brought upon herself, she\\'s really enjoying herself, meeting new people and learning new things. One of those great things about the musical is Kelsi. She and Kelsi have a lot in common, she\\'s starting to realize. Both of them are shy – although Gabriella is starting to get over that more and more –, both of them have been taunted by the likes of Sharpay Evans, both of them are passionate and determined, and, as it turns out, both of them care a lot about helping others. It was kind of Kelsi to give her extra songs to practice, so she can improve her vocals for the musical. At the time, Kelsi had told her it was a gift in return for Gabriella standing up for her, but Gabriella can sense that Kelsi isn\\'t only interested in returning favours, but she\\'s also interested in genuinely helping her further. And she really needs the help, she\\'s found out. Not only with the actual singing, but also with handling Sharpay Evans. Now, she knows that Kelsi isn\\'t going to explicitly stand up to Sharpay, but she\\'s just glad to have at least one person in her corner in the drama club, who will give her words of encouragement when she needs them. The thing is, though, that she feels like Sharpay, of all people, could be that kind of person, too. Gabriella is no fool. The other day, when they ran into each other in the bathroom, Sharpay wasn\\'t giving her advice out of the goodness of her heart. She was trying to tear her down, bring out her insecurities. But Sharpay\\'s advice was good . Gabriella has been trying very hard to breathe through her stomach more than her nose lately, and she feels like it has genuinely helped. And apparently, she\\'s not the only one that notices. \"Your vocals have improved,\" Kelsi says as they sit down in the rehearsal room for the one-on-one rehearsal they\\'ve scheduled – they\\'re really just hanging out, though, even though neither of them has admitted that out loud. Gabriella smiles. \"Thanks. I ran into Sharpay the other day and she advised me to breathe through my stomach more and it has really helped!\" Kelsi closes her eyes for a second, before shaking her head with exasperation. \"Sharpay is giving you advice? Please don\\'t take anything she says to heart.\" Gabriella laughs as she reaches up for her cup of tea on top of the piano and takes a sip. \"Yeah, I know she\\'s only doing it to intimidate me. But it did actually help.\" \"That\\'s Sharpay for you,\" Kelsi says, suddenly staring ahead forlornly. \"She knows exactly how to play on your insecurities and beat you down.\" Gabriella bites her lip as she puts her cup down again. \"Does she do it to everyone?\" Kelsi shrugs. \"Yeah, to anyone who\\'s in her way. And also sometimes just because she thinks it\\'s fun.\" \"So, that\\'s why she has so much power in the drama club? Because everyone fears her?\" As Kelsi shrugs and nods, Gabriella sighs. \"Even Ms. Darbus?\" \"Oh, no, Ms. Darbus just loves her because she and Ryan are the most talented performers,\" Kelsi answers, before nudging Gabriella. \"Well, they were , at least.\" They still are, Gabriella thinks. As much as she tries, she is nowhere near Sharpay\\'s level of experience and talent. And she doesn\\'t feel like she needs to be – she doesn\\'t feel inadequate with what she has –, but it doesn\\'t sit well with her that this gives Sharpay power over her. As Gabriella stares ahead thoughtfully, memories of Sharpay\\'s attempts at intimidation whirling through her mind, Kelsi suddenly stands up from the piano. \"Maybe we should take a break. More tea?\" Gabriella smiles and nods, standing up as well before they walk to a table that is sat in the middle of the room. \"I\\'m really glad that you\\'re here, you know,\" Kelsi says as they sit down, her thumb circling over the rim of her mug. \"It\\'s refreshing to see someone who\\'s not intimidated by Sharpay.\" Gabriella lets out a disbelieving laugh. \"Are you kidding me? I\\'m terrified of when her next outburst will be. But I just can\\'t stand it when people treat others unfairly like she does. Someone has to do something. That\\'s why I went through with joining the drama club in the first place.\" As Kelsi looks at her questioningly, she explains, \"I auditioned on a whim. I didn\\'t decide to actually go through with it if I got a role until I spoke with you afterwards.\" Kelsi grins shyly and looks down at her cup. \"Well, I\\'m glad you did. And I\\'m really glad you helped me, because my arrangements have never been selected for the musical before.\" As Kelsi looks up again, there\\'s a brightness in her eyes that makes Gabriella smile. She\\'s so happy, so proud, and it kills Gabriella that this brightness has been put to slumber for way too long. Kelsi deserves to be appreciated and feel like she\\'s good enough. So, she reaches out and squeezes her hand. \"Your song deserves to be in the show. It\\'s amazing.\" Kelsi blushes and giggles. \"Thanks. I really appreciate your help, especially since Sharpay probably hates you more than she hates anyone else right now. No one has defied her like that, ever.\" \"Well, it\\'s high time someone did.\" Kelsi nods. \"Maybe she\\'s finally met her match.\" Gabriella blinks and look down at her teacup as she contemplates that. She\\'s not entirely sure if she fully believes what Kelsi is saying – Sharpay is still much more powerful than she is –, but there is some truth to it. The entire reason that Sharpay is so angry at her is that she feels as if Gabriella is a threat to her, as if they\\'re on a similar level. It\\'s too bad that this apparently upsets Sharpay, because strangely enough, Gabriella seems to have changed her mind about Sharpay since their impromptu meeting in the bathroom. She has begun to realize that they might actually be good for each other if there wasn\\'t so much animosity between them. Sharpay could show Gabriella the world of theatre, and Gabriella could probably teach Sharpay a little something about treating your peers with respect. They really could encourage each other to become better. As that thought enters her mind, Gabriella suddenly feels a feeling of melancholy settle in her stomach. Despite her initial wariness of the girl and the confirmation of her suspicions by means of everything that\\'s happened between them so far, Gabriella feels a longing for a truce with Sharpay. As opposite as their personalities and goals are, they could really learn from each other, and it\\'s a really shame that Sharpay feels so threatened by Gabriella that she can\\'t see past her own misguided hatred. She wishes Sharpay would just give her a chance. She knows they won\\'t be best friends, but she really hates the hostility between them. She really hates the way that Sharpay treats the drama club unfairly, but she also hates the way that Sharpay treats her unfairly. She wishes there was a way to stop it, or to stop being so bothered by it. She knows not everyone is always going to like her, but she still feels a pang of hurt at the thought that someone she barely knows, someone she could learn a lot from, loathes her with such unbridled passion. She wishes she could fix it, convince Sharpay that she\\'s not as bad as she seems, start over after they got off on completely the wrong foot. She has a feeling that they could be great for each other if they did that. Realizing she\\'s been quiet for a while, Gabriella looks up at Kelsi again and smiles. \"Maybe we are a match.\" She really wishes they were. A/N: I hope it doesn\\'t feel weird and unnatural for Gabriella to have this change of heart. I think it is in character for her, as I always imagine that Gabriella, in any scenario, would have preferred to be friends with Sharpay over their rivalry, and would have been the first to open up to the possibility that they could challenge each other in good ways if they just got over themselves. I hope this comes across well, because to be honest, I\\'ve found it very difficult to write the enemies to lovers aspect of this story, lol. Anyway, please leave a review if you can, I would really appreciate that!'][Chapter 5] ['\"How about we go through the scene where Minnie tells Mary about Arnold?\" There\\'s only two possible reasons as to why the first scene they\\'re practicing today is one between Sharpay and Gabriella. Ms. Darbus is out for them, or she\\'s forcing them to get along. And Gabriella can\\'t even blame Ms. Darbus if it\\'s the second option, really, since Minnie and Mary\\'s friendship is an essential part of the plot and if the actresses don\\'t get along, that\\'s no good. However, that doesn\\'t mean she\\'s looking forward to spending one-on-one time with Sharpay. Well, at least, that\\'s what she tells herself. She\\'s still wary of the diva\\'s behaviour directed towards her, but after her revelation that she and Sharpay would be good to each other as friends, she\\'s become… curious about her. All that Gabriella really knows about Sharpay is that she\\'s an ambitious actress who enjoys power, and there must be more to her than that. She doesn\\'t think Sharpay will reveal anything more about herself to her, though. Much like Gabriella herself before she came to East High, Sharpay seems emotionally closed off, afraid and unwilling to show her true self to others, or at least to Gabriella. The only thing she will show Gabriella is hostility and her ability to intimidate, and today will be no exception, as she glares daggers at Gabriella upon hearing Ms. Darbus\\'s directions, before turning to their teacher. \"But Ms. Darbus! Wouldn\\'t it be wise to start off with a scene of Arnold and Minnie? After all, they are the main characters, and my brother and I are the most experienced performers,\" Sharpay states, before turning back to Gabriella and smiling phonily. \"Ryan and I could teach our less experienced peers how it\\'s done.\" From the corner of her eye, Gabriella sees Ryan roll his eyes and Kelsi shoot Gabriella an annoyed look, but she keeps a straight face as she stares right into Sharpay\\'s eyes. Sharpay won\\'t get her down. Ms. Darbus shakes her head. \"No, I want you to perform this scene.\" Sharpay pouts for a second, before a realization seems to dawn on her and her face morphs into a smirk. \"Actually, never mind. I think it\\'s a great idea, Ms. Darbus.\" \"It is?\" Ryan perks up, confused, while Gabriella blinks in astonishment, before bracing herself for the explanation. Surely, Sharpay is aiming to hurl another insult her way. \"Well, yes, Gabriella is new and we haven\\'t seen her acting yet. I\\'m sure she\\'ll need a lot of notes, and by letting her practice early, we could get ahead of it.\" There it is. Gabriella grimaces in response, while Ms. Darbus purses her lips in annoyance, before admitting, \"That was one of my reasons, actually, although I wouldn\\'t put it that way.\" Sharpay has the decency to slump down a little when Ms. Darbus sends her a fierce warning glare, but Gabriella\\'s face sours even more as she realizes what kind of pressure she\\'s under right now. She knows Ms. Darbus means well, though, but she knows that Sharpay is going to do everything in her power to make Gabriella feel like she\\'s a bad actress and that she doesn\\'t belong here. God, it\\'s been a little over a week since that audition, and Gabriella is already so tired. As Ms. Darbus motions for them to come up, she sighs as she trudges up there, exchanging a brief smile and knowing look with Kelsi. At least she\\'s not facing the audience, so she won\\'t get too much stage fright, she thinks as she turns to face Sharpay, who\\'s still smirking. \"I hope you know what you\\'re getting yourself into,\" she whispers tauntingly, and Gabriella just smiles in return, before turning to her script, letting her eyes scan her lines one more time before they start the scene. \"And, action!\" And, then, Sharpay transforms. Gone is the smug smirk, and the harsh coldness in her eyes, replaced by a dreamy, soft glow and the first genuine smile Gabriella has ever seen on her face. In the back of mind, she registers that Sharpay\\'s smile is very pretty. \"Oh, Mary, I\\'ve met someone,\" Sharpay says with a wistful sigh and for a second, Gabriella is startled by her change in demeanour. She really is a good actress. There\\'s no way around it – Gabriella is impressed. Scrambling to regain her composure after a split second of being amazed, Gabriella quickly lets an excited smile blossom on her face as well. \"Tell me more!\" A quick flash of the harshness returns to Sharpay\\'s eyes for a split second, before she hides it with another happy sigh. \"I just met him at the market and Mary, he\\'s wonderful!\" \"What is his name?\" Gabriella asks, and Sharpay sits down next to her, not too close as she starts rambling about Arnold as if he\\'s a real person and she\\'s really in love with him, and as if she and Gabriella are real friends, sharing laughter and deep secrets and smiles. How Gabriella wishes this were real. How she wishes her stomach didn\\'t flutter in pleasure at pretending to be so close to Sharpay. How she wishes Sharpay would smile at her for real. However, this is not the time to long for Sharpay, so she pushes those thoughts to the back of her mind and continues playing along, revelling in this fantasy as long as she possibly can. And so the scene continues, until Ms. Darbus yells, \"And scene!\" Immediately, the coldness returns to Sharpay\\'s demeanour as she stands up a little straighter and her eyes narrow at Gabriella. \"Brava!\" Ms. Darbus exclaims. \"Ms. Montez, you were a little nervous and wooden in the beginning, but all in all, that was very good for the first time. For both of you. You have chemistry.\" Both pairs of eyes widen in response. They have chemistry? While they have such a hostile relationship? That makes no sense. Gabriella bites her lip as she locks eyes with Sharpay, who looks furious as always, before the blonde smiles at Ms. Darbus and storms off the stage without saying anything else. With a sigh, Gabriella follows and takes a seat next to Kelsi, who sends her an encouraging smile. \"You were great,\" Kelsi whispers in her ear, and Gabriella moves her head down and blushes in response. Apparently, she was good because she has chemistry with Sharpay. Maybe she wasn\\'t so far off to think that there\\'s some potential there. She just wishes Sharpay could see that, too. So, after rehearsal, she decides to put herself out there, to try to be the better person and to approach Sharpay. \"Hey,\" she says as she walks up to Sharpay, who looks around in confusion, before sending her a glare. \"What do you want?\" \"I just wanted to let you know that I enjoyed acting with you. You\\'re very talented.\" Sharpay rolls her eyes. \"Of course I am. Do you think I don\\'t know that?\" Gabriella shakes her head and laughs. \"I could learn a lot from you.\" Sharpay quirks an eyebrow, before smirking. \"Well, yeah, Ms. Darbus was just trying to be nice, your inexperience really showed.\" Gabriella sighs. \"Sharpay, please stop.\" As Sharpay\\'s smirk grows increasingly smug, Gabriella shakes her head, before continuing, \"Look, I know you\\'re only pointing out my inexperience and my flaws to tear me down. It\\'s not working, but your advice actually did help. You and I both know you just want this musical to be a success, and wouldn\\'t it be best for the musical if we got along?\" Sharpay\\'s eyes widen and her voice rises an octave with rage and panic as she asks, \"Are you asking me to be your friend?!\" \"I\\'m just asking you to open yourself up a little,\" Gabriella responds with a shrug, before motioning around. \"I mean, look what happened to me when I opened up myself.\" \"You ruined my life, that\\'s what happened!\" Sharpay snaps with a furious scowl and Gabriella purses her lips in response, unsure of what to say about that. Gabriella shrugs again. \"Just thought I\\'d give you some food for thought, I guess.\" And then she walks off, leaving behind a perplexed and enraged Sharpay, and lets out a heavy breath she doesn\\'t know she was holding. At least she tried. Somehow, Gabriella\\'s conversation with Sharpay after rehearsal has made Sharpay\\'s behaviour even worse. Gabriella can see it in the way she storms through the hallways the next day, and it scares her a little. All this time, she thought Sharpay was the one with the power, but it seems that she holds power over Sharpay as well. It\\'s terrifying to hold such power over someone, to make them so angry. As Sharpay approaches Gabriella\\'s locker, where she\\'s standing with Taylor, she sends Gabriella one of her most terrifying death glares yet and Gabriella is already mentally bracing herself, before Sharpay gets distracted by bumping into what seems to be an innocent freshman. \"I\\'m so sorry!\" the boy exclaims, and Sharpay puts her hand on her hip as she glares at him furiously. \"Watch where you\\'re going, you freak!\" she shouts, and Gabriella almost wants to step in to defend the poor boy, who is cowering under Sharpay\\'s gaze. This is not this poor boy\\'s fault in any way. Sharpay wasn\\'t watching where she was going, and furthermore, her beef isn\\'t with this random freshman she bumped into, it\\'s with Gabriella. It\\'s unfair to take it out on this kid. Yet she doesn\\'t step in, just exchanging a wary glance with Taylor as they watch the scene unfold. \"I… I know. It\\'s my fault. I said I\\'m sorry,\" the boy stammers, and Sharpay just keeps her angry eyes trained on him for a second. \"Then why are you still standing here? Move!\" Sharpay roars, but the boy stays frozen with fear as Sharpay only waits a split second to step closer to him threateningly. \"I told you to move,\" she hisses menacingly. \"If you don\\'t move right this second, I will murder you.\" That seems to do the trick, as the boy blinks, before quickly scurrying off, Sharpay\\'s angry eyes following him until he\\'s out of sight. Then, she seems to realize she\\'s caught a lot of looks from bypassing students and musters a fake smile. \"Nothing to see here!\" And with a dissatisfied grunt, she walks off with large, angry strides. \"She seems to be in a mood,\" Taylor comments half-heartedly as Gabriella turns back to her locker to grab a book from it with a sigh. \"Yeah, I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s because of me.\" Taylor raises her eyebrows. \"I knew Sharpay could hold grudges, but it\\'s been two weeks since what happened in the cafeteria. Why would she only be in this sour mood now?\" \"I don\\'t think it is because of the cafeteria,\" Gabriella admits as she closes her locker and leans her back against it. \"There\\'s been more disagreements between us since then.\" Taylor lets out a thoughtful sound. \"I would ask how the musical is going, but I guess that\\'s my answer right there.\" Gabriella shakes her head vigorously. \"No, I actually really love doing the musical. It\\'s been a lot of fun. Sharpay just can\\'t warm up to me, that\\'s all.\" Taylor laughs and crosses her arms, shooting Gabriella a knowing look. \"Can\\'t or won\\'t?\" Gabriella rolls her eyes playfully. \"Won\\'t.\" Suddenly, the bell rings and Taylor\\'s eyes widen. \"Let\\'s go.\" As they walk towards homeroom together silently, Gabriella can\\'t shake the incident that they just witnessed. Of course she knows she plays a large part in Sharpay\\'s foul mood, but Sharpay\\'s anger was so… strong. Is Sharpay really that upset just because Gabriella tried to call for a truce? Why would a request to bury the hatchet makes things that much worse? Does Sharpay really hate her that much? And why does that notion break Gabriella\\'s heart a little? \"Do you want to talk about it?\" Taylor snaps her out of her thoughts, and Gabriella blinks as she looks up, realizing she has been frowning deeply while in thought. \"Not really,\" Gabriella says, shaking her head before biting her lip. \"I guess I\\'m just a little bothered that Sharpay is this angry because I tried to make peace with her.\" Taylor merely shrugs in response. \"I told you, that girl holds grudges.\" She knows that, and she knows that Sharpay shouldn\\'t bother her that much, but she does. Ever since she realized how much Sharpay could help her, she\\'s been so bothered by this rivalry between them. She wishes they could be more than vengeful enemies. \"I\\'m sure she\\'ll get used to you eventually,\" Taylor continues, her voice and her face softening a little. \"It will just take a long time.\" Gabriella sighs. \"I guess so.\" As they arrive in the classroom, Gabriella shoots a smile at Troy, before walking to her seat in the back of the room. Taylor follows her, suddenly smiling excitedly. \"We\\'re still on for this afternoon, right?\" she asks, and Gabriella can\\'t help but smile at Taylor\\'s excitement as she nods. \"Yes, I will attend your scholastic decathlon meeting,\" she assures her, and Taylor throws a fist in the air in excitement, sending Gabriella into a fit of giggles. \"I can\\'t wait!\" As Taylor settles in her own seat, shooting Gabriella one last excited smile, Gabriella\\'s eyes wander to Sharpay and she sighs. She really is excited for the scholastic decathlon meeting, if not just to be somewhere where she feels welcomed. She hates how much Sharpay\\'s attitude towards her bothers her so much. She loves the musical, but there will always be that pink cloud of dread hanging over it, and it will only get worse the more time she and Sharpay spend together. She hates that she has the power to anger Sharpay. She hates that they won\\'t just get along. She hates that she wants them to get along. Gabriella finds that it\\'s nice to have people who are on her side, who are truly her friends. It\\'s nice to have someone like Taylor, who watches out for her, and someone like Kelsi, who helps her. It\\'s nice to have someone like Troy, who understands her. Their little meetings on the rooftop during free period have become a nearly daily habit, and it\\'s nice to be able to talk to him and really feel like he\\'s listening. \"You looked a little upset this morning,\" is the first thing that comes out his mouth as she climbs the stairs today, and Gabriella smiles meekly in response. \"I just have a lot on my mind,\" she admits, as she walks up to the railing to stand beside him, looking out at the comforting view. With a sigh, she feels all the worries fall off her for a moment in an instant. Troy\\'s eyes, however, are not on the mountaintops. Instead, she can feel his concerned gaze drill into the side of her face. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" he asks, and Gabriella bites her lip in response. She really does want to talk about it. When Taylor asked her about it this morning, she felt a little hesitant to discuss what is bothering her. As well-intentioned as Taylor is, she doesn\\'t really understand the impasse Gabriella is in with Sharpay. For some reason, Gabriella thinks that Troy might be able to understand her, though. \"Sharpay has been wearing me down a lot,\" she admits as she turns to meet Troy\\'s gaze, which darkens a little as he winces in understanding. \"She\\'s… a lot to handle sometimes,\" Troy agrees, his hand flying up to his neck. \"She used to have a crush on me. I think she still does actually. She\\'s very… intense about it.\" Gabriella can\\'t help but grin, somehow not surprised that Sharpay would be one of Troy\\'s many admirers, but she\\'s also a little amused by his obvious discomfort. Taylor\\'s words that wrongfully implied that he was a ladies\\' man swirl through her head, and somehow, she starts to wonder if this is what is wrong with Sharpay, too. For all their differences, Troy and Gabriella have one thing in common – they feel misunderstood. Maybe Sharpay does, too. Maybe that\\'s why she\\'s so angry all the time. \"Intense is definitely the word I\\'d use,\" Gabriella sighs, looking down at her hands and fiddling with them. \"She\\'s the opposite with me, though. She doesn\\'t like me, she hates me.\" Troy frowns in response and he opens his mouth to reply, but Gabriella smiles and shakes her head. \"Yeah, I know it\\'s because she feels threatened by me.\" Then, she sighs again and refocuses her gaze on the view. \"I kind of wish we could be friends, though. I know it sounds silly, but I feel like there\\'s more to her than meets the eye.\" There\\'s a silence for a moment, before Troy softly tells her, \"I don\\'t think it\\'s silly. I think it\\'s kind of amazing.\" As Gabriella\\'s gaze snaps back to Troy, she drowns a little in the warm blue of his eyes. \"Sharpay can be ruthless when someone is in her way, and she\\'s probably been awful to you, yet you still want to give her a chance,\" he explains, smiling. \"That just shows how kind a person you are.\" Gabriella feels her cheeks heat up as they stare at each other, before ducking her head. \"Thanks. I don\\'t think she sees it that way, though. I tried to make peace with her and she only got worse.\" \"Well, that\\'s her loss if she doesn\\'t want to get to know someone as amazing as you,\" Troy says firmly, and Gabriella giggles nervously and tucks a hair behind her ear as her cheeks heat up even more. She stays quiet for a moment, before mumbling, \"I think it\\'s also that I want people to like me and I can\\'t stand that she refuses to give me a chance.\" Troy chuckles. \"And the only way to get her to like you is for you to make a compromise and let her walk all over you.\" Gabriella\\'s head snaps up. \"Yes! Exactly!\" Troy sighs as he runs a hand through his hair, before refocusing his gaze on the view. \"I know the feeling exactly. I know I said that I wanted to be more than the basketball guy, but I think I also let them think of me like that because I\\'m afraid they won\\'t like me otherwise.\" He lets out a short laugh as he shakes her head, before shooting her a smile. \"You\\'re not like that. You could have just let them push you into the box of freaky math girl to please them, but you didn\\'t. You showed them your true self, no matter what others think of it.\" Gabriella blinks a couple of times, before mumbling, \"Well...\" \"You\\'ve come so far, Gabriella,\" Troy says, suddenly sounding desperate. \"Don\\'t give up on yourself now. I know it sounds hypocrite coming from me, but not everyone is going to like you. And if they don\\'t appreciate you for how amazing and brave you are, then they\\'re not worth it.\" His eyes are boring into hers and she can sense his underlying meaning, and the flame inside her flickers. Don\\'t give up for me , is what he\\'s saying. \"I won\\'t give up,\" she assures him. \"I\\'m just... a little sad, because Sharpay and I really could have been great friends.\" Troy smiles as he softly lays a hand on her shoulder and squeezes comfortingly. \"Maybe she\\'ll come to her senses one day… Wait, who am I kidding? This is Sharpay Evans.\" Gabriella bursts into giggles as she nods, before turning serious again and smiling at him gratefully. \"Thanks for listening,\" she says earnestly, hoping that he knows she truly appreciates him as much as he seems to appreciate her. \"Thanks for being here,\" he murmurs in response, and Gabriella\\'s smile only grows. Sharpay is still at the back of her mind, but she finally feels at ease. She may never get the chance to explore a friendship with Sharpay, but at least there\\'s someone out there who understands her. At least there\\'s someone like Troy. Sharpay is baffled by Gabriella Montez. Utterly, completely baffled. Every time she thinks that this girl cannot get any worse, she gets worse. How dare she want to bury the hatchet, act like nothing ever happened, as if she hasn\\'t ruined Sharpay\\'s life? No. If she\\'s tired of Sharpay\\'s antics, then good. That\\'s the entire point of Sharpay\\'s cruelty – to get a reaction out of her, something, anything. Yet something nags at Sharpay. Something about the way Gabriella looked at her, a slight hopeful twinkle in her eye, makes her reconsider everything. She\\'s not interested in Gabriella psycho-analyzing her – how dare she imply that Sharpay is emotionally closed off?! – or being buddies with her, but that twinkle in her eyes has her intrigued instead of angry for some inexplicable reason. If she were a less rational person, she\\'d even say she wants to see more of it and that\\'s a thought she can\\'t quite handle. She doesn\\'t want to yearn for anything more when it comes to Gabriella Montez. Yet she realizes that this is the first time that those haunting eyes haven\\'t completely infuriated her. Gabriella\\'s words have been possibly the most infuriating thing she\\'s done so far, but those eyes... the intrigue is masking the anger, and as begrudging as Sharpay is to admit this, it\\'s a welcome change. And that makes it infuriating again. There\\'s no way not to be enraged by the girl. She needs to clear her mind. And there\\'s no better way to do that than to have some rehearsal time for herself when there\\'s no group rehearsal today. However, when she enters the auditorium, the source of all her anger and all her worries is in the room. Her first instinct is to snap and shout and storm off, but that twinkle keeps haunting her and Sharpay decides that it\\'s best to lay her worries to rest once and for all by doing something out of the ordinary, to perform a little experiment. So, she doesn\\'t yell, instead holding her head high as she walks up to the stage, feeling Gabriella\\'s wide eyes follow her every move. \"I\\'m sorry, I can leave if you want,\" Gabriella says as Sharpay climbs up on stage, but Sharpay just shakes her head. \"No, it\\'s fine, go ahead.\" Gabriella quirks an eyebrow suspiciously, before turning back to the script she\\'s holding, biting her lip as she studies it thoughtfully before shaking her head. \"Actually, why don\\'t we just practice together? Since we\\'re both here now?\" she asks, and Sharpay purses her lips in annoyance. She\\'s trying hard. So hard. But this girl really continues to get on her last nerve by being so persistent despite Sharpay\\'s obvious disdain. However, Sharpay\\'s experiment is to see what would happen if they were civil to each other just once. Sharpay is nothing if not determined to see her plans through, so despite grimacing, she shrugs in what she hopes in a casual fashion. \"Sure.\" Gabriella\\'s eyes light up in that way that unnerves and haunts Sharpay and Sharpay reminds herself to keep breathing evenly as a smile blossoms on the brunette\\'s face. What a stupidly pretty smile. Sharpay wishes that she could make it vanish from her face and that she could forget about its existence. It makes her feel an urge either to fall back into her cruel behaviour or to run away, and neither are an option, so she decides to do the one thing that she can do to get out of this suffocating situation, staring into Gabriella\\'s eyes and feeling a little overwhelmed by her smile. \"Actually, I have a better idea,\" she chokes out, watching with slight relief as Gabriella\\'s face falls. \"You said you wanted to learn from me, right? There\\'s no better way to learn than to watch. I was going to practice my solo anyway, so maybe you could just watch me.\" Gabriella\\'s eyes narrow thoughtfully, before that irritating smile returns, as does that hopeful spark that is the bane of Sharpay\\'s existence. \"Are you saying you\\'ll help me?\" Sharpay rolls her eyes. \"No, I needed to practice the song. That\\'s the only reason why I\\'m doing this. Because it benefits me .\" Gabriella\\'s grin reduces a little in size, but it doesn\\'t completely disappear. \"Alright.\" She nods and lets out a tinkling laugh as Sharpay rudely motions for her to take a seat, walking off to the side of the stage and grabbing a chair that\\'s sitting there, perching curiously as she waits for Sharpay to start. Sharpay thanks whatever deity may be out there for the fact that Gabriella is not directly in her line of sight. At least she doesn\\'t have to worry about her presence being too annoying or distracting. However, she can\\'t deny that Gabriella\\'s eyes on her and her general presence have an effect on her as she sings the song about fairytales and wishes upon stars, but it\\'s not a negative one. It makes her want to work a little harder, to prove herself a little harder, and it makes for her best performance of the song yet. Gabriella seems to be rightfully impressed as well, clapping loudly when Sharpay finishes the song. \"Beautiful!\" she exclaims, and Sharpay can\\'t help but smirk a little proudly as she turns to Gabriella, who has that irritating spark in her eyes again. Putting a hand on her hip, Sharpay says, \"Your turn.\" Gabriella bites her lip, before nodding and grabbing her script again. However, then her eyes widen. \"What time is it?\" Sharpay quirks an eyebrow, but before she can answer, Gabriella is already checking her own watch. \"Oh no. I was supposed to meet Taylor ten minutes ago. She\\'s going to kill me.\" Sharpay just watches as she hurries to stuff her script in her bag, and all but hurries out of the auditorium, much like that day in the bathroom. However, this time, she stops in her tracks and turns around, staring at Sharpay for a moment, appearing as if she wants to tell her something, but doesn\\'t know how to put it into words. Gabriella\\'s eyes are sparkling more than ever and Sharpay suddenly feels nervous as she stares back, feeling a little lost in the darkness of Gabriella\\'s wide orbs. Suddenly, one word comes to mind. One that was spoken with regard to them not too long ago, one that infuriated her to no end. Chemistry. Her breath hitching, Sharpay averts her gaze and grimaces as she turns away from Gabriella and tries to come to terms with what the hell just happened and why her heart is beating so fast. \"Thanks,\" she hears Gabriella mumble almost inaudibly, and then there\\'s footsteps until Gabriella has disappeared. Exhaling deeply, Sharpay puts a hand over her heart, feeling more irritated and confused than ever. Well, that\\'s the end of being civil to Gabriella. A/N: Man, I feel like I\\'m being very bad at showing vs. telling with the chemistry thing, lmao. I hope you enjoyed anyway, though. Also, I am quite obviously improvising with the actual script of the Twinkle Towne, because it is still a complete mystery to me to this very day what that damn musical was about. Please leave reviews, they make me very happy!'][Chapter 6] ['Gabriella can\\'t quite understand Sharpay. One moment, she\\'s hurling a stream of insults her way, and the next, she\\'s actually being civil to her and letting her watch as she rehearses. And then, she\\'s screaming murder, because the scene she\\'s rehearsing isn\\'t working for some reason. Gabriella frowns as Ms. Darbus sighs heavily, rubbing her temple, before waving around dramatically. \"Let\\'s just take five.\" Gabriella watches suspiciously as Sharpay marches straight over to Kelsi, who is on the other side of the stage, and she feels her body tense, ready to fight Sharpay and protect Kelsi if there is a need to. It\\'s a shame, really, that she and Sharpay are to be bound on opposite ends of arguments, because their impromptu one-on-one rehearsal was kind of nice. It was refreshing to be in a room with Sharpay and actually feel a little at ease. A little being keyword, as she is well aware that the other shoe could have dropped at any time. It didn\\'t in the end, but it was a realistic possibility. It makes her feel a little suspicious, though, as to why Sharpay was suddenly being civil towards her, even if it was quite obviously reluctantly. If Gabriella knows anything about this girl, it\\'s that she\\'s always cunning, and she is always ready to strike. So, why did she not try to intimidate her like last time? And why did they share that moment before Gabriella rushed out, their gazes locked as there flickered something like yearning in Sharpay\\'s hazelnut eyes? Maybe Gabriella is right about Sharpay. Maybe she yearns to break free, just like Gabriella and Troy do, and maybe she\\'s just trying to suppress her feelings. One thing is certain to Gabriella, though, after watching Sharpay rehearse – she is now sure than ever that she could benefit a lot from being on Sharpay\\'s good side. Which makes it a shame that Sharpay is glaring and hissing something, as Kelsi cowers under her gaze and Gabriella probably should step in. However, before she can do that, she\\'s snapped out of her thoughts by a male voice. \"Hi.\" Gabriella\\'s eyebrows furrow as she turns to her left and sees a smiling Ryan Evans at her side. She hasn\\'t actually spoken to Ryan at all since the auditions, since every time she\\'s seen him, he\\'s been following Sharpay around loyally. However, he still strikes her as someone nice, so she\\'s not all too suspicious that he\\'s approaching her. However, there\\'s still a little voice in the back of her mind saying that Sharpay is up to something. She suppresses that voice, though, and returns Ryan\\'s smile. \"Hey, Ryan.\" Ryan fiddles with his hands nervously for a second, before saying, \"Hey, we haven\\'t really had a chance to get to know each other, but I just wanted to let you know that I\\'m really happy you\\'re here.\" Gabriella quirks an eyebrow. \"You are? You don\\'t hate me like your sister does?\" Ryan sighs as both of them turn back to Sharpay and Kelsi, who are still talking. \"No, I\\'m not as ruthlessly ambitious as she is,\" he admits, before pausing. \"Although I am ambitious, too.\" Gabriella laughs and nods. \"Good to know.\" Silence befalls them for a moment, before Ryan says, \"Actually, I also wanted to apologize for Sharpay. I\\'m used to her antics, so I can handle them, but I\\'m sure they must be a little daunting for you.\" Daunting is certainly one way to put it. She\\'s been able to handle Sharpay\\'s insult just fine by just remembering that Sharpay is just as insecure as she is, but she can\\'t deny that Sharpay\\'s behaviour has bothered and exhausted her. She\\'s not sure she should tell that to Sharpay\\'s twin brother, though, so she just shrugs and says, \"It\\'s fine.\" Ryan laughs and shakes his head. \"You don\\'t have to lie. Don\\'t worry, I\\'m not going to turn around and tell her that you hate her or anything. Besides, I think she already knows that.\" Gabriella frowns. \"Well, I don\\'t hate her, though. I\\'m just sad, because I think we could be great friends if she just gave me a chance.\" Ryan raises his eyebrows. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever met anyone who wanted to be her friend after being yelled at by her. Except me, of course, but she\\'s my sister. She could try to murder me and I\\'d still love her.\" With a laugh, Gabriella shrugs. \"I don\\'t know, I just… have a feeling.\" Then, she turns to Ryan. \"Is there any reason why she…\" \"Has a terrible temper? Acts so entitled?\" Ryan supplies as Gabriella trails off, shrugging as she nods curiously. \"I think it\\'s probably because of our parents. They\\'ve always given us everything we\\'ve ever wanted and they\\'ve never told us no. Sharpay\\'s not used to not getting her way.\" Gabriella quirks an eyebrow. \"And you are?\" Ryan narrows his eyes for a fraction of a second, seeming as if he\\'s contemplating something, before shaking his head. \"I actually think you might be really good for her,\" he continues, ignoring Gabriella\\'s question. \"If not just to teach her that not everything will always work out in her favour.\" Gabriella purses her lips. She\\'s not sure that\\'s a lesson Sharpay wants to learn, though. Maybe that\\'s why she\\'s so averse to being friends, because Gabriella teaches her a lesson that she doesn\\'t want to learn. \"She could me teach me a lot, too, about confidence and about being on stage,\" Gabriella admits as she sees flashes of Sharpay\\'s rehearsal the other day before her. She was so confident, so at ease. Gabriella wishes she could be so comfortable in the spotlight. \"Well, I\\'m sure it takes some confidence to stand up to her,\" Ryan says encouragingly, before grimacing as Sharpay suddenly looks up from Kelsi and sees Ryan and Gabriella watching her. Her eyes immediately narrow in a suspicious glare and she starts walking towards them. Ryan shoots Gabriella an awkward smile. \"Well, I guess that\\'s my cue.\" Gabriella giggles. \"Well, it was nice to talk you while it lasted.\" Ryan laughs as he nods. \"Likewise. And seriously, thanks for standing up to her. She might not see it that way, but it\\'s really good for her.\" \"Not for me, though,\" Gabriella retorts and Ryan\\'s smile turns sympathetic. \"Sorry again,\" he says, before quickly stepping forward as Sharpay approaches their general vicinity. \"What\\'s going on here?\" Sharpay asks, and Ryan just smiles innocently. \"Nothing, I just needed to talk to Gabriella about a scene,\" he says, and Sharpay scowls suspiciously. However, before she can say anything, Ms. Darbus\\'s booming voice blasts through the auditorium again, asking everyone to start up rehearsals again. Sharpay just sighs and pulls Ryan with her. However, Ryan turns around and smiles at Gabriella one more time, which she returns. She may not understand Sharpay, but it does make her feel good that someone who does understand Sharpay is encouraging her, and implying that he, too, sees that she and Sharpay could help each other. Sharpay may not see it, but in the most messed up of ways, they really would be good for each other. In the most messed up of ways, they really are a match. It feels like déjà vu when Gabriella walks into the bathroom the next morning to find Sharpay there, fluffing her hair as she blows a kiss at the mirror. Not wanting to cause a scene again, Gabriella quickly moves towards the stalls, but as she glances in the mirror, she meets Sharpay\\'s gaze, and Sharpay raises her eyebrows when Gabriella\\'s eyes widen. \"I hope you\\'re not here to practice again, Gabriella. I told you that the acoustics are different than in the auditorium,\" Sharpay says, and Gabriella closes her eyes briefly as she lets go of the door she\\'s holding. Shaking her head, she says, \"No. I just needed to pee.\" Sharpay smiles sweetly. \"Great. Glad I won\\'t have to hear you wail while I fix my make-up.\" Her gaze moves back to her own reflection for a second, before meeting Gabriella\\'s again, a glint of a taunting present in her eyes, and it\\'s the second she sees that glint, that Gabriella finally snaps. The build-up has been too long, too intense, too frustrating. \"What is your deal?!\" It\\'s out before Gabriella can think twice, and it sounds much more exasperated than she intends it to be. As Sharpay\\'s eyes widen in a mixture of shock and curiosity, Gabriella sighs and averts her gaze, feeling her cheeks heat up. Sharpay quickly regains her composure, though. Turning around with a scathing scowl, she hisses, \"I could ask you the same thing, Ms. I\\'m-going-to-audition-last-minute-and-mess-up-the-entire-musical .\" Gabriella throws up her hands in despair. \"Do you want me to apologize for responding to Ms. Darbus\\'s call for auditions?\" \"No, I want you to apologize for ruining my life,\" Sharpay snaps, watching as Gabriella\\'s face morphs into a scowl that could rival her own. \"For the last time, I didn\\'t sign up with an intention to step on your toes. I\\'m sorry it happened on an impulse decision, but I\\'m not sorry for doing something I enjoy,\" Gabriella says, taking a step forward in Sharpay\\'s direction. Narrowing her eyes on the blonde, Gabriella continues, \"I really don\\'t get you. One minute, you\\'re actually being civil to me, and the next, you\\'re yelling at me more than ever.\" Sharpay takes a step forward, too, as she scoffs. \"Well, I do get you. You act like you\\'re so sincere and innocent, pretending to want to be my friend, but I think you hate me just as much as I hate you.\" \"I don\\'t hate you!\" Gabriella exclaims desperately. \"And if I did, it would only be because you are rude to me at every turn.\" Suddenly, Sharpay\\'s eyes light up and her scowl morphs into a satisfied smirk that makes a thrill go down Gabriella\\'s spine as she suddenly notices she\\'s breathing heavily. All this time, Sharpay has wanted a reaction out of her, to gain the upper hand, and Gabriella has never given in. But now, her frustration have reached a boiling point. Now, she\\'s angry and desperate and vulnerable to an attack. Suddenly, she\\'s aware of her surroundings. She\\'s in a public space, where anyone could hear, so close to Sharpay that she could practically feel Sharpay\\'s frustratingly calm breath on her face, and she\\'s losing her cool. This is not her. Gabriella is a lot of things – frustrated, scared, overwhelmed –, but she\\'s not angry. She\\'s not Sharpay. So, she just takes a deep breath in an effort to regain her composure and control, before shaking her head and sending Sharpay an exhausted and sad smile as she takes a step back, Sharpay blinking with slight panic as she also seems to realize their proximity. \"Look, I know you won\\'t ever agree with me, but I truly believe we are more alike than we think,\" Gabriella says, her voice a lot calmer and more quiet. \"You may be better at hiding it, but I think you\\'re just as scared and insecure as I am. And for some reason, I hoped that we could help each other, but I guess I\\'m wrong.\" Sharpay\\'s face displays incredulity, before flashing into panic and then into anger as she listens to Gabriella. Scowling, she folds her arms over her chest. \"I\\'m not scared and insecure,\" she states firmly, but Gabriella can sense the hint of panic in her voice as she tries to appear calm and firm. Furthermore, there\\'s a hint of vulnerability present in Sharpay\\'s eyes that Gabriella has never seen before, which tells Gabriella that she may not be so wrong after all. However, she finds that she doesn\\'t want to be right about this anymore. There\\'s a limit to this game of push and pull that they\\'ve been playing ever since they met, and Gabriella thinks she\\'s reached the end. So, as Sharpay raises an eyebrow challengingly, obviously expecting more fight, Gabriella merely shrugs and throws her hands up in defeat. \"You keep telling yourself that.\" Then, she turns around and walks out of the bathroom. And she doesn\\'t turn to look back. This was her last effort, Gabriella decides. She knows her hunch about them being not so different is right, but she\\'s done convincing Sharpay that they should try to get along. She\\'s done trying to become friends. Sharpay is not scared and insecure. How dare Gabriella insinuate that? How dare she insinuate that Sharpay is just putting on a façade, that she\\'s not as confident as she seems? Sharpay couldn\\'t be more confident if she tried. Some might even say she\\'s so confident that she\\'s arrogant or conceited. And they would be right. Furthermore, how could Gabriella possibly be scared and insecure? She\\'s certainly nervous and overwhelmed by all that the musical entails, but she\\'s definitely not insecure. Insecure people don\\'t go on stage and perform as dozens of other people watch. They don\\'t speak up and disagree with Sharpay in the middle of rehearsal. They don\\'t fight people with more power than them. Yet Gabriella has done all of those things. Which leads Sharpay to believe that the theory she\\'s developed since their private rehearsal in the auditorium is right – she and Gabriella are meant to stay far away from each other, and they hate each other equally. Which is a lot . This is why Sharpay should be rejoicing when Gabriella finally stumbles during rehearsals. It happens when Sharpay least expects it as well. Gabriella is meant to sing the solo that has been written for her – of course Kelsi tried to give Gabriella more to do –, which should be nothing out of the ordinary. Sharpay has seen her sing during the auditions, she\\'s heard her rehearse in the bathroom of all places, so what happens next is a complete surprise and leaves Sharpay utterly befuddled. Because as everyone waits expectantly for Gabriella to sing her song, she suddenly freezes. Sharpay quirks an eyebrow curiously as she watches Gabriella\\'s eyes nervously flick around and her mouth open, only for a chortling sound to come out instead of the required melody. It almost seems… as if she has stage fright. For a split second, this brand new knowledge fills Sharpay with utter joy. Finally, she has found a weakness of Gabriella\\'s that makes her incompatible with the stage. Finally, Sharpay can take her down. However, all her glee dissipates when Gabriella\\'s gaze meets hers and Sharpay suddenly feels a tremor run down her spine. Gabriella looks so small. She looks so scared and insecure. And then, she realizes with poignant clarity and a bitter reluctance, that Gabriella has been right all along. Because she recognizes that fear and insecurity. She would never show it in such an obvious sense, but it\\'s there, hidden away in the darkest depths of her soul. It\\'s a fear of not being good enough. And the knowledge that Gabriella harbours that same fear kind of annoys Sharpay. All of Sharpay\\'s hatred towards Gabriella has been because Gabriella is good. It\\'s because, deep down, she respects Gabriella, sees her as an equal – or at least, a person who has the potential to become an equal. She may hate Gabriella for constantly being in her way, but in a strange way, she realizes she actually can\\'t imagine her life anymore with the constant challenge that Gabriella brings, even after only knowing her for such a short period of time, and while that realization should scare her to death, it doesn\\'t. In a strange way, the challenge of Gabriella has become intoxicating rather than infuriating, and Sharpay thinks she might secretly like that. So, when Gabriella gasps and runs off stage, Sharpay\\'s first instinct isn\\'t to breathe a sigh of relief, but it\\'s to go after her. Sharpay may hate Gabriella, but she loves the challenge, and for some reason unbeknownst to her, she doesn\\'t want to lose that. At least, that\\'s what she tells herself. As she sees Kelsi move to stand up, she quickly gets up herself and shakes her head. \"I\\'ll go.\" She feels Ryan\\'s hand grab hers tightly. \"Shar…\" \"Don\\'t worry, Ry,\" she says, rather calmly, as she turns to look at him and she can see he doesn\\'t believe her, but she runs off anyway, moving in the direction where Gabriella has gone. She finds Gabriella just outside the auditorium, sitting against the wall and heaving as she has her head buried in her hands. As she hears Sharpay\\'s heels click against the floor, she looks up, with teary eyes, and her face falls even more as she realizes who has come after her. However, before she can say anything, Sharpay asks her, blithely, \"What the hell just happened in there?\" Gabriella averts her gaze and shrugs as she stares ahead. \"I got scared and I freaked out. I\\'m sure you\\'re really happy right now.\" Sharpay rolls her eyes as she crosses her arms over her chest. \"No, I\\'m just confused.\" As Gabriella looks back up, surprised, Sharpay continues, \"I\\'ve seen you perform before. I mean, yeah, you were nervous, but you\\'ve never seemed scared. Why were you scared now?\" Gabriella shrugs. \"I don\\'t know. I think it only happens when I can actually see people looking at me.\" \"You saw people look at you at the auditions,\" Sharpay retorts, and Gabriella\\'s eyebrows furrow thoughtfully as she stares ahead, as if contemplating something, before she shakes her head. \"Why did you come after me?\" she asks curiously, and Sharpay sighs as she purses her lips and averts her gaze. She really didn\\'t think this through. She can\\'t just tell Gabriella that she was worried or that she doesn\\'t hate her as much as she previously thought. \"I told you, I was confused,\" she says instead. \"I thought you were just speaking bull when you said you were scared and insecure. You\\'ve always seemed very… confident of your opinions and your stand against me, so I was surprised to see you so scared.\" Gabriella narrows her eyes at her and Sharpay can see the apprehension in those dark depths. Rightfully so, she thinks, as she has never given Gabriella any indication that she has any feelings towards her that aren\\'t overtly negative. Then, she laughs. \"I\\'m always scared, Sharpay. This is all new to me. I\\'m terrified I\\'m going to screw it up.\" And partially, it\\'s due to Sharpay. If this had been thirty minutes ago, she would be delighted to know that she has instilled this fear in Gabriella. Now, however, she feels strangely guilty about it. Sitting down next to her, but leaving more than enough space between them, Sharpay says, \"I don\\'t think you\\'re going to screw this up.\" Gabriella quirks an eyebrow. \"You\\'ve been telling me I\\'m screwing up since day one.\" \"You do realize that I hate you because you\\'re not screwing up, right?\" Sharpay asks, and Gabriella can\\'t help but smile at that. \"Are you saying I\\'m good?\" Sharpay bites her lip and sends her a glare, although playful rather than venomous, before saying, \"I\\'m saying that you challenge me.\" A short silence befalls them, Gabriella keeping her eyes trained as Sharpay averts her gaze, both knowing that there\\'s more to be said. With a deep sigh, Sharpay admits, \"I hate you because I respect you.\" After a pause, she turns back to Gabriella and reluctantly adds, \"I\\'m not the only person who\\'s good anymore and I will murder your entire family if you ever tell anyone I said this, but it scares me.\" Gabriella blinks, before biting her lip. \"So, we scare each other.\" There\\'s a hint of sorrow in her voice, and Sharpay feels it, too, as she nods. \"I guess so.\" Then, she narrows her eyes, before standing up. \"You know what? We could use this to our advantage.\" As Gabriella raises her eyebrows, Sharpay explains, \"I don\\'t know about you, Gabriella, but my desire to prove you that I\\'m good fuels me. The next time you get stage fright, just think about me, and how you\\'re going to prove me wrong.\" Suspiciously, Gabriella asks, \"And what is in it for you? Don\\'t you benefit from me screwing up?\" \"As I said, you challenge me. The better you get, the more I want to improve my own performance, so we both get better. You become better than average and I become outstanding.\" Somewhere in the back of Sharpay\\'s mind, alarm bells are going off as she speaks. Why is she extending an olive branch to Gabriella? Why is she helping her? Why is she admitting her weaknesses? She should keep Gabriella far away, like she originally intended, not get closer to her. Yet, there\\'s something inside her, a curious thrill of excitement that she cannot ignore, so she decides to push her thoughts away as she anxiously waits for Gabriella to respond. After a moment of contemplation, Gabriella giggles, squeakily but sweetly, before biting her lip. \"Does this mean a truce?\" Sharpay purses her lips, feeling slightly uncomfortable at how happy and hopeful Gabriella sounds and how that doesn\\'t infuriate her. \"I guess it does. We\\'re both tired of fighting anyway. Besides, frown lines are bad for you.\" Gabriella bursts into a brilliant grin, and a part of Sharpay launches into her usual reaction of frustration, but she pushes it away as she holds out a hand for Gabriella to shake. Gabriella stares at it for a second, before looking back up at Sharpay. \"So, are you going to stop insulting me?\" \"I won\\'t make promises about the occasional blunt remark, but yeah, sure, no more insults with ill intentions. As long as you don\\'t constantly shoot down my ideas.\" \"It happened once!\" Gabriella exclaims exasperatedly, but the smile is still present on her face. \"But yeah, sure.\" And then Gabriella\\'s soft hand lands in Sharpay\\'s and they shake firmly, Gabriella grinning goofily and Sharpay smirking in amusement. \"Great,\" Sharpay says as she drops Gabriella\\'s hand. \"Now come on, let\\'s get back before Ms. Darbus thinks we\\'ve murdered each other.\" Gabriella giggles again and nods as she stands up and follows Sharpay into the auditorium. Sharpay takes her seat again and smirks as Gabriella\\'s eyes lock on hers, a determined look in her eyes as she starts singing. As she feels Ryan\\'s suspicious eyes on her, Sharpay just shrugs and smiles while she tries not to overthink what she just did. Even though it\\'s mutually beneficial, she knows that maintaining this truce is going to be difficult. Perhaps it\\'s going to be an even bigger challenge than fighting with Gabriella. But she\\'s not one to back down. And deep down, she\\'s strangely excited about this new development in their relationship. Because that\\'s what Gabriella Montez does. She infuriates, but she excites as well. And Sharpay is ready to take this new challenge on. A/N: What I wanted to do here is try to focus more on the fact that Gabriella and Sharpay really do challenge each other, and that they\\'re more alike than they think, and try to put that in a positive light. I hope the characterization makes sense! As always, I love you if you leave reviews!'][Chapter 7] ['Things are starting to look up. Gabriella had never thought she\\'d reach a truce with Sharpay, not after their fight in the bathroom, but when she walks into school the morning after she got stage fright during rehearsal, the first thing she\\'s greeted with is a courteous nod from Sharpay. They\\'re not friends, not by any means, but their truce is a start. Furthermore, she\\'s grateful to have someone to look out for when she has stage fright, as strange as it is that this person is Sharpay. The truth is that Gabriella needs that. She needs someone to challenge her, to give her the courage to sing and stand up on stage. As much as she\\'s learning about being on stage, her stage fright isn\\'t just solved in the blink of an eye. So far, Troy has been the one to encourage her, to give her faith when she needed it most, both at the New Year\\'s Eve party and at the auditions. However, Troy is not always going to be present, especially as he was too afraid to audition himself. So yesterday, when she choked, it seemed like she was alone. She couldn\\'t be more wrong. The thing is, though, that Sharpay encourages her in an entirely different way than Troy does. While Troy\\'s presence is comforting, Sharpay\\'s is daring. As Sharpay put it herself, they challenge each other to outdo one another. In the strangest of ways, their rivalry is helping both of them. And now they\\'ve both realized that, it\\'s not a rivalry anymore. At least, not in an actually hostile sense. Now, it\\'s more like they\\'re frenemies. And after all of their fights, Gabriella thinks that\\'s the way it should be. Not friends, not enemies. Just something else. Gabriella arrives at her locker with a spring in her step, waving as she sees Taylor standing by it, and grinning as she removes the lock. \"You\\'re in a good mood,\" Taylor comments, smiling and sounding a little amused and Gabriella just giggles. \"Yeah, I just feel good today.\" \"Well, I\\'m glad,\" Taylor says earnestly, before the grin falls off her face and she curses. \"Oh, shit, Gabriella, Sharpay is coming this way.\" Gabriella turns around to watch Sharpay approach with menacing strides. However, Gabriella can see that there\\'s no anger in her eyes, so she just watches curiously as Sharpay stops right in front of her and musters a slightly forced smile. \"You\\'re gonna sit with us at lunch today,\" she says, before rolling her eyes as both Gabriella and Taylor raise their eyebrows. \"I mean, do you want to sit with us at lunch today? Ryan, Kelsi and I were planning to go over a few scenes and I figured you\\'d want to join, too, since you play the biggest supporting character.\" Gabriella narrows her eyes, before smiling. \"You want to have lunch together?\" Sharpay rolls her eyes again. \"Ryan and Kelsi are there too, and they both actually like you for some reason. And again, I\\'m only inviting you, because you play an important role in the musical.\" Tapping her foot impatiently on the floor, she adds, \"So, what\\'s it gonna be?\" Gabriella bites her lip, sneaking a glance at a horrified Taylor, before nodding and offering Sharpay a small smile. \"Why not?\" Sharpay smiles and stands up a little straighter. \"Great! Well, I guess I\\'ll be on my way then. Toodles!\" Gabriella giggles at Sharpay\\'s little wave, returning it and watching as Sharpay struts off. \"What was that?!\" Gabriella sighs as she turns back to Taylor, shrugging. \"We called a truce.\" Taylor quirks an eyebrow. \"So, you and Sharpay are friends now?\" \"Definitely not,\" Gabriella laughs. \"But we respect each other.\" Taylor snorts. \"Sharpay Evans, respecting others? She\\'s playing you, Gabriella.\" Gabriella frowns as she closes her locker. \"I mean, yeah, I don\\'t entirely trust her, but she told me she respects me and she seemed genuine enough.\" As uncertain as she still is about her future with Sharpay, she does know Sharpay well enough by now to know when she\\'s trying to manipulate her. The way she behaved yesterday, however, was different, more genuine, in a way that Gabriella hasn\\'t seen yet. She doesn\\'t trust Sharpay\\'s general motives, but she does trust that Sharpay was being honest when she wanted a truce. Taylor doesn\\'t seem to agree, though, for she scoffs. \"Sharpay doesn\\'t respect anyone but herself.\" \"I know her. She was speaking the truth, I could tell,\" Gabriella counters, a little defensively, and in the back of her mind, she wonders why she\\'s suddenly so defensive of the person who tried to make her life a living hell just yesterday. \"You\\'ve only known her a couple of weeks,\" Taylor counters, smiling sympathetically as Gabriella\\'s face falls further – it\\'s true, after all. \"Look, if you believe she really wants a truce, then who am I to say she doesn\\'t? Just don\\'t let down your guard, okay? Nothing is that simple with her.\" Gabriella sighs, before nodding, suddenly not feeling so happy anymore as she is overcome with worries. She has already entertained the thought, of course, but what if Taylor is right and Sharpay really is only calling this truce to perform a sneak attack and get her down when she least expects it? What if it\\'s all just a ploy? Sharpay is a great actress after all. And why does the possibility of this being a ruse break her heart? Why does she still want to genuinely get along with Sharpay, after the cruel way she treated her? Why does she want to stay close to her, spend time with her? It makes no sense. Then again, nothing that has happened since she has arrived at East High has made sense. She just hopes that Taylor isn\\'t right and that this will work out. She hopes that this truce will last. Sharpay is sure she\\'s made a big mistake by asking Gabriella to join her, Ryan and Kelsi for lunch. Not only is the incident from the day of the cast list still fresh on her mind, but spending time together outside of musical rehearsals and the occasional unfortunate meeting in the bathroom means they\\'re getting friendly and a little bit too close. So, to see Gabriella sitting at her lunch table, with a big smile as she converses with Ryan, Sharpay feels uncomfortable. Gabriella seems so at ease. She seems to fit right in, in their little group, and it makes Sharpay feel threatened again. She still doesn\\'t like change, and she doesn\\'t like letting new people into her life, especially people like Gabriella. However, she tries to keep in her fury and fear, just picking at her food quietly as she watches Gabriella\\'s arms flutter around as she talks, before she throws her head back in laughter. \"Are you okay, sis?\" Ryan\\'s voice snaps her out of her daze and Sharpay blinks as she realizes she\\'s just been staring at Gabriella for a few minutes. She nods, forcing a smile onto her face. \"Yeah, sorry, I zoned out for a minute.\" Then, she sits up a little straighter. \"So, shall we rehearse?\" Ryan nods slowly, before all four of them dive towards their bags to retrieve their scripts. \"So, what scenes did you want to practice?\" Sharpay bites her lip as her gaze flickers to Gabriella, who is still smiling sweetly and a little excitedly. She needs to distract herself from Gabriella\\'s presence. \"Maybe the scene where Arnold and Minnie try to escape from the dungeon?\" she suggests. The other three all hum in agreement, as they flip through their scripts to find the scene in question, and Sharpay breathes out a sigh as she hopes her mind will be taken off Gabriella now. Of course, it isn\\'t. All through the read-through, as much as she tries to focus on her script and on Ryan, Sharpay can feel those chocolate eyes drill through her head, and when every time her gaze flickers to Gabriella and their eyes meet, she smiles a little wider. \"That was great! I don\\'t think this scene needs any extra practice!\" Gabriella exclaims as the twins finish the scene. \"Yeah, it\\'s a good scene, Kelsi,\" Sharpay admits reluctantly, not looking up from her script as she starts to flip through it to find another scene to rehearse. Anything to keep herself distracted and to keep herself from getting chummy with Gabriella. \"So, do you have these lunch rehearsals often?\" Of course, Gabriella does want to become chummy. Sharpay shrugs. \"Well, yeah, extra rehearsals are really useful if you want to be successful.\" \"Usually, we do them after school, though, but Sharpay is a little busy these days, because she has to improve her math grade,\" Ryan pipes up, before cowering as Sharpay sends him a poisonous look. \"Ryan!\" Sharpay is not someone who particularly cares about academics, but it is embarrassing that Gabriella now knows that she\\'s failing math. Gabriella, with her newspaper articles about winning academic awards, will probably judge her. She\\'ll probably think Sharpay\\'s an idiot, and that she is superior. At least, that\\'s what Sharpay would think if the roles were reversed. However, Gabriella is quite obviously not Sharpay, for she springs up immediately, her face lighting up. \"I could help and tutor you if you want to.\" Sharpay furrows her eyebrows suspiciously. \"Why would you want to do that?\" Gabriella shrugs. \"You\\'re helping me with the musical. I would like to return the favour.\" Sharpay scoffs. \"I don\\'t think giving you snide remarks to rile you up counts as helping.\" Gabriella smiles at that and rolls her eyes playfully. \"Fair point. But honestly, I just want to help.\" \"Thanks, but I can do it by myself,\" Sharpay responds curtly, before biting her lip as Gabriella\\'s face falls. The thing is, she actually does need the help, but she\\'s too proud to admit it, and she doesn\\'t like the idea of being dependent on Gabriella or spending more time with her than is necessary. However, as she sneaks a glance at Ryan, who is giving her a disapproving look, she realizes that it would be foolish to turn this offer down. So, she rolls her eyes as she begrudgingly says, \"Fine. You can help me if you want to.\" \"I\\'m doing this for you, not for me,\" Gabriella reminds her, a smile blossoming on her face. \"When do we start?\" Sharpay purses her lips. \"Do you have time this afternoon?\" Maybe it\\'s best if they get all this tutoring out of the way as soon as possible. Gabriella grins excitedly as she nods vigorously in agreement and Sharpay returns it with her own forced smile. \"Fabulous!\" Sharpay exclaims with faux-excitement, before turning back to her script. \"So, how about we practice Arnold and Minnie\\'s first meeting?\" And with that, the subject is changed and the topic of the tutoring never approached again during lunch. However, Sharpay\\'s heart still beats a little faster at the idea and panic overcomes her. But as she glances at a smiling Gabriella, she realizes there\\'s no way back now. Gabriella is getting more and more entangled in her life and she can\\'t stop it. She can\\'t stop Gabriella from coming too close. Sharpay Evans is in Gabriella\\'s bedroom. In a strange turn of events, she has offered Sharpay to tutor her in math and Sharpay actually accepted. Gabriella was happy about that initially, thrilled even, because it only confirmed to her that Sharpay is just as serious about their truce as she is, but now, to see Sharpay sitting on her bed, inspecting every inch of her room, she feels slightly uncomfortable. She suddenly feels like she needs everything to go perfectly this afternoon, so she can impress Sharpay, so Sharpay will want to come over more often. She\\'s still confused as to why she wants to spend so much time with the drama queen. \"Would you like some tea?\" Gabriella offers, fiddling with her hands as Sharpay\\'s gaze snaps to hers. \"I could also make coffee for you if you want and we have soda and orange juice. I also think my mom has made brownies and otherwise, I\\'m sure we have cookies somewhere.\" \"Just water, please. No food, thanks,\" Sharpay responds curtly, before quirking an eyebrow. \"Why are you so nervous? Have you never had fr– classmates over before?\" Gabriella smiles a little as she hears Sharpay\\'s slip of tongue, but decides to let it slide, shrugging in response to her question. \"I\\'ve moved every semester for the past five years, so I\\'ve never really had the chance to bond with anyone before.\" \"I wouldn\\'t call this bonding,\" Sharpay reminds her, before smirking. \"So, I\\'m guessing you\\'ll leave again in a couple of months?\" Sharpay\\'s voice is teasing, so Gabriella just rolls her eyes playfully as she says, \"Sorry, no such luck. My mom promised I\\'m not moving again until graduation.\" \"Bless mom\\'s heart,\" Sharpay remarks sarcastically, making Gabriella laugh, before she moves off of the bed. \"Well, make yourself comfortable, I\\'ll be back in a moment.\" When she returns with a cup of tea and a glass of water a few minutes later, she\\'s shocked to find Sharpay rummaging through her closet, half of the contents lying on the floor. \"What are you doing?!\" Sharpay turns around, hand on her hip as she motions around with her hand. \"What does it look like I\\'m doing? I\\'m going through your closet. Your style is quite terrible, Gabriella.\" She picks up a pair of green corduroy pants, making gagging noises as Gabriella sets down the drinks and frowns as she approaches and rips the pants from Sharpay\\'s hands. \"What\\'s wrong with these?\" she asks and Sharpay merely shakes her head pitifully. \"Oh, honey, they\\'re atrocious.\" Turning back to the closet, she taps her chin. \"You need a new wardrobe, stat.\" \"And you\\'re gonna help me with that?\" Gabriella asks, raising an eyebrow as she suddenly feels suspicious. Sharpay was reluctant to agree to being tutored, and she didn\\'t seem overjoyed to spend time with her anyway, so why would she willingly do this? There has to be something behind it. \"I have no ulterior motives,\" Sharpay states, as if reading her mind. \"The fashionista in me can\\'t stand the sight of this. And also, I hate that I owe you one for tutoring me.\" \"But I told you, you\\'re helping me with the musical, and I\\'m not expecting anything in return anyway.\" Sharpay whines and stomps her foot. \"Gabriella, just let me do this, please. I can\\'t just walk away and let you continue to live like this.\" Then, she turns to Gabriella, before widening her eyes and pouting. It\\'s rather adorable. \"Fine,\" Gabriella admits, sighing as Sharpay jumps up and down and claps her hands excitedly, the glitters on her white shirt nearly blinding Gabriella. \"But no glitters, please.\" \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find stuff that fits you. I\\'m great at that. I do it for Ryan, too,\" Sharpay says as she picks up the pants again. \"But seriously, what were you thinking?\" With a roll of her eyes, Gabriella grabs the pants from Sharpay\\'s grasp and throws them down. \"Okay, enough procrastination. Let\\'s get to math!\" Sharpay grimaces as she walks back to Gabriella\\'s bed. \"I don\\'t get how anyone would be this excited about math.\" Gabriella smiles as she shrugs and sits down on the bed besides Sharpay and opens her book. \"I\\'m the freaky math girl after all.\" Sharpay hums thoughtfully. \"Freaky math girl. I like that.\" \"Don\\'t use it against me.\" Sharpay has no idea what came over her to offer Gabriella to take her shopping. She wanted to spend less time with her, not more. However, she couldn\\'t deny her instincts to go snooping around Gabriella\\'s room when she was in there alone the other day and what she found in her closet was truly atrocious. And the thing is, as much as Sharpay would deny it if ever asked, Gabriella is a pretty girl. She just doesn\\'t dress like it and Sharpay can\\'t stand around and let a pretty girl hide herself in ugly clothing. It\\'s against everything she stands for and she refuses not take this challenge. So, now she\\'s impatiently waiting as Gabriella tries on the many clothes that she has picked out for her, hoping that it will be an improvement. She doesn\\'t realize how much of an improvement it is until Gabriella comes out of the fitting room, wearing a white top with frills and a pair of jeans. It\\'s not much different from the clothes Gabriella wears on a daily basis – just a little more sophisticated –, but still, Sharpay\\'s breath hitches in her throat as Gabriella stands in front of the mirror and inspects her own appearance. The girl is not just pretty, Sharpay thinks, she\\'s gorgeous . With those black waves cascading down her back, and those pretty brown eyes, and her slight curves, and her long legs, she\\'s stunning. It makes Sharpay\\'s heart beat a little faster as she feels an unfamiliar feeling overcome her. She chalks it up to envy – Gabriella is great at everything, of course she\\'s also great at being pretty –, and blinks a couple of times as she tries to regain her composure and slow down her heart. \"I like this,\" Gabriella comments as she puts her hands on her butt – why can\\'t Sharpay take her eyes off her butt now? – and inspects her backside thoroughly. \"Does it look okay?\" \"It looks fabulous,\" Sharpay answers immediately, and Gabriella blinks at the speed and firmness of her answer. \"See, I told you I\\'m good at this.\" Gabriella\\'s eyes meet Sharpay\\'s through the mirror and she smiles, nodding as she softly says, \"Yeah, you\\'re great.\" Sharpay doesn\\'t know why she suddenly feels her cheeks heat up at the genuine sweetness in Gabriella\\'s voice, quickly averting her gaze and clenching her jaw as she wills herself to cool down. \"Get back in there and try on one of those dresses,\" she says, a little tensely, and from the corner of her eye, she can see Gabriella\\'s confusion as she slowly nods and walks back into the fitting room. As she\\'s in there, Sharpay succeeds to even her breathing, but she\\'s rendered breathless quite soon again as Gabriella steps out again after a few minutes, now wearing a beautiful red dress. The sight makes Sharpay gulp. \"I don\\'t know if I like this,\" Gabriella admits, frowning as she looks down at her dress and wipes down the skirt. \"I don\\'t think I can pull it off.\" That snaps Sharpay out of her daze. She shakes her head firmly as she stands up and walks up to Gabriella, putting her finger under her chin and making her look back up. \"It\\'s all about confidence,\" she says, before gently brushing a finger against the soft skin of Gabriella\\'s shoulder, Gabriella shivering under her touch. \"You\\'re better than you think you are. That\\'s the entire reason I hated you.\" Gabriella\\'s eyes widen. \"You used past tense.\" Sharpay rolls her eyes, pushing away her discomfort at the awe on Gabriella\\'s face. \"I still don\\'t like you, but hate is too strong a word. But that\\'s besides the point. This dress is beautiful on you. You\\'re beautiful. You\\'ve just got to believe in it. Or at least pretend you do.\" As their eyes meet again through the mirror, Gabriella narrows her eyes for a fraction of a second, before smiling. \"That\\'s easier said than done, but thanks anyway.\" Then, she moves away and walks back into the fitting room, leaving an overwhelmed Sharpay behind again. They leave the store an hour later, packed with many of the clothes that Sharpay picked out for Gabriella, including the red dress, which Sharpay insisted on buying for Gabriella in case she changed her mind. As they walk in the cold February air, Sharpay can feel Gabriella\\'s eyes on her and it makes her feel on edge. However, before she can say anything, Gabriella speaks up first. \"Thanks for your help today,\" she says, sounding earnestly grateful. \"And thanks for calling me beautiful. I\\'m not nearly as beautiful as you, though.\" Sharpay rolls her eyes as she suppresses another blush. \"I know.\" As she looks over at Gabriella, the brunette is staring at the ground. \"Thanks for your compliment, though,\" Sharpay continues, smiling, and Gabriella looks up and returns it, warmth radiating from her smile. And, in that moment, Sharpay realizes that spending time with Gabriella is more enjoyable than she thought. Maybe taking her shopping was not such a bad idea after all. Gabriella\\'s vocals are improving. Sharpay hadn\\'t expected any different – as inexperienced as Gabriella was initially, Sharpay would be lying if she didn\\'t see the same potential that everyone else sees. And while Gabriella\\'s talent originally threatened her, because she wasn\\'t the only talented one anymore, she now feels threatened because she\\'s truly starting to feel a strange fondness for her. That fond feeling she had that day they went shopping has only grown since then, and now, watching Gabriella sing for her, standing a little taller than before and sing a little louder, a little less nasally, Sharpay feels her heart beat erratically again. As much as she\\'s reluctantly beginning to enjoy Gabriella\\'s company, she would really like that feeling of panic to dissipate. \"You\\'re getting better,\" Sharpay comments after Gabriella finishes singing. \"You should really try do some vocal exercises, though.\" As Gabriella\\'s eyebrows furrow in confusion and she shakes her head, Sharpay suppresses an eyeroll at the girl\\'s inexperience, before standing up and launching into her own vocal exercises. \"Brrr, brrr, brrr.\" Gabriella watches with raised eyebrows, amused, as Sharpay makes sounds and lets her hands flutter around her and Sharpay glowers at her as she finishes. \"Don\\'t laugh at me. They help you regulate your breathing,\" she explains curtly. \"Try.\" Gabriella tentatively copies the movements and sounds that Sharpay just displayed, before letting out a giggle as she finishes them. \"They\\'re kind of weird.\" Sharpay ignores her. \"Let\\'s try them together.\" As they do them again simultaneously, their gazes are locked on each other and Sharpay has to admit it, it does feel kind of strange to be doing this with Gabriella. However, she\\'s a professional and this is just an ordinary practice, so she keeps a straight face as she averts her gaze from Gabriella and trains it on a random point in space. However, when they finish again, Sharpay\\'s eyes flicker back to Gabriella, whose grinning widely, and she can\\'t help but join as Gabriella bursts into giggles again. It\\'s strangely exhilarating, to be laughing with Gabriella, about nothing. Just laughing, laughing, laughing. \"Okay, let\\'s get back to the song,\" Sharpay says as their laughter ceases. \"Maybe we could sing together? I could start and show you how it\\'s supposed to be done, and you could join in?\" Who is this person and what has she done with Sharpay Evans? Why is she genuinely trying to help Gabriella? Why is she singing together with her? Ever since the day they spent shopping, Sharpay has found she wants to spend time with Gabriella, and it\\'s very confusing, but she has to admit, it\\'s all worth it to see Gabriella\\'s eyes lighting up like that. \"That would be great!\" she exclaims, and Sharpay offers her a small smile, before grabbing her sheet music and starting to sing the first few verses of the song. Gabriella joins in the chorus, and Sharpay decides to take the higher part so they can harmonize, before feeling a thrill run down her spine as she realizes how good they sound together. As different as they are, their voices fit together perfectly, creating a beautiful harmony. Gabriella seems to notice it as well, her eyes twinkling as they sing together, to each other, and Sharpay feels a strange feeling in her stomach, as she can\\'t keep her eyes off her. As they finish the song, Sharpay gulps and Gabriella blinks in shock as she suddenly averts her gaze, her cheeks painted a rosy pink. \"We sound good together,\" she mumbles shyly, and Sharpay\\'s eyes cast downward as she gulps again and nods. \"We do.\" They stay quiet for a minute, unsure what to say and where to look, before Gabriella suddenly hurries to the side of the stage to find her back. \"You know what, I have to go,\" she says. \"I\\'m supposed to meet Tr– Taylor.\" Quickly placing her sheet music in her bag, she stands up, smiling in a forced manner as she waves awkwardly. \"See you tomorrow!\" \"Toodles!\" Sharpay musters, still feeling dazed as she waves back and watches Gabriella all but run out of the auditorium. However, before she appears out of sight, she turns around and offers Sharpay a genuine smile. \"Thanks for the help with the vocal exercises.\" Sharpay musters a small smile in return. \"You\\'re welcome.\" And then she\\'s gone and Sharpay is left behind, alone with her anxieties. Why does she keep having these moments with Gabriella? What the hell is going on? Sharpay\\'s house is impressive, to say the least. Gabriella already knew that the Evans twins were loaded, but she had no idea how wealthy they truly are until now, standing in the grand foyer of their huge mansion. \"Let\\'s go upstairs,\" Sharpay says as she hands their coats to the butler – they have a butler! –, and climbs up the giant staircase. Gabriella follows suit, trying not to seem too much in awe at the indescribable grandeur surrounding her. Sharpay\\'s room, though, is easy to describe. It\\'s pink. The room is huge, like everything else in the house, and everywhere Gabriella looks, she\\'s bombarded with the bright colour, from every wall to every piece of furniture. \"Impressed?\" Sharpay asks, amused and a little smug, as Gabriella\\'s gaze roams around the room. \"Yeah, kind of,\" Gabriella admits with a shrug as her eyes meet Sharpay\\'s as the blonde sits down on the bed. \"You really weren\\'t kidding when you said you were wealthy.\" \"Yeah, there\\'s perks to being part of the New Mexico Evans,\" Sharpay agrees as she gets back up and walks over to her – obviously pink – desk to grab her math textbook and a notepad, an obvious hint that she doesn\\'t want to discuss this topic any further. It\\'s strange – Sharpay has seemed like she was warming up to her for a while, but now she\\'s distant again, but in a different way. It seems like it\\'s not that she doesn\\'t want to be around her, but it\\'s like she doesn\\'t know how to be. However, Gabriella still wants to get to know Sharpay, as she\\'s still inexplicably drawn to her, so she decides to continue the conversation. \"Is your dad away a lot for business?\" she asks as she, too, sits down on the bed and grabs her own text book. Sharpay shrugs, not looking up as she starts scribbling on the notepad. \"Yeah, Daddy travels a lot, and mother often joins as well. They always brings home nice gifts, though, so we know they\\'re always thinking about us.\" Gabriella bites her lip as she\\'s reminded of her conversation with Ryan a while ago. So, this is what he meant when he said their parents don\\'t say no to them. They spoil Sharpay and Ryan rotten to make up for being distant parents. As much as her mother has caused Gabriella to move around a lot and never find roots, she could never imagine just being left on her own with butlers and other staff by her own parent. It makes her pity Sharpay, which Sharpay obviously seems to notice, as she\\'s suddenly glowering at her, her homework forgotten. \"Don\\'t feel sorry for me, I\\'m fine. I have everything I could ever need,\" she snaps and Gabriella smiles and shakes her head. \"I just think it\\'s hard not to have your parents always near,\" she explains. \"I know how it feels.\" Sharpay\\'s glare dissipates, replaced by a thoughtful look. \"Yeah, now you mention it, you\\'re always talking about your mom and never about your dad.\" Gabriella looks down at her book, still closed, her lip quivering as she says, \"Yeah, he died when I was twelve.\" \"Oh, I\\'m so sorry,\" Sharpay says, sounding a little bit shocked, but also earnestly pitiful. \"You must miss him a lot. I mean, I miss my daddy, too, but at least he\\'s coming back.\" \"Yeah, I do miss him a lot,\" Gabriella admits, smiling wistfully. \"I wish he could see me now, being a musical star and all.\" \"I\\'m the star, you\\'re just a supporting role,\" Sharpay reminds her, not at all viciously, before mustering a small smile. \"I\\'m sure he\\'d be proud of you, though.\" \"I hope so.\" For a moment, they stare into each other\\'s eyes as they smile, before Sharpay blinks dazedly and averts her gaze, instead focusing on her math textbook. However, Gabriella can\\'t take her attention off Sharpay, watching as the blonde scrunches up her face rather adorably as she tries to solve the math problems before her. Gabriella still doesn\\'t understand why she\\'s so intrigued by Sharpay – even if they\\'re becoming something akin to friends, nearly everything that has transpired between them is a sign that Gabriella should stay far away from her. Yet she wants to know more, spend more time with her, be close to her. Yet they share these moments, where time seems to be frozen around them and all that exists is the other person, and Gabriella feels a strange uneasy yet pleasant feeling in her stomach. It reminds her of something, or rather someone , but that thought – one of blue eyes – just makes it all the more confusing. \"Okay, I think I\\'ve got it,\" Sharpay sighs, snapping Gabriella out of her daze and narrows her eyes suspiciously as she catches her staring. Gabriella tucks a strand of hair behind her ear before scooting closer to Sharpay to inspect the work. Shaking her head, she points at the notepad. \"You have to do the exponentiation first before the multiplication.\" \"Oh, right,\" Sharpay murmurs, before returning to her notepad and starting to scribble again. \"God, this is boring.\" Gabriella lets out a giggle at Sharpay\\'s obvious frustration as she watches her correct her mistake. However, she can see it\\'s still wrong. \"No, like this.\" As she moves in to grab the pencil from Sharpay\\'s grasp, their hands brush and it suddenly feels as if a spark of electricity is released, a spark travelling up her arm and straight to her heart. Gabriella\\'s eyes widen as she looks back up to Sharpay, who looks similarly shocked as she completely freezes. For a second, they stare at each other, unable to grasp what just happened, both chests heaving up and down with panic, their face remaining so close that Gabriella can feel Sharpay\\'s huffs of breaths on her cheek. Out of their own volition, Gabriella\\'s eyes flick down to Sharpay\\'s pink lips, staring for a second before she suddenly snaps out her daze and shakes her head, turning back to the notepad as she tries to get her breathing under control. \"You see, what you\\'re doing wrong is–\" \"You should go.\" Looking back up, Gabriella feels a slight pang in her heart as she notices Sharpay has recoiled. It hurts a little, to see Sharpay pull away like that, but of course it was bound to happen. Sharpay was bound to realize that their truce – their friendship – was a bad idea. It was bound to fall apart. Gabriella was bound to get hurt. So, Gabriella bites her lip as she feels tears well in her eyes, before nodding and hopping off the bed, quickly grabbing her stuff and wordlessly putting it in her bag as she feels Sharpay\\'s eyes follow her every wave. \"Bye,\" Gabriella mumbles as she flees from the room, all but running through the corridor to find the giant staircase from before. As she finds it, she quickly travels downstairs, wordlessly travelling through the front door that a confused butler opens for her. As soon as she\\'s outside, she lets out a breath she doesn\\'t know she has been holding as she registers what just happened. The spark that travelled between them was so strong . It still makes no sense. Sharpay was right all along – they were never meant to be friends. It was always meant to end in pain. Thus, Gabriella takes one last look at the mansion, before running off the long driveway, leaving Sharpay and their relationship behind. A/N: One step forward, two steps backward, I guess? Sorry, lmao. Anyway, we\\'re getting to the confusing feelings now and I\\'m excited! We\\'re also getting to the cliché tropes, though, but you know what? There\\'s barely any Gabpay fic, so I don\\'t care, Gabpay deserves cliché scenes where they shop together and tutor each other! As always, please leave reviews, those make me so happy!'][Chapter 8] ['Sharpay can feel Gabriella\\'s eyes on her. She can feel those brown orbs drilling holes through her head, as if Gabriella is trying to figure out something, as if she\\'s trying to figure her out. It makes Sharpay feel on edge, and it makes her heart beat fast – a regular occurrence around Gabriella these days, a fact which she has no interest in dissecting further – as she tries to concentrate on her math problem. It\\'s a fairly easy one, but she still manages to get it wrong, watching with displeasure as Gabriella patiently explains her mistake. The thing is that she can\\'t concentrate on the math when Gabriella is around. Whenever Gabriella is around, she\\'s the only thing that Sharpay has the ability to pay attention to. She could easily solve this problem if that gorgeous head of dark curls was not so close to her. Grumbling, Sharpay goes back to her notepad, trying to fix the mistake that Gabriella pointed out, but it\\'s no use. She\\'s hopelessly overwhelmed by the fact that Gabriella Montez is in her room, a speck of blue in her sea of pink, and she hates that it\\'s making her lose her edge, her perfection. Gabriella, however, doesn\\'t seem to care that Sharpay keeps screwing up, leaning over as she softly says, \"No, like this.\" And then it happens. It only occurs in the blink of an eye, but it shakes Sharpay to her very core. Gabriella\\'s fingers brush over Sharpay\\'s hand as she tries to retrieve her pencil and suddenly, Sharpay\\'s entire body is set on fire, a scorching heat burning through her veins. Both of them snapping back in shock, they stare at each other, unsure how to proceed, unsure how to act. Gabriella\\'s eyes are wide and terrified, and Sharpay can see that her chest is heaving up and down with the same breathlessness that she is experiencing herself. They\\'re sitting so close too, and Sharpay swears she can count Gabriella\\'s long eyelashes as they continue to be frozen, their eyes remaining in contact. But then, Gabriella unfreezes for just a moment, her eyes flickering down to Sharpay\\'s lips, and Sharpay\\'s eyes follow suit to look at Gabriella\\'s lips, soft and agape, and she has no idea why she does what she does next, but she can\\'t hold in her emotions any longer. Leaping at Gabriella, she fuses her lips to hers, Gabriella grunting in surprise, before her hand flutters up to stroke the back of Sharpay\\'s head as she kisses her back. Gabriella\\'s lips are soft, so incredibly soft, and they taste vaguely like strawberry lipgloss. Sharpay thinks she might have ascended to some form of heaven when Gabriella scoots closer and grabs Sharpay\\'s hand with her free one, intertwining them in a perfect fit. Sharpay\\'s own hand grabs Gabriella\\'s hip, squeezing passionately, and Gabriella sighs into the kiss in response. Soon, the kiss slows down and they pull away, both wide-eyed and panting as they realize what they had just done. Sharpay should be freaking out, sending Gabriella away, insisting that this was a mistake and that it never happened. Yet, as she sees a spark light up in Gabriella\\'s eyes, she does the exact opposite of what she is supposed to be doing. Placing her hands on Gabriella\\'s waist, she watches as Gabriella\\'s sparkle turns into fiery desire before their lips lock again, even more passionately than before. Sharpay can\\'t think straight anymore. She can\\'t think about the consequences, about how she shouldn\\'t be doing this, about how she is not supposed to feel this way about Gabriella Montez. All she can think about is those soft lips. So, with a sigh, she lets herself go. With a gasp, Sharpay awakes and sits straight up in her bed, her heart beating erratically and her breath irregular as she pulls the sleeping mask off of her face. That dream was so vivid, so real. It was like Gabriella\\'s lips were actually on hers. This is ridiculous. She can\\'t be having these kinds of dreams about Gabriella. She can\\'t be having these kinds of feelings. It\\'s not right. She should hate – or at the very least dislike – Gabriella, she shouldn\\'t want to be feel her body warmth close to hers. Yet she so desperately wishes that what happened in that dream could have been what happened in reality, instead of the rational part of her brain taking over and sending Gabriella away the second that Gabriella glanced at her lips. It was the right thing to do, but the hurt on Gabriella\\'s face was palpable and for once, Gabriella\\'s hurt didn\\'t make feel Sharpay feel delighted or smug, but it made her want to take all of the girl\\'s worries away. By kissing her senseless. God, why ? Why would she develop a desire for Gabriella Montez of all people? What did she do to deserve this? And what does it mean? Does it mean that she has actual feelings for Gabriella? Or did she just carried away, caught up in the moment, and was she just so shaken up by the moment they shared that she now can\\'t get over it? It\\'s probably the latter, Sharpay decides. She\\'s probably been too weirded out by what transpired between them, and that\\'s why she had that dream. Through all the confusion and panic, though, one thing is crystal clear – Gabriella is no good for her. She needs to protect her sanity. She needs to do what she should have done in the first place and keep her distance. No more helping each other with the musical and math homework, no more shopping sprees, no more acting like they\\'re friends. The truce is over, Sharpay thinks as she pulls her sleeping mask back into place and lies back down, turning to lie on her side as she closes her eyes. She\\'s going to stay far away from Gabriella. That is the only way to keep her sanity. That is the only way for things to be alright again. And with that thought, Sharpay falls back into slumber and unwelcome dreams about Gabriella\\'s lips. Even after making the decision to forget about Gabriella, Sharpay can\\'t seem to do it. The next morning, as she absentmindedly bites into an apple for breakfast, she still can\\'t erase the memory of what happened the day before or that dream – oh, that dream! – from her mind. Besides her, Ryan is munching on his cereal, as he hums to himself joyfully, oblivious to Sharpay\\'s inner turmoil. She wishes she could talk to him about this. She wishes she could tell him, the way that they always tell each other everything, but something is keeping her from doing so. She\\'s too embarrassed and too confused to even broach the subject, and while that is not Ryan\\'s fault – it\\'s just her stupid pride or her stupid fear or both –, it makes her feel even worse that she feels like she can\\'t talk about it, that she\\'s keeping such a huge secret from him. Especially since he knows he won\\'t judge. He never judges her, unless she\\'s being malicious, and she never judges him. When he told her his deepest secret, one not unlike the one she\\'s carrying with her right now, she didn\\'t judge him or love him any less. She just sat there, held him, and spoke encouraging words, and she knows he would do the same for her. But it\\'s not that part of the secret, of these feelings, that she can\\'t tell Ryan about. It\\'s that it\\'s Gabriella Montez . \"What are you think about?\" Ryan\\'s voice suddenly snaps her out her thoughts, and Sharpay blinks as she looks back up from the half-eaten apple she\\'s been staring at. \"Nothing,\" she answers a little too quickly, a little too loudly, watching as Ryan\\'s eyebrows rise suspiciously. \"What are you thinking about?\" \"I was thinking about the choreography for Bop to the Top ,\" Ryan replies. \"I feel like we can spice it up a bit, but I\\'m not sure how.\" Mustering a forced smile, Sharpay lays her hand on Ryan\\'s affectionately, feeling grateful and slightly relieved from the distraction. \"It\\'s great, Ry. No changes needed.\" Ryan narrows his eyes at her in response, and Sharpay tries to keep her composure steady as she realizes that this was exactly the wrong thing to say. Sharpay always has notes, suggestions, something to change. Her being satisfied and genuinely encouraging must be a sign for Ryan that something is wrong. \"Are you okay? Something is off with you today,\" Ryan says, and Sharpay curses the day they were born. He knows her too well. Of course he can sense that something is up. She should tell him. She should trust him with this. With a deep sigh, she opens her mouth to tell him, but as she stares into Ryan\\'s blue eyes, she realizes she can\\'t do it. Not yet, at least. She needs to mull over this a bit more, figure out if it\\'s real or just a strange one-time occurrence, like she hopes it is. Although… maybe he can help \"How did you realize you were gay?\" Well, that\\'s one way to go about discussing this situation with her brother. It\\'s out of her mouth before she knows it, and she cowers a little as Ryan blinks in shock at the random question, before his eyes widen as he stares at her, realization dawning on him. \"Are you–? Do you think–?\" Maybe . \"No!\" Sharpay exclaims. \"I was just thinking the other day about how you never told me how you found out and I got curious.\" Ryan doesn\\'t seem to buy her reasoning, still glaring at her curiously, but he doesn\\'t probe any further. Instead, he purses his lips and shrugs. \"I guess I kind of always knew deep down.\" This makes Sharpay feel at least a little bit relieved. This is all new for her. She\\'s never even entertained the thought that this could happen until yesterday. It\\'s definitely not something that\\'s always been a part of her. It could still just be a giant misunderstanding. \"I guess I\\'ve always thought boys were cute and I was fascinated by them in a way I wasn\\'t about girls,\" Ryan continues. \"Some boys made me feel nervous and uneasy. They made my heart skip a beat and all that. And then I just gradually started to realize that I was crushing on them.\" Sharpay stays quiet as she feels her heart skip a beat, thinking back to many of the moments she\\'s shared with Gabriella before. Because what happened yesterday hasn\\'t been their first moment. She remembers those long stares, that moment of panic in the clothing store, the way her heart picks up speed quite often whenever Gabriella is near. This can\\'t be happening. Sharpay can\\'t deny that she\\'s always been fascinated by Gabriella ever since she\\'s arrived. She\\'s always chalked it up to feeling threatened by the change that Gabriella has brought about, but she can\\'t pretend anymore that is all of it. She definitely remembers that the first thing that sparked that fascination was not Gabriella\\'s suspicious behaviour. It was her eyes. That sparkle that she couldn\\'t shake, the same sparkle that was in her eyes yesterday. Oh god, maybe she really does have a crush on Gabriella Montez. She refuses to accept that. She refuses to give in. It\\'s only going to end in further demise, and it\\'s going to be much worse than what Gabriella\\'s audition caused. \"Are you sure you\\'re okay?\" Ryan snaps her out her thoughts, his eyes concerned as he studied her face. \"You look a little pale.\" \"I\\'m fine!\" she snaps, feeling slight guilt wash over her as Ryan blinks and frowns in response. With a sigh, she continues, a little softer, \"I just didn\\'t sleep well last night. Don\\'t worry about me.\" Ryan hums thoughtfully, still appearing concerned, but he doesn\\'t inquire any further as he returns to his food while Sharpay returns to staring at her apple as she contemplates what to do concerning the horrifying possibility that what happened was real. She really needs to get rid of Gabriella. She needs to get rid of these feelings. If there is one thing about East High that Gabriella is endlessly grateful for, it\\'s Troy\\'s secret rooftop. Today has been bad, as expected, so she has been looking forward to coming here all day, let the worries drop off her as she stares at the spectacular view. She still can\\'t make sense of what happened yesterday in Sharpay\\'s room. Were they just caught up in the moment? Or does it mean more? And if it does, why Sharpay Evans? Why the girl who had been nothing but terrible to her for weeks? Why the girl who she knew was trouble the minute their eyes locked that first day in homeroom? The more she thinks about it, though, the less outlandish it seems. Ever since she got here, she has had a curiosity about Sharpay. At every turn where Sharpay attempted to make Gabriella\\'s life miserable, Gabriella only became more intrigued, and wanted to be closer to her. Maybe it\\'s not just friendship that she wanted. Maybe it\\'s more. It\\'s such a ridiculous notion, though. They might be a match in some ways, but they\\'re wrong for each other for so many other reasons. She can\\'t possibly have real feelings for Sharpay Evans. There\\'s no way. Right? \"Is there something wrong?\" a male voice shakes Gabriella from her thoughts, and she averts her gaze from the mountaintops to land on Troy. Tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, she shakes her head. \"No, I\\'m just tired. It\\'s been a long day.\" She doesn\\'t think she can tell him about what is really bothering her. She\\'s been getting used to these deep conversations with him, where they lay their souls bare, but she can\\'t talk about this with him. How do you tell someone you like that you had a possibly romantic moment with someone else? Troy narrows his eyes slightly, before nodding slowly, both of their gazes drifting back to the view as Gabriella lets out a sigh. When did her life get so complicated? \"How is the musical going?\" Gabriella can\\'t help but crack a smile at the overly eager tone of his voice. Even despite his fear of actually participating, Troy\\'s interest in the musical and rehearsals remain strong. Oh, how she wishes he were there. It would make things a lot easier, especially now that she and Sharpay are back on bad terms again. \"We\\'re making progress. We\\'re starting to block scenes now, which is really fun.\" It would be a lot more fun if she didn\\'t have to deal with the Sharpay complication, though. Troy just smiles wistfully. \"I bet it is. And I bet you\\'re great.\" \"Well, if you\\'re supposed to believe Sharpay, I do have potential,\" Gabriella says, but she quickly regrets it when Troy looks back at her, his eyebrows raised curiously at the genuine tone of her voice. \"How is Sharpay doing anyway? Are you girls still getting along?\" No . But she wants to get along with her more than ever, Gabriella thinks as she bites her lip. \"She\\'s not the easiest person to be around,\" she answers – of course, it\\'s not the entire truth, but it\\'s close enough. \"But I think I may actually enjoy her company.\" She has definitely missed it today, with Sharpay – and by extension, a confused Ryan – ignoring her existence all day. There was no cruelty like Gabriella feared, but there was no pretending that nothing happened. Instead, there was just nothing. Just an endless rift between them that can\\'t be mended. She\\'s glad she doesn\\'t have to worry about such a strain when she\\'s with Troy, though. With Troy, everything is easy. As strange as it is, considering their different backgrounds and the secretive nature of their friendship, being with Troy feels safe. Stepping a little closer to him, she softly lays her head on his shoulder, a gesture of intimacy and gratefulness. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s anyone in this school whose company I enjoy more than yours, though.\" And, as much as she longs for Sharpay\\'s company, it really is true. Being here with him, she always feels freed from her worries. Troy\\'s head turns to look at her, his eyes a little hooded as he stares at her intensely, the blue in his eyes setting off a familiar feeling of butterflies. \"Likewise,\" he whispers, a little hoarsely, and Gabriella\\'s gaze trails down to his lips out of their own volition, and suddenly, she\\'s thrown back to that moment yesterday, that moment that she\\'s been trying to forget. With a gasp, she steps back from him, his eyes widening in horror and agony in response. She can\\'t dwell on the look in his eyes, though. All there is, is panic. Panic, panic, panic. She just felt the exact same spark she felt with Sharpay. And she has accepted long ago that she has feelings for Troy. If this is the same… That would mean her feelings for Sharpay are real, too. She has to get out of here. \"Sorry, I have to go,\" she quickly says as she grabs her stuff from the bench and almost trips as she hurries down the stairs. His footsteps follow her, but she can\\'t focus on anything but the pounding in her ears and the erratic breaths coming out of her mouth as she runs away. \"Gabriella!\" she hears him yell after her, alarmed and a little hurt, but she just keeps running until she\\'s in the ladies room, locked in a stall as she tries to catch her breath. It was real. Of course it was real. It has been real all along. All that intrigue she felt for Sharpay, the way she kept drawing Sharpay\\'s attention against knowing better, there was a reason for it. And, as she now realizes, she has been comparing Troy and Sharpay since the very start. Both of them have occupied her every thought since she came here, and she has thought it was for different reasons, but maybe they were the same reasons all along. She feels drawn to Troy because he makes her feel free and at ease, but she feels drawn to Sharpay because she challenges her, excites her. Both of them make her feel alive, but for different reasons. And now she\\'s here, opening up her heart to both of them, going to be hurt and going to cause pain to both of them. Why does she always get herself in situations where she\\'s going to get herself hurt, where she\\'s going to get too attached? Why couldn\\'t she just have done what she was supposed to do and join the scholastic decathlon without getting involved with either Troy or Sharpay? Why couldn\\'t she just go down the easy path? Why did she have to make things so difficult for herself? She\\'s going to get her heart broken. Possibly twice. She has to get out of this mess before it escalates even further. Maybe she should quit the musical. Maybe she should run away before it\\'s too late. A/N: Gabpay vs. Troyella is the love triangle we deserved, goodbye. Also, I felt it was really important that Sharpay talked to Ryan about this, as Ryan obviously would have experience with these kind of feelings. I hope I did that justice. As always, please leave kudos and/or comments to make me happy! :)'][Chapter 9] ['Sharpay has always had a temper. As long as she has been alive, she has been screaming, and as long as she could comprehend emotions, she has been stomping her foot and scowling and growing red with anger. It\\'s the only way she knows how to cope with adversity. She shouts and stomps until someone else solves her problem for her. This time around, however, there is no one to solve her problem. There\\'s no one who can make an expensive purchase or rearrange a song to accommodate it to Sharpay\\'s needs and desires. There\\'s no one who can make these feelings go away. Ever since the incident, Sharpay has been avoiding Gabriella, pretending that she doesn\\'t exist. Instead of going back to her snide remarks and attempts to intimidate her, she feels like it\\'s better to ignore her and hope that the problem will just go away. And it\\'s working. Maybe Gabriella is equally avoiding her, equally afraid to face her, because she hasn\\'t been nagging at her, just walking straight past her in the hallways, staying quiet during rehearsals, sitting with Taylor at lunch. It should have been a relief, to have a break from Gabriella and her aggravating eagerness, to be able to pretend that she isn\\'t falling apart, but she has to admit that she misses her. It\\'s become somewhat of a normal, to have Gabriella trailing beside her, trying to be her friend, and it feels quiet without her, as if something is missing. Sharpay hates quiet and she hates not having everything she wants and needs. So, in turn, Sharpay is compensating for the quiet. By yelling at every single person besides the one person she really wants to yell at. \"Why does it feel like I\\'m the only person who cares about this musical?!\" Sharpay is standing on stage, hand on her hip as her eyes slide over each and every single person – all except one – sitting in the auditorium with a vicious rage. Darbus had to be absent today – something about a meeting with Principal Matsui and Coach Bolton that couldn\\'t be rescheduled –, so as president of the drama club, Sharpay has taken over to lead the rehearsal and she has learned today that she is most definitely not cut out to be a teacher. She\\'s too angry, too frustrated to deal with everyone\\'s complete incompetence, and she can\\'t stand it that no one seems to be actually doing what she\\'s telling them to do. She doesn\\'t know if it\\'s Darbus\\'s absence or if everyone is just having a bad day, but every single person, from tech to band to actors, is continuously messing up and Sharpay is quickly starting to reach boiling point. As a teacher, as a leader, she should be accommodating and calmly correct people and teach them how to do their jobs properly. Instead, she just wants to throw some punches. Nothing is going the way she wanted. Nothing is going the way she planned. So, she does the one thing she knows how to do in these situations. She unleashes her temper. \"Well?!\" Every single one of her fellow students under her scrutiny are cowering, a look of genuine fear in their eyes, and while this normally would delight Sharpay, her desire for power is now trampled by her annoyance and her panic about her entire world crashing around her. \"Sharpay,\" Ryan speaks up, a slight tremble in his voice, \"I think we\\'re just all really tired. Why don\\'t we just call it a day?\" \"No,\" Sharpay barks immediately, scowling at her brother. \"We need to get our crap together or else this musical is going to be a disaster and I refuse to let that happen.\" Ryan opens his mouth again, but Sharpay raises her eyebrows at him menacingly, so he just sighs and sits back in his chair. Then, her eyes roam the room, only to land on the one person she\\'s been trying not to look at. She\\'s sitting next to Kelsi, slumping in her seat as she stares at the floor. She looks just as miserable as Sharpay feels and Sharpay genuinely doesn\\'t get it. She\\'s not the one may have who caught feelings for someone she thought she hated. She\\'s not the one whose life has completely been blown into a whirlwind because someone decided to audition and ruin all her plans. Sharpay can\\'t stand it, to see her like this. She wants Gabriella to speak up, to go against everything Sharpay wants. She wants a legitimate reason to hate Gabriella again, to realize that all of these feelings are silly and unnecessary, so she can look back at this in a few years and laugh. She wants things to go back to the way they were, before all of this happened. \"Gabriella,\" she says, and she watches as Gabriella blinks and looks up with shock and curiosity. She immediately knows it\\'s a bad idea, though, as a spark runs through her at looking into those beautiful eyes again. Ignoring the flutter in her stomach, Sharpay narrows her eyes at the girl, before smiling phonily. \"You always have suggestions to improve the musical, don\\'t you? Why don\\'t you tell us what to do?\" Gabriella blinks again, before looking around at the expectant faces and looking back to Sharpay. This is usually the point where that challenging glint appears in Gabriella\\'s eyes, the one that riles Sharpay up, but instead, her gaze remains empty of any kind of fire or spark. \"I don\\'t know,\" she says quietly, and Sharpay lets out a heavy breath and purses her lips in response. \"I think Ryan may be right. We\\'re all tired.\" \"Of course you don\\'t know,\" she scoffs. \"None of you do. None of you have any idea what to do. Idiots.\" Shaking her head, she walks off the stage and moves towards the back where Gabriella is sitting in menacing strides. However, she stops before she reaches Gabriella, bending down at the seat where Alan is sitting. \"You\\'re up,\" she says lowly as she stares into his frightened eyes. \"And I swear to god, if you stumble of your words one more time, I\\'m going to tear you up from limb to limb.\" \"Sharpay!\" Ryan exclaims warningly and Sharpay rolls her eyes as she stands up again and motions for Alan to go. As Alan scurries off to the stage, Sharpay turns back and raises her eyebrows at Gabriella one more time, challengingly, but Gabriella doesn\\'t respond, just remaining quiet. Sharpay hates the quiet. She hates this new normal where she and Gabriella ignore each other. She hates that she hates this new normal. She hates that she can\\'t solve this problem. When Gabriella thought about the inevitable end of the truce with Sharpay, she thought that things would go back to the way they were, with Sharpay being rude and Gabriella fighting the injustice she causes. Reality is much more brutal. Sharpay is still lashing out, but not at her specifically – rather, she lashes out at everything and everyone besides Gabriella. Meanwhile, Gabriella doesn\\'t know how to behave anymore, so she just remains quiet, miserable, out of place. Normally, when Gabriella is this distraught, she would go up to the rooftop and just enjoy the fresh air and spectacular view. However, when rehearsal finishes – it was particularly brutal one with Sharpay at the helm –, she has no idea where to go or what to do. Not only has she driven Sharpay away, but she has also driven Troy away. Ever since the mishap the other day, Gabriella hasn\\'t visited the rooftop anymore or even looked him in the eye, because she doesn\\'t know what to do, how to act, whether she can even explain to him what is going on inside of her head. Chaos, is the best word to describe it. How can she have feelings for two people, both so vastly different, and both so capable of breaking her heart? So, as she hurries out of the auditorium, quickly waving at Kelsi, she decides that the only thing to do is go home and wallow in self-pity alone. However, when she enters the hallway, she suddenly feels a strong hand on her arm and a spark shoot through her body. \"Gabriella.\" Looking at who has grabbed a hold of her, her eyes double in size as she suddenly feels nauseous. It\\'s Troy. And he looks as if he\\'s in agony. She gulps as he releases her arm from his grip and they wordlessly move away from the door as not to stand in anyone\\'s way or grab unwanted attention. For a moment, they just stare at each other in silence, so many unspoken questions and apologies between them. Gabriella bites her lip, feeling supremely awkward, before quietly saying, \"Hi.\" She rubs her hands along her arms in a gesture of anxiety, and Troy\\'s eyebrows furrow in worry. \"Are you cold?\" Gabriella almost wants to laugh at his genuine concern. He\\'s so kind, even after she left him with such confusion. Why can\\'t she just like him and only him? And why can\\'t she just open her heart to him? Because she always sets herself up for disappointment and pain, that\\'s why. Silently, she shakes her head in response to his question, and the awkward silence between them continues. Troy is the one who eventually breaks it, and to take the plunge. With a pained frown, he asks her, \"Did I misread the signs?\" Gabriella freezes. No , she wants to scream. None of this is his fault. All of this is due to her and her stupid feelings and her brain that\\'s unwilling to shut up. However, not a sound comes out. \"I mean, I thought our connection meant something more and I thought you felt the same and I\\'m so sorry if I misread that and freaked you out,\" he continues, and Gabriella blinks as she unfreezes, before shaking her head furiously. \"It\\'s not your fault,\" she says, firmly as she takes a step closer to him. \"It\\'s my fault. I\\'m scared.\" Troy\\'s eyebrows rise slightly, and Gabriella feels a blush come on as she moves her the gaze to the ground, her voice growing soft and nervous as she continues, \"I know it may not seem like it to you, but I\\'m not as brave as you seem to think I am. I\\'m just as terrified as you are of opening up myself.\" As she looks back up, she expects disappointment on his face, but instead, there\\'s a small, affectionate smile on his face. \"So it wasn\\'t just me?\" Feeling a blush come on, she shakes her head. \"No, not just you. I just don\\'t know how to deal with this.\" Furthermore, she doesn\\'t know how to deal with the fact that there\\'s two people she has to deal with. At least there\\'s only one person who may feel the same way. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she says, and Troy shakes his head as his grin only grows, the storm in his eyes disappearing and making way for that gorgeous light ocean blue. Softly, tentatively placing a hand on her shoulder, he squeezes. \"Don\\'t be sorry. You know that I know what it\\'s like to be scared. We\\'ll figure it out together.\" Together. She likes that. Just as she smiles and leans in a little closer to him – although she leaves enough space between them, still afraid to get too close –, the moment suddenly crashes down around them as a body pushes into hers from behind. Blinking, she turns around to see Sharpay, scowling at her. \"Oops!\" Sharpay exclaims sarcastically, before shooting Troy a fake smile. \"Hi, Bolton. What are you doing here?\" Troy\\'s hands fly up to his neck awkwardly as his eyes flick back and forth between Gabriella and Sharpay. \"I was just talking to Gabriella.\" Sharpay hums in response, before turning back to Gabriella and Gabriella bites her lip under Sharpay\\'s scrutinizing gaze. Why does she see a speck of hurt in Sharpay\\'s hazelnut eyes? How much of her and Troy\\'s conversation did she hear? And if that\\'s the reason why she looks so hurt, why would that hurt her? Does she–? No, that\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s just wishful thinking. And why is she even wishing that Sharpay returns her feelings in the first place? After a moment of intense eye contact, Sharpay shakes her head and scoffs. \"Well, toodles.\" Then, she turns to walk off, but before she can get far, Gabriella calls after her. \"Sharpay!\" Sharpay turns around, raising her eyebrows expectantly, and Gabriella tucks a curl behind her ear nervously. She doesn\\'t know what to say. She just wants Sharpay\\'s attention. So, she just says the first thing to come to mind. \"Do you still need tutoring?\" she asks, and she inwardly berates herself for asking such a stupid question. The answer is so clear. Sharpay seems to think it\\'s stupid as well, as she just stares at Gabriella incredulously for a moment. \"No, I\\'m good,\" she says curtly, before turning around and strutting off, Gabriella watching after her with a deep sigh. \"What was that about?\" Troy asks once Sharpay is out of sight. \"I thought you were getting along?\" Gabriella sighs. \"It\\'s complicated.\" Complicated and confusing and painful. She really needs to clear her head. Troy nods slowly, not asking any further questions, before a knowing smile grows on his face. \"Can I interest in you in a calming view from the rooftop?\" Gabriella giggles in response as she breaks out into a large beam. \"That\\'s exactly what I need.\" Troy winks at her. \"Race you?\" \"You\\'re on.\" And, as they run away together, laughing loudly, Gabriella feels a weight drop from her shoulders. She\\'s still scared and her mind is still a mess and she misses Sharpay, but at least she hasn\\'t lost Troy. At least there\\'s still someone out there for her. It feels strange to be having lunch with Taylor. It\\'s not like she hasn\\'t had lunch with Taylor since she befriended Sharpay, but those were different circumstances. When she divided her attention between Taylor and her friends from drama club, she was actually spending time with Taylor solely because she enjoyed her company. Now she\\'s also having lunch with Taylor because there\\'s no attention to divide anymore. \"So, what happened between you and Sharpay?\" Taylor asks casually as she picks a piece of tuna off her plate and Gabriella sighs as she moves her gaze away from the table upstairs to her friend. \"Nothing happened. Why do you think it did?\" Taylor lets out a laugh and shakes her head. \"I know you, Gabriella. You\\'ve been quiet for days now and you keep staring at her longingly.\" This makes Gabriella turn a dark shade of red as she almost chokes on her food. \"I\\'m not longing for her,\" she splutters. \"I\\'m not longing for anyone.\" Still, she can\\'t keep her gaze from flicking up for a second, which obviously doesn\\'t go unnoticed by Taylor, who just scoffs. \"You don\\'t think I haven\\'t noticed you looking up constantly? Or the fact that you\\'ve been staring at the back of her head during homeroom instead of paying attention?\" Gabriella continues blushing as she looks down at her plate, unsure of what to say. Of course Taylor is right. Of course she is longing. It\\'s just that no one knows to which extent she longs. It\\'s not a longing for a friendship or a truce, it\\'s a longing for something more. No one can ever know. \"Look, I won\\'t say I told you so, but I can\\'t say that I\\'m surprised that something happened between you two,\" Taylor continues. \"That girl is a snake. I still don\\'t get why you wanted to get along with her in the first place, after how horrible she has been to you.\" \"She\\'s not that bad,\" Gabriella mumbles, and Taylor scoffs again. \"Gabriella, I was there when you accidentally spilled your lunch on her. I was there when she spent a week throwing constant temper tantrums after you got a role in the musical. I\\'ve also seen the way she tramples all over her own brother and that composer girl. She\\'s rude and spoilt and selfish. How can you not see that?\" Gabriella shrugs. \"I just think she\\'s misunderstood. There\\'s more to her than just the bad. She\\'s pretty cool once you get to know her.\" \"If she\\'s so cool, then why aren\\'t you hanging with her anymore?\" Taylor retorts, and Gabriella bites her lip as she frowns, flashes of that afternoon when everything went wrong appearing before her eyes. Taylor would never understand. As Gabriella remains quiet, Taylor rolls her eyes. \"See? That\\'s what I mean. She\\'s a terrible person and she\\'s incapable of change.\" \"Taylor, will you just stop?!\" Gabriella exclaims, a little more loudly than intended, before gulping and looking back again. \"You don\\'t know her. Yeah, she\\'s a little snobby and a little rude, but she isn\\'t some demon like you\\'re making her out to be. She has actually helped me a lot.\" Taylor\\'s eyebrows furrow as she stares at Gabriella incredulously, a little suspiciously. \"Why do you keep defending her?\" Gabriella shrugs again. \"I like her.\" A lot more than Taylor would ever know. Taylor sighs as she shakes her head, before looking up at Sharpay, Ryan and Kelsi\\'s table. \"Well, she obviously doesn\\'t like you.\" A little more softly, more gently, she continues, \"I think it\\'s admirable that you want to see the good in people, but you can\\'t change people and turn them into someone they aren\\'t.\" Gabriella sighs as she looks up too. Maybe Taylor is right. Maybe she has been trying too hard to get Sharpay to like her. Of course she hasn\\'t wanted to change who Sharpay is, but somewhere along the line, maybe she has conjured up an image of Sharpay that isn\\'t true to reality. Maybe she has been so desperate to show that she\\'s different that she has made her believe that Sharpay is different, too. Maybe she has been trying too hard to be different. She has been going through such trials and tribulations the past couple of months and if it continues this way, it\\'s never going to pay off. Maybe she\\'s not as different as she thought. Maybe she has always been meant to be a loser, an outsider, whether she\\'s in the musical or in the scholastic decathlon. Maybe being in the musical isn\\'t as worth it as she once thought. She\\'s always going to be an outsider, a threat to Sharpay. She\\'s always going to have to fight. She\\'s tired of fighting. Fighting Sharpay, fighting Taylor, fighting her feelings, fighting for herself. She\\'s tired of all of this. She\\'s tired of being different. \"How\\'s the scholastic decathlon going?\" she asks, changing the subject, and Taylor suddenly lights up as she starts rambling about the comings and goings of the club, Gabriella nodding and smiling along, even though she\\'s not really listening. \"I know you\\'re busy with the musical, but you really should join!\" Taylor ends her ramble, and Gabriella bites her lip as she contemplates that. Deep down, she knows that the scholastic decathlon isn\\'t for her anymore, and that she wants to continue to be in the musical. But she can\\'t continue on like this anymore. So, with a forced smile, she says, \"Maybe.\" Maybe she should just accept her fate. Maybe she should just accept that nothing is ever going to change.'][Chapter 10] ['\"How did your math test go?\" Sharpay smiles triumphantly as she presents her test to Ryan. \"I got a B.\" Ryan\\'s eyes widen as a grin grows on his own face. \"That\\'s so great! So I guess all the tutoring has paid off?\" Sharpay\\'s smile immediately disappears off her face at that. Slamming the paper down on the lunch table, she pouts and rests her face in her hands as she takes a sip from her drink. Yes, the tutoring has definitely paid off, but she is not going to admit that. Because that means admitting that Gabriella has actually helped her, and that she has actually made her life a little better. She can\\'t admit that to anyone, and, most importantly, not to herself. Therefore, she ignores Ryan\\'s comment as she silently picks at her food, trying not to pay attention to the way Ryan and Kelsi are exchanging worried looks. They aren\\'t fools. They have noticed Sharpay\\'s bad moods and Gabriella\\'s absence. They know that something went down between the two of them, but they haven\\'t brought it up, obviously too afraid of the inevitable outburst it would cause. Thank god Sharpay hasn\\'t lost her way of intimidating others, because she really doesn\\'t think she can deal with their questions and interference. \"Maybe we can start rehearsing after school again,\" Kelsi suddenly pipes up, a little nervously, and Sharpay scoffs as she rolls her eyes. \"Yeah, well, lord knows we need some extra rehearsal.\" As it turns out, the bad rehearsal that Sharpay had led wasn\\'t a one-time occurrence. It\\'s like everyone has been off their game recently – except, obviously, Sharpay who has started to focus all her attention on her performance to avoid dealing with her problems –, and it\\'s becoming more likely that this entire thing is going to be a humiliation to the great institution that is the East High drama department. \"Maybe Gabriella could join the extra rehearsals again,\" Ryan responds, and Sharpay\\'s head perks up at that, her gaze meeting Ryan\\'s in a cold glare. His eyes are wide, and it\\'s obvious that the words came out before he realized it, but a fury still settles within her at even hearing that name. Before she can open her mouth to scream at him, though, Ryan quickly continues, \"You know, because she has such a large part, and she\\'s always needed a little extra help.\" His additional comment gives her just enough time to reconsider her tantrum, to think rationally. Now, of course, Sharpay has never been a rational person, always acting on her emotions and her impulses, but she knows Ryan. She knows that he\\'s suspicious, that he will demand to know the truth, if she throws a fit over something as simple as the mention of a name. And she can\\'t lie to him and keep this a secret, as good of an actress as she is and as much as she wants to keep this to herself. So, with a huff and a casual shrug, she says, \"She\\'ll be fine.\" And she will be. She has to be. She\\'ll learn how to survive with Sharpay, just as Sharpay will learn how to survive without her. Still, Sharpay\\'s heart aches, so she looks down to find the table Taylor usually sits at, only to find Gabriella not there with her. Feeling a pit form in her stomach, her eyes move towards the table where the jocks sit, her suspicions confirmed as she doesn\\'t find Troy Bolton amongst his friends. Sharpay feels a heaviness settle in her chest as she remembers the conversation she had walked in on a few days ago. She still doesn\\'t know why and how those two are hanging out, but one thing is clear – Gabriella likes Troy. And Troy likes her back. And Sharpay is left with memories and dreams that will lead to nowhere. For the first time in her life, she truly feels like she\\'s losing. However, maybe she\\'s winning after all. Maybe she\\'s dodging a bullet before it\\'s too late and maybe she can keep this to herself and not be subjected to humiliation. Maybe it\\'s for the best. With a shake of her head, she turns back to her food. Gabriella will be fine without her. And Sharpay will learn be fine without Gabriella too. \"Are you sure your friends won\\'t miss you?\" Lunch has become Gabriella\\'s least favourite part of the day over the past few days, as she spends it either missing Sharpay and her other friends from the musical or being annoyed with Taylor and her harsh judgment. So, when Troy invited her up to the rooftop to have lunch with her there today, she felt quite delighted. Watching as he tears into a sandwich, she even feels at ease for the first time in a while. \"Nah,\" he says, mouth full, and he shakes his head. \"They\\'ll survive without me.\" He looks down at his sandwich for a moment, before locking his eyes with Gabriella\\'s again, blushing as a hand comes up to rub his neck. \"I prefer spending time with a gorgeous girl like you anyway.\" Gabriella feels herself flush in response. \"Troy…\" Troy frowns, a little guilty. \"Sorry, I\\'m pushing it.\" He isn\\'t pushing it, of course – it\\'s just an innocent compliment, a nice compliment, a sign of his affection for her –, but she still doesn\\'t know how to deal with his flirting now that it\\'s become real and their feelings are out in the open. Well, at least, partially. Troy still doesn\\'t know that he isn\\'t the only person she has feelings for. And she feels guilty about that, about potentially leading him on, so she still tries to push him away as much as she can. And while he\\'s understanding and apologetic whenever she gets uncomfortable, it is a little weird to remain just friends with him even though they know how they feel about one another. God, why does she have to make things so complicated for herself? \"It\\'s okay,\" she whispers as she tucks a hair behind her ear, shooting him a small smile, which he returns as he takes another bite of his sandwich, leaving a bit of sauce in the corner of his lip. Her smile widening, she points to the same spot on her own face. \"You\\'ve got something there.\" Troy blushes in embarrassment as he hurries to wipe at his lips. \"Gone?\" Gabriella shakes her head, giggling as Troy grows redder as he continues wiping furiously at his lips, and keeps just missing the spot. Shaking her head with playful aggravation, she leans forward to wipe away the sauce from his lips. As the tip of her finger flutters against his lips, she feels a small spark run through her, and as she realizes how close their faces away, she quickly pulls away, suddenly feeling awkward. \"As good as new,\" she says a little anxiously, but Troy doesn\\'t seem to share her nerves, just smiling at her gratefully and continuing to eat as if nothing happened, as if they weren\\'t so close just now. He\\'s doing this to make her feel at ease and she can\\'t be more grateful. However, she can see the hopeful spark hidden in his eyes, and the guilt seeps in again. \"Are you really okay with taking things slow, just staying friends for now?\" she asks, averting her gaze, before Troy places a finger under her chin and lifts her head back up to look him in the eyes. His own eyes are warm with honesty as he says, \"Of course. I know all about fear, remember? I\\'m not going to push you into things you don\\'t want, that\\'s not cool.\" A mischievous twinkle appearing in his eyes, he winks at her. \"I\\'m fine as long as I get to spend time with you.\" Gabriella softly pulls his hand away from her chin and rolls her eyes playfully. \"Charmer.\" Then, she smiles, a little bashfully. \"But the feeling is likewise.\" And it\\'s the truth. She\\'s glad she can remain in his presence, be with him, while she takes her time to figure out what her heart wants. She hates that she can\\'t be in Sharpay\\'s presence, too, but this is good enough. It\\'s good enough to have him, at least. Sharpay is off her game. Up until now, she\\'s been able to proudly say that she is the only one who can hold herself together in musical rehearsals. She\\'s not fumbling over lines, or singing off-key, or unable to follow stage directions, unlike every single one of her peers. However, it seems that she\\'s the one who can\\'t hold it together today. Of course, she knew this moment would inevitably come, where the facade would break, but somewhere deep inside her, she still had hope that she would be able to cope with all of this, that she would retain her integrity and her grace and her perfectionism. Alas, it was not meant to be. Because inevitably, she would have to face the music – pun unintended –, and work with Gabriella again. They have so many scenes together, and it\\'s impossible to avoid her forever, but she just wishes she could. Because right now, staring into Gabriella\\'s – Mary\\'s – eyes as she talks about how in love Minnie is with Arnold, Sharpay feels as if she\\'s going to shatter into a million tiny pieces at any second. And if there\\'s one thing she hates, it\\'s feeling weak. \"And scene!\" Ms. Darbus calls, just as Mary is about to tell Minnie to be careful. Both girls turn to Ms. Darbus, who looks furious as she has her hands placed on her hips, and Sharpay feels a burning shame rage through her. She doesn\\'t like it when she doesn\\'t get Ms. Darbus\\'s approval. It only occurs rarely, but it always makes her feel terrible and inadequate. It makes her feel scared. And she\\'s been feeling scared enough lately. \"What happened? You two used to nail this scene and now it\\'s abhorrent,\" Ms. Darbus barks as she stands in front of them, and Sharpay grimaces as she feels Gabriella\\'s eyes on her, both of them knowing exactly what caused them to stop working well together. It\\'s funny, though, because when they shamelessly hated each other – or at least, when Sharpay hated Gabriella –, they used to work together great. But now that they\\'ve had a taste of what it could be like if they would actually get along and it all fell apart, they\\'re terrible. \"Miss Montez, you have potential, but you can\\'t just slack off. You have to give it your all,\" Ms. Darbus continues, turning to Gabriella and Sharpay nods vigorously as she watches Gabriella flush with embarrassment. Ms. Darbus is right. Gabriella has to give it her all. She can\\'t divide her attention with other things. It\\'s unfair to the musical and the other people who work on it. It\\'s also unfair to Sharpay that she gives her attention and then turns around and gives it to Troy as well. But that\\'s not relevant right now. \"And Miss Evans,\" Ms. Darbus says, her voice booming and filled with disappointment as she turns to Sharpay, who pouts in response. \"I\\'ve seen what you can do and this is not it. I expect better from you.\" She expects better from herself too. Scowling as she feels everyone\\'s eyes on her, she feels humiliated and small, but she holds her head high as she nods. Looking back and forth between the two girls, Ms. Darbus sighs. \"I don\\'t know and I don\\'t care what happened between you two personally, but you need to act like professionals.\" Sharpay\\'s gaze flickers to Gabriella, meeting her eyes briefly, before she meets Ms. Darbus\\'s gaze again. \"Yes, Ms. Darbus.\" With a firm nod, Ms. Darbus moves away again, draping her colourful scarf over her shoulder. \"From the top!\" With a sigh, Sharpay turns back to Gabriella and launches back into character, trying so desperately to suppress the agonizing pain sitting in her chest. Of course, she can\\'t wish her heartache away, but she\\'s nothing if not a good actress, so she regains her composure and moves the walls back up. She\\'s going to fake it until she makes it. Gabriella is getting more and more convinced that she may have made a mistake in auditioning for the musical. She\\'s not living up to the potential that Ms. Darbus saw in her, and her difficulties with Sharpay are taking the fun out of it as well. So, when rehearsal is done for the day, she gets out as quickly as she can. Maybe she can go to the rooftop, get her mind off things. And if not, she\\'ll just go home. However, when she walks past the gym, and hears the sound of a basketball bouncing, she can\\'t help but get a little curious as she peers inside. The sight that she finds makes her smile. It\\'s Troy, shooting free throws by himself. Although he has said many times that he\\'s been experiencing a lot of pressure due to the sport, he looks quite peaceful right now. She bites her lip and walks into the gym as Troy turns around to see her watching him and shoots her a mischievous smile. \"So, this is your stage, huh?\" she says jokingly, and Troy laughs as he shakes his head and hands her the ball. \"Nah, it\\'s just the gym.\" Tentatively, Gabriella grabs the ball from his hands and throws it, smiling triumphantly as it swishes through the basket perfectly. \"Are you good at everything?\" he asks, faking annoyance. She picks up the ball, before shrugging as she turns back to him. \"Well, I once scored 41 points in the league championship game.\" She can barely hold in her laughter as Troy\\'s eyes widen, impressed, before she adds mischievously, \"I also invented the space shuttle and microwave popcorn.\" His impressed expression is immediately wiped from his face as he rolls his eyes and grabs the ball from her hands. \"Funny.\" He throws the ball into the net again and Gabriella watches him with a knowing smile, which Troy obviously notices, since he turns to her and quirks an eyebrow. \"What?\" \"You seem very peaceful when you\\'re playing,\" she says, continuing to smile as Troy rubs his neck bashfully. \"It\\'s not at all like how I imagined you as a basketball player.\" \"Well, it\\'s great when I get to do it on my own terms,\" he admits. \"I just don\\'t like the pressure of being captain. I want to do it because I like it, not because other people do.\" Gabriella nods, as she thinks back to where she was at the beginning of the semester, wanting to be more than what other people expected of her. It seems like forever ago, when she had that pressure on her shoulders. Now, she has a different kind of pressure, but it feels strange to think that she once didn\\'t know that feeling of freedom that being in the musical and breaking the mold gives her. \"That\\'s why I admire you,\" Troy continues, as if he\\'s reading her mind. \"Because you auditioned and dealt with all the consequences, because you wanted to do it.\" Gabriella merely blushes in response, and Troy smiles at her before throwing the basketball into the net again. His words remain on the back of her mind as she continues to watch his practice. Suddenly, she\\'s reminded again that she\\'s not only doing this for herself, but also to help others who have trouble sticking up for themselves. She has come so far. Maybe she shouldn\\'t give up just yet. Maybe she should give it a little more time. Suddenly, Gabriella notices that Troy\\'s demeanour is changing, his hand going up to his neck to scratch in a nervous gesture as he blushes bashful. Gabriella raises her eyebrows at his sudden change in demeanour, before he smiles at her nervously. \"Hey, my parents are out of town this weekend. Do you want to come over to watch a movie? Hang out outside of school?\" Gabriella\\'s eyes widen as her heart skips a beat. Hanging out alone at Troy\\'s house? For some reason, it seems like a big step, especially considering how nervous Troy looks. However, it also seems like fun. And she needs fun. So, she shrugs in what she hopes is a casual fashion and answers, \"Sure.\" Troy grins in response. \"Great.\" And then, on a complete whim, she grabs the basketball from his hands and starts running around with it, giggles spilling from her mouth. \"Hey! That\\'s travelling! No, that\\'s bad travelling!\" Suddenly, she feels his arms around her waist and she lets out a little squeal as he picks her up from the ground and spins around. And, as she realizes she doesn\\'t feel the worries about Sharpay and the musical consuming her anymore, she feels a warmth run through her. Yes, fun is exactly what she needs. As Gabriella sits on the couch in the Bolton house, fun is not the word on her mind anymore. Instead, it\\'s fear. And anxiety. The film has just started – they picked on a thriller that is not too scary – and Gabriella feels incredibly awkward as she\\'s sitting as far away from Troy as possible. She hadn\\'t realized that this could definitely count as a date, and she\\'s definitely not ready for that yet. Not as long as she still has these feelings for Sharpay, and not as long as she still has fear of emotional proximity anyway. Troy doesn\\'t seem to mind, though, engrossed in the movie as he pops popcorn in his mouth. However, when he feels Gabriella\\'s eyes on his, he turns to her and smiles. Handing out the bowl to her, he offers, \"Popcorn?\" Smiling awkwardly, Gabriella grabs a handful from the bowl, trying to focus her attention on what is happening on the screen as well. However, she can\\'t do it. She keeps feeling on edge due to his presence and she can\\'t help but flick her gaze to him at what feels like a rate of every few seconds. As his eyes flick towards hers as well and their eyes meet, she blushes. Her blush deepens when the couch shifts as he scoots closer to her, tentatively putting an arm around the back of the couch. Looking back up, she sees that he\\'s staring at her still, and a slow grin grows on his face when their eyes meet. Suddenly, she\\'s transported to a time when she was just as close with Sharpay, and the fear she felt then. It encompasses her now too, but she fights through the urge to get up and leave, knowing how much it could potentially ruin. She knows she\\'s leading him on, not knowing yet what she wants, but she doesn\\'t want things to be ruined again. She doesn\\'t want things to end up the way they have with Sharpay. So, she just smiles back, a little hesitantly and a little fearfully. \"Is this okay?\" he mumbles, his voice a little husky, and Gabriella can\\'t help but feel a warmth spread through her. It\\'s so simple, his question of consent, but it makes her feel a lot more comfortable than she would otherwise. She nods, slowly, but then his eyes flick to her lips and she feels her heart constrict as her eyes widen in response. Troy seems to sense her fear and her hesitance, for he quickly averts his gaze and returns his attention the movie, and Gabriella lets out a sigh of relief as she turns back to the screen, too. They stay like that for a while, close but not too close, and Gabriella feels content. For the first time, she doesn\\'t feel as scared of this proximity anymore. So, when he places his arm around her shoulder, she doesn\\'t pull away. Instead, she snuggles closer to him, feeling warm and content as she meets his eyes and they share a smile. It feels good to let down her guard and let him in. It feels like the correct decision, the right thing to do. Now that she is becoming so much closer to Troy, Gabriella feels the sunshine in her life slowly return. Of course, she still worries about the musical, and she still hurts over Sharpay, but it doesn\\'t feel as bad anymore. She feels happy with him. She feels happy being on the rooftop with him for what feels like hours after school, and she feels happy right now as they walk through the vacated hallways to leave school, his arm slung casually over her shoulder. However, the happiness quickly crashes as she suddenly sees another figure in the corridor, an unmistakable flash of pink. And when her eyes meet a pair of cold, hazelnut eyes, she feels an eerie chill run through her as those eyes flash with hurt. She should just go on with her life and ignore Sharpay, like she\\'s been doing a lot lately, but something in her wants to talk to Sharpay right now. While she\\'s in Troy\\'s arms. \"Hey, Sharpay.\" They hesitantly come to a stop in front of each other and Sharpay raises her eyebrows as Gabriella bites her lip, unsure what to say, unsure of what she wants to say. The only thing she knows is that she wants Sharpay to know that her feelings aren\\'t any less real, even with this blossoming relationship with Troy. But she can\\'t say that. It would freak both Sharpay and Troy out, and it would drive them away. \"What are you doing at school so late?\" she asks instead, and Sharpay shrugs casually in response as she lifts her hand to inspect her nails. \"I was just rehearsing by myself, so this show doesn\\'t turn into a trainwreck,\" she answers, and Gabriella doesn\\'t miss the venom in her tone, telling her that she should rehearse more as well, but she can\\'t help but smile as she remembers that time she first saw Sharpay\\'s private rehearsals. They were rivals back then, but somehow, things were much easier. \"And what were you two lovebirds doing here?\" Sharpay continues, emphasizing the word lovebirds with a bitter resentment and another emotion that makes surprises Gabriella and makes her heart pound. Is Sharpay… jealous? No, that can\\'t be. It shouldn\\'t be. It would make things more difficult than they already are. \"We\\'re not lovebirds,\" Troy answers quickly, looking at Gabriella for confirmation, and Gabriella smiles gratefully in response. She may be happy to be opening herself up to him, but they\\'re still moving slowly. Sharpay doesn\\'t seem to believe them, though, rolling her eyes and scoffing. Gabriella quickly adds, \"We were just on the r– in the gym! He\\'s helping with free throws!\" Troy quickly nods in response, and Sharpay narrows her eyes at Gabriella for a second, before nodding. Then, she quickly checks her bedazzled watch and shoots them another phony smile. \"Well, it\\'s late, I have to be on my way,\" she says, before waving. \"Nice talking to you! Toodles!\" Then, she pushes Troy and Gabriella apart to move between them and storms off, both of them watching after her. When their eyes meet again, Gabriella shrugs, hoping that Troy won\\'t inquire about her relationship with Sharpay. Thankfully, he doesn\\'t, but she doesn\\'t feel as happy anymore as they start walking down the corridor again. She can\\'t shake the hurt in Sharpay\\'s eyes when she saw them. She thought that being with Troy would make her happy, but it turns out that it only makes things worse between her and Sharpay. She won\\'t ever truly be happy, not as long as Sharpay is on her mind. A/N: Alright, I know it seems like Gabriella is choosing Troy, but I promise this is still a Gabpay fic… Anyways, as always, please leave kudos and/or comments, they make me so happy!'][Chapter 11] ['While the musical has caused Gabriella a lot of pain and misery, it has also given her so many beautiful things that she could have never imagined. It has given her freedom, a sense of purpose, a confidence boost and so much more. But most of all, it has given her new friends that she wouldn\\'t trade for the world. Of course, two of her new friends aren\\'t really talking to her right now – Gabriella\\'s issues might regard Sharpay, but Ryan seems afraid to speak to her as well –, but she still has Kelsi. Talented, kind Kelsi. When she thinks of Kelsi and how far they\\'ve both come since they met – both in finding themselves and gaining the confidence to stand for what they believe in –, she feels so incredibly proud. It\\'s also a reminder that she\\'s not doing this for naught. There\\'s a purpose bigger than herself in remaining in the musical – being brave for Troy, standing up for Kelsi, learning to put herself out there – and it makes her feel all the more guilty about the fact that she\\'s began to seriously consider quitting. It\\'s been a thought in the back of her mind for a while, ever since it happened, but now that she\\'s begun to realize that the only way to get over this is to cut Sharpay out of her life completely, it\\'s been starting to become a more likely and reasonable solution to her problems. She doesn\\'t think she will go through with it as long as the stakes are so high, but she also doesn\\'t think she can handle those stakes anymore. She really hates that she would have to let Kelsi down, though, because Kelsi has been such a great friend to her and it makes her happy to see Kelsi so excited and full of life, so different from the terrified girl she met a few months ago. Sitting besides Kelsi at the piano as they rehearse together, Gabriella can\\'t stop imagining how disappointed Kelsi would be if she would quit. She can\\'t shake the idea anymore, though. She can\\'t shake the urge to run away from it all and never look back. \"You know, we miss you at lunch,\" Kelsi says as she softly plays a melody on the piano and Gabriella closes her eyes briefly with pain. \"I miss you guys, too,\" she answers honestly, looking down at her lap and fiddling with her hands. \"I\\'m pretty sure you\\'re the only who misses me, though.\" Kelsi smiles sadly. \"Ryan misses you, too. He\\'s just… a little scared of his sister.\" Gabriella lets out a hollow laugh. \"Yeah, I figured.\" Then, she purses her lips as a thought suddenly springs to mind. Sharpay has been more ruthless and cold than ever lately and it\\'s obvious that her anger hasn\\'t been solely directed at Gabriella, but also on other drama club members, probably including Kelsi and Ryan. From what Gabriella has gathered of the dynamic between the twins, Ryan doesn\\'t seem that bothered by Sharpay\\'s antics in general, but if even he is scared… That means that Kelsi might be in trouble too. Guilt seeps in again. By quitting the show, even by not hanging out with Kelsi whenever Sharpay is near anymore, she might be leaving Kelsi to the wolves. Of course, she knows rationally that it\\'s not her responsibility to care for Kelsi, but it still makes her feel incredibly uncomfortable. It is Gabriella\\'s fault that Sharpay is like this. It is Gabriella\\'s fault that she got carried away and freaked Sharpay out. It is Gabriella\\'s fault that this is happening. \"Hey, is Sharpay being awful to you?\" she asks when they\\'re sitting in the music room to rehearse – and spend some time together –, and she feels her stomach drop when Kelsi\\'s gentle smile falls into a deep frown as she shrugs casually. \"It could be worse. I think she\\'s just in a bad mood generally, but she\\'s not specifically aiming any bad behaviour at me.\" Gabriella nods slowly, but it doesn\\'t set her mind at ease. Sharpay\\'s behaviour aimed at Kelsi never has seemed intentional, but that doesn\\'t make it any less cruel. \"It\\'s all my fault,\" she sighs desperately and Kelsi immediately stops playing as she moves her gaze from the sheet music to Gabriella. \"I\\'m sure it isn\\'t,\" she says, encouragingly, but Gabriella can hear it in her voice that Kelsi isn\\'t convinced. Kelsi isn\\'t a fool. Anyone could see that this behaviour is directly caused by Gabriella, even if they don\\'t know the details of what happened between them. So, she merely sends Kelsi a pointed look. \"It is.\" Kelsi smiles pitifully in response, before her face morphs into a more serious, thoughtful expression as she stares at Gabriella for a moment. Tentatively, then, she asks, \"What happened between you two anyway?\" Gabriella freezes. She should have expected this question, especially after she didn\\'t try to hide that she knew that Sharpay\\'s behaviour was because of her. But she has no answer. At least, she has no answer that would be satisfactory, that wouldn\\'t reveal too much, that wouldn\\'t be too humiliating. She\\'s not sure Kelsi would be understanding, with her own tumultuous past with Sharpay. She is sure, however, that Kelsi isn\\'t the judgmental kind and that she wouldn\\'t be too harsh on her or go around and tell Sharpay that Gabriella thinks she might have feelings for her. That makes it a little tempting to just pour out her heart to Kelsi, but it\\'s still too daunting. As soon as it\\'s out there, it\\'s out there, and that terrifies Gabriella. The truth is still terrifying and even though Gabriella has come to terms with it, she still wants to do nothing more than to run away, to pretend none of this ever happened. That\\'s impossible, though, but she can still keep it to herself. So, she just shakes her head and says, \"It doesn\\'t matter.\" Looking at Kelsi, she can see the curiosity in her eyes, but Kelsi thankfully doesn\\'t press any further. Gabriella bites her lip and sighs as she continues, \"All I know that it\\'s so complicated that I sometimes feel like it may actually be better if I quit.\" This makes Kelsi\\'s eyes widen in horror. \"But you\\'re not seriously considering quitting, right?\" The tone of Kelsi\\'s voice is desperate and it makes Gabriella feel guilty as she begrudgingly admits, \"Maybe.\" Kelsi shakes her head furiously as she takes Gabriella\\'s hands in hers. \"Please don\\'t. Don\\'t let her get under your skin and win.\" As Gabriella quirks an eyebrow in response – if anyone has let Sharpay get under their skin in the past, it\\'s Kelsi –, Kelsi rolls her eyes with a small smile. \"I know, that\\'s a bit hypocrite of me to say that, but it\\'s true. You helped me stand my ground against her, and you need to do that as well.\" Easier said than done , Gabriella thinks. Her problem isn\\'t that she can\\'t stand her ground, it\\'s that she can\\'t stand to be around Sharpay after what happened. Her problem is not due to Sharpay\\'s bad behaviour, but rather due to her own emotions. \"I\\'m not actually going to quit,\" she assures Kelsi. \"It may be hard right now, but I\\'m not going to give up.\" On the musical, at least. Sharpay and whatever relationship they might have and could have may be a different case entirely. Kelsi smiles relieved in response, before the thoughtful expression returns. \"You know, if you ever need any help with her, or just to talk…\" Gabriella giggles, not oblivious to Kelsi\\'s curiosity, and shakes her head. \"This is something I have to figure out by myself, but thanks for offering.\" Kelsi smiles. \"I\\'m here for you if you need me, okay?\" Gabriella returns the smile, feeling warm and content and grateful. \"I know. Thank you. And likewise.\" And that\\'s the end of that, for Kelsi nods at her, before returning back to the piano. \"Well, should we take it from the top?\" As they focus their attention on the music again, Gabriella can\\'t help but notice the glances Kelsi keeps shooting her and she tries to ignore them. She understand Kelsi\\'s curiosity, and she\\'s grateful for her extended support, but she meant what she said. This is her problem, her issue to figure out. Private rehearsals keep Sharpay\\'s mind off things. It makes her feel a little calmer, a little more at ease, so she\\'s grateful when she finds a note from Ryan in her locker asking her to come to the auditorium to rehearse with him. She thinks she truly may have the best brother in the world. However, that thought quickly vanishes when she arrives in the auditorium, and doesn\\'t find Ryan there. Instead, she\\'s met with the sight of Gabriella, looking just as confused and freaked out as she is. \"What are you doing here?!\" Sharpay snaps. \"Ryan and I need the space to rehearse.\" Gabriella\\'s eyebrows furrow in confusion as she peers down at a piece of paper in her hand. \"Kelsi actually asked to meet me here for rehearsal too.\" Their eyes lock again, a flutter running through Sharpay\\'s stomach, before realization dawns on both of them. Ryan is not the best brother in the world – instead, he is quite possibly the worst one. Sharpay feels her face grow a fiery shade of red with rage as she stomps her foot in place. She should have known. After all, Ryan has learned to scheme directly from her. And she has always known that Kelsi isn\\'t as innocent and helpless as she seems. Those two little assholes set her and Gabriella up. Sharpay is furious. Whatever is going between her and Gabriella is none of their concern. If she doesn\\'t want to be near Gabriella, she will not be near Gabriella. She\\'s not going to let anyone else force her to make up and pretend that everything is a-okay. She can\\'t do that, because it would be a lie, and while she\\'s lived enough lies in her life, this is one that she doesn\\'t want to live. \"This is bullshit,\" she seethes. \"I\\'m out of here.\" Gabriella, who has been frozen in place since their mutual realization dawned, blinks, before nodding, too. \"Yeah, I should go.\" However, before either can move, however, two pairs of footsteps enter the auditorium. \"You two are not going anywhere.\" There\\'s the assholes. Of course they would be there to oversee their plan, to witness this reconciliation that they have planned. Well, it won\\'t happen. She won\\'t give in. \"What the hell?! Why did you bring us here?!\" she screeches. as she crosses her arms over her chest, scowling at Ryan. He seems unaffected, however, coming towards her in determined strides as Kelsi trails behind him, looking a little apprehensive and a little scared. She should be scared, alright. Sharpay is going to kill her and Ryan when all of this is over. As Ryan and Kelsi stop in front of them, the former raises his eyebrows challengingly as he looks back and forth between Sharpay and Gabriella. \"You two obviously seem to have some issues and you need to solve it, because frankly, Kelsi and I are getting tired of it. And so is the rest of the drama club.\" \"Did you pass around a survey?\" Sharpay retorts sarcastically, before pouting and rolling her eyes as Ryan sends her a warning glare. Then, his face softens a little. \"I know you have your pride, Shar, and I know you\\'re scared, Gabriella, but this is affecting the musical. You need to get over yourselves and fix whatever is going on.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Sharpay sees Gabriella sneak a contemplative yet panicked look at her, but she keeps staring straight ahead, glaring into Ryan\\'s eyes. This isn\\'t a matter of pride. This is a matter of possible heartbreak and probable humiliation. This is a matter of not being able to deal with the reality that she might have feelings for Gabriella Montez. \"This is none of your business, Ryan,\" she hisses. \"Whatever is going on between me and Gabriella is between me and her. And I refuse to be forced by you to do something that I frankly don\\'t want to do.\" Ryan rolls his eyes, before his face softens even more. He\\'s smiling at her sympathetically, a little pained, which only further enrages her. \"But don\\'t you miss each other?\" Of course Ryan is trying to play on her emotions, but the worst part is that it might actually be working. Her heart aches sneaks a little glance at Gabriella, who is now looking at the ground forlornly. Of course she misses Gabriella. That\\'s the entire reason why they\\'re in this mess. \"You can\\'t miss someone when you barely know each other,\" she says coldly, trying to ignore the way Gabriella\\'s close in hurt and how that makes her own heart clench. Ryan sighs in exasperation. \"Come on, Sharpay, you know that\\'s not true.\" Then, he turns to Gabriella and narrows his eyes on her thoughtfully. \"I\\'m sorry. I had to do this. Kelsi told me what you told her. About the show.\" Gabriella\\'s eyes widen in horror, before she averts her gaze, tears in her eyes. Kelsi sees it, too, and she frowns with apparent guilt. A little panicked, she rambles, \"I\\'m sorry, Gabriella, I just wanted to fix this. I understand it if you hate me.\" However, Gabriella shakes her head and smiles through her tears. \"No, it\\'s fine, I understand. I\\'m just a little… shocked.\" A pit forms in Sharpay\\'s stomach as she watches Gabriella so distraught and she suddenly feels a strange urge to defend her against whatever Kelsi did. However, there\\'s also a question burning on her mind. \"What did you tell Kelsi?\" Gabriella bites her lip as she continues staring at the ground. \"I\\'ve thought about quitting the show.\" Now it\\'s Sharpay\\'s turn to freeze in horror. If this had happened a couple of months ago, Sharpay would have been exhilarated. It would be the solution to all of her problems, a way for things to get back to normal. She should feel that way now too. Gabriella was ahead of her – this would fix everything. Yet she doesn\\'t want Gabriella to leave. As freaked out as she is by all of this, she doesn\\'t want to completely drive her away. \"Because of me?\" she asks, her voice small and trembling, and she feels her knees wobble beneath her as Gabriella bites her lip and nods slowly. Hating Gabriella is easier than loving her, but it turns out that knowing that Gabriella hates her is one of the worst and most painful feelings she has ever experienced. Feeling herself begin to hyperventilate and the world start to spin, she shakes her head furiously. \"I can\\'t do this.\" She can\\'t be here anymore. It\\'s too painful. So, she runs. Things between her and Gabriella have been irrevocably ruined now. And there is no one to talk to about it, there is no one who would understand. She needs to gather her thoughts. She needs to be alone. Alone, alone, alone. Alone is all she\\'ll ever be. As soon as Sharpay runs out, there\\'s only one thing Gabriella can do. Follow her. She has seen the pain in Sharpay\\'s eyes, the tremble in her voice, and she is befuddled. All this time, she thought that Sharpay hated her because of what happened, but as it turns out, Sharpay is just freaked out. Just like her. And now she probably thinks that Gabriella hates her, while it\\'s actually quite the opposite. As if their mess could get any bigger. However, while Ryan and Kelsi grossly overstepped and should have never put them on the spot like that, she can\\'t blame them. As misguided as they were, they were trying to help, and they did . They convinced Gabriella that her relationship with Sharpay isn\\'t entirely broken and it\\'s worth fighting for after all. So, as Ryan tries to call after Sharpay, Gabriella shakes her head and places a hand on his shoulder to stop him. \"I\\'ll go after her.\" The apprehensive look in Ryan\\'s eyes tells her it\\'s not going to be easy, but she has to do this. Sharpay has to know that she doesn\\'t hate her. So, without waiting for his reply, she runs out of the theatre, in the direction that Sharpay came from. She almost smiles when she finds her sitting just outside the theatre, just like that time when they finally made peace. Hopefully, they can make peace now, too. \"Hi,\" she says carefully as she stops right in front of Sharpay and Sharpay looks up at her with angry yet pained eyes. \"What are you doing here?\" she asks, just like before, and Gabriella offers her a small smile. \"I just wanted to see if you\\'re okay,\" she responds and Sharpay lets out a hollow laugh through her tears as she raises her eyebrows. \"You want to see if I am okay?\" Sharpay says incredulously. \"You\\'re the one who was put on the spot to tell me something that you obviously didn\\'t want me to know.\" That\\'s true, Gabriella reckons, and maybe she should be more upset at Ryan and Kelsi, but right now, she can\\'t worry about that. Not when Sharpay is sitting there like a sad lump of misery. Not when she thinks Gabriella hates her. \"Besides,\" Sharpay continues, fiddling with her hand in her lap. \"Don\\'t you hate me?\" Gabriella shakes her head as she tentatively sits down beside her, making sure there\\'s enough space between them not to freak out Sharpay too much. \"I don\\'t hate you,\" she says softly, and Sharpay looks at her and scoffs disbelievingly. \"I\\'ve made your life miserable for the past few months. I nearly drove you to quit the show. I completely freaked you out that day at my house. And you\\'re trying to tell me that you don\\'t hate me?\" \"I thought I freaked you out that day!\" Of course, Sharpay did freak her out, but it\\'s not in the way that Sharpay seems to think. That moment that they shared, she thought that it was one-sided on her part, that it was her fault, but now it seems that it may been mutual. That, of course, opens a possibility that Gabriella has pushed to the back of her mind, as she tries to suppress the thrill that runs through her body at that thought. It wouldn\\'t ever work out. She has Troy, who is right and safe for her, and the fact that she and Sharpay almost ruined themselves over one small moment should be enough evidence that they\\'re not right for each other. That doesn\\'t cease the attraction that bubbles back towards the surface, though, as they stare at each other, both terrified, but also relieved. \"I mean, you did freak me out,\" Sharpay admits with a scoff as she averts her gaze. \"But it was only because I thought I had freaked you out.\" So, they\\'re on the same page about that, then. God, what a terrible misunderstanding this has been. \"So, can we put this behind us?\" Gabriella asks, a hopeful thrill running down her spine as she anticipates Sharpay\\'s reaction and a hopeful reconciliation. However, Sharpay is not very quick to respond, instead pursing her lips as she stares ahead as if deep in thought, as if hesitant. \"We can forget it ever happened, just start with a clean slate,\" Gabriella adds quickly, in the hopes that this will make it convincing enough. A flash of hurt flickers in Sharpay\\'s eyes as she looks up to meet Gabriella\\'s eyes again, and it makes Gabriella wonder, but she quickly forgets when Sharpay breaks out into a small, breathtaking smile. \"That would be great.\" It\\'s not ideal, Gabriella thinks, because she doesn\\'t want to forget, especially now that she knows that it might have been mutual. However, if it gives her Sharpay back, she\\'ll gladly take it, and by all means, it makes her life a lot easier if she just puts this crush behind her. Even if her heartbeat still picks up as she stares into those brown eyes. \"So, where do we go from here?\" Sharpay pulls her from her thoughts, and Gabriella shrugs as she averts her gaze. \"Maybe we can hang out sometime, to catch up?\" she offers, and Sharpay lights up at that, which makes Gabriella grin. \"Why not do it right now? Do you have any plans?\" This makes Gabriella\\'s face fall. She already made plans to hang out with Troy after the rehearsal with Kelsi. As much as she wants to make up for lost time with Sharpay, she doesn\\'t want to just cancel on him. \"I actually made plans with Troy,\" she mumbles, and Sharpay\\'s eyes widen slightly as her mouth forms the shape of an \\'o\\', but then she nods in understanding. There\\'s still a glint of suspicion in her eyes, though, as she says, \"You guys are getting quite close, huh?\" Tucking a curl behind her ear bashfully, she nods. \"But I would love to hang out with you some other time.\" There\\'s a hint of disappointment of Sharpay\\'s eyes, but it quickly disappears as she nods firmly. \"Fabulous.\" They smile at each other for another moment, before Gabriella sighs. \"We should probably get up. I\\'m pretty sure Ryan and Kelsi are eavesdropping.\" Sharpay rolls her eyes in response. \"I hope they know I\\'m about to commit a double homicide.\" \"I mean, didn\\'t it all work out?\" Gabriella offers with a shrug, and Sharpay shakes her head. \"They still had no right, and you know how good I am at holding grudges.\" Giggling, Gabriella nods. That\\'s true, she knows that from being the subject of one of Sharpay\\'s grudges. They\\'ve finally moved past that now, though. Thank god. As she stops giggling, she stands up, ignoring Sharpay\\'s responding whine before she offers her a hand. Sharpay looks at it for a second, a little apprehensively, before smiling tightly as she puts her hand in Gabriella\\'s and let her pull straight up. A spark travels up Gabriella\\'s arm as they keep their hands locked for a second too long, but she ignores it and they share another smile. Then, Sharpay calls, \"You can come out now!\" Gabriella bursts out in giggles as an embarrassed Ryan and Kelsi walk out of the auditorium, while Sharpay just rolls her eyes at them. \"So, is everything okay?\" Kelsi asks, and Gabriella can\\'t help but smile as she hears the slight guilt in her voice. Sneaking a glance at Sharpay and grinning broadly, she nods. \"Yeah, we\\'re fine.\" A/N: I LIVE for Ryan and Kelsi scheming to get people to reconcile, tbh. They definitely overstepped here, though, and I don\\'t know if it\\'s a really good reconciliation scene anyway, but I hope you enjoyed! Also, I know I have been updating this weekly, but I won\\'t have time next week to update, so I\\'m skipping a week and I\\'ll be back with the next chapter on the 13th!

I\\'ve been very intrigued by this pair"},{"Movie":"High School Musical","Title":"I Did Not Leave South Side For This!","Author":"LittleOwlet","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10736210","Passage":"[Chapter 1] ['I Did Not Leave South Side For This! Chapter I - Introductions are made East High... Where do I begin? My name is Tia Brown and I am a senior in East High. Yeah. That\\'s a good start. I came to this school about three months ago having moved from Oregon because of my mother\\'s job. I thought this school was pretty cool when I looked around it with my mother. I mean all the students seem rather nice and the teachers seemed friendly enough. They also have pretty up to do facilities as well and have a very good reputation. My mother and I were both pleased with what we saw and the information we have gathered about the school as whole. So I chose to go there. At first I was thrilled with my decision and viewed it to ne the right one. However after about a week of going there I began to notice things... Odd things. No. Odd is a massive understatement. I began to notice huge enormities. They were only small at first and I rubbed them off as it just being my imagination. But they got bigger and bigger until I couldn\\'t ignore them anymore! The students sing... Now I know what you\\'re thinking, what wrong with that? Bit of singing doesn\\'t hurt anyone. However these guys don\\'t just sing. They sing disney princess style. They\\'ll just break into song and pull of an entire dance number like its nothing. It makes me feel really uncomfortable. My nerves are climbing up the wall, I\\'m scared that anyone will burst out into song at anytime. Apparently it\\'s just me who thinks something is up. I\\'ve checked with my friends and other people, they think nothing of it. In fact I don\\'t even think they know they\\'re singing and dancing half of the time. It\\'s like living in a freakin\\' musical. The students even call this place high school musical! I hate musicals and now I have to live in one. I did not leave South Side for this. What have I done to deserve this, Lord?! The amount of times I have been asked to join the drama department is unreal. Just because I play the ukulele it apparently automatically \\'one of the team.\\' I ain\\'t joining no drama department where hella creepy people just burst out singing. It\\'s surreal. I\\'ve had this blonde girl come up to me once and demand why I wasn\\'t joining the drama department. When I explained I hated theatrical stuff she gave me a flabbergasted look and stormed off in a fit of rage. My initial thought after meeting her for the first time was that she needed to tone down the pink. I see that blonde diva around school occasionally. She\\'s still trying to get me to join. \"Tia, it\\'ll be good for college!\" Or \"Tia, we need more ukulele players.\" I have no clue how she knows my name. I avoid her like the plague. Everyone seems to love the basketball them, which is fair enough. I mean I would be pretty supportive of my basketball team if they were one of the top in the country. It\\'s kind of strange East High doesn\\'t have a football team though. Just saying. Even the basketball team sings. I mean I understand the cheerleaders with them having specially plan routings and all. From what I\\'ve heard there was a massive moment when the Wildcats won the basketball final last year and then everybody just burst out singing. I would of gotten the fuck out of there as possible. The cheerleading team are lovely, not like my old cheerleading team. Seriously they were exactly like the mean popular girls you see on TV. I was on the colour squad last year. It was so much fun! This year it is my mission to get on the prom committee, the school news paper and the colour guard. That\\'s a lot, I know but a girl can be ambitious. I looked up from my journal to a voice calling to me. \"Tia!\" My face paled and a horrified look appeared on my face. It was her. That blonde bimbo from before. Okay Tia, I thought to myself and inhaled and exhaled calmly. Grab the ukulele and your books, then make a beeline out of there. I reached into my locker in a rush and grabbed my precious ukulele before grabbing the books needed for my next class, Home Economics. I slammed my locker shut and pretended I hadn\\'t notice the blonde. I tried to walk away in a dignified manner, my head held high. Note \\'tried\\', I didn\\'t make it two steps from my locker before I bumped into someone and my books went flying everywhere. I cursed under my breath and began to collect up the seven books I had dropped. \"I\\'m sorry!\" I shook my head as I gathered up the last of the books. \"It\\'s alright.\" I counted the books under my breath. I had six, where was seven? \"I do believe you are looking for this.\" A book was held out in front of me, the one I couldn\\'t find. \"Thank you.\" I said softly, smiling. I looked up to see a blonde dude wearing a beige hat with a blue ribbon. He was dressed in a white shirt, jeans and wore a sleeveless grey v neck sweater over the top of his white shirt. The startling similarity to the blonde bimbo made my smile faltered. He stopped smiling when he notice me frown. I grabbed the book and cradled my precious instrument before taking off again. For the second time that day I failed in getting away. A hand clamped down on my shoulder. I was forced to turn round. I plastered a smile on my face as I turned. \"Hello Sharpay.\" Who calls their kid Sharpay?! What was going through this girl\\'s mother\\'s head at the time of her birth? \"Why aren\\'t you in the drama club yet?\" I groaned and banged my head lightly against my hard books. We had this conversation every freaking time. I was seriously having a hard time keeping my cool. I looked up tiredly. \"I\\'ve already answered this a million times! Let me lay it in an way you will understand.\" My voice was rising and so was I in temper. \"I. Don\\'t. Do. Drama.\" The guy and Sharpay shared a look. \"You have your ukulele with you we could really use that.\" The blonde guy noticed. My hand wrapped itself protectively around the instrument. \"You\\'re not having my ukulele! Do you have any idea how long I\\'ve had this thing?\" I yelled, giving him a horrified look that he would even suggest such an idea. Sharpay gave her brother the same look and hit him lightly on the arm. \"Ryan! You can\\'t separate a musician from her instrument! It\\'s like removing the bread from butter, it\\'s not right.\" Now wasn\\'t the right time to comment that I didn\\'t have butter on my bread. Sharpay then turned her attention back to me. She pointed one very carefully manicured finger at me. It made me feel embarrassed about my stubby ones I bit. \"Tryouts. I expect to see you on Tuesday after school.\" She turned to her brother. \"Come Ryan!\" With that she started walking off, giving her hips that extra kick to attract the boys\\' attention. Ryan glanced to me and shrugged. He sent me a thumbs up and a friendly smile. \"See you on Tuesday, Tia.\" I watch him go. He seemed to be the friendlier one of the pair. I went on the assumption they were twins with them being in the same year and looking so startling alike. I sighed. I was not going along to some prancy drama club, no thank you. It isn\\'t my thing plus I\\' had to study for a Chemistry Test and write a Mythology essay. Much more important in my opinion. The bell sounded for my next class to start. Home economics here I come. I am not going to lie. I am having so much fun writing this. So what do you think Tia should do? Go to drama club or flunk it? What would you do if you were in High School Musical?'][Chapter 2] ['I Did Not Sign Up For This Chapter II - The Pit of Despair Home economics flewby as did the rest of the day. I had no more run-ins with Sharpay, thankfully. I saw her brother around the school once or twice. He waved at me a few times. He seemed friendly enough. The bell for lunch rang after I finished my Chemistry class. I exited the room as swiftly as possible, wanting to avoid all species of life. I really don\\'t do people. I headed down the corridor leading to my locker. On the outside my locker was as plain as you could get a locker. It wasn\\'t decorated with much inside it either, just a few pictures of my dog and my friends from Oregon. I input the code and opened my locker, trading out my bag for my books. My bag was a tan brown shoulder bag. It looked small but was bigger on the inside with all its hidden pockets. Like the Tardis really. I slung my bag over my shoulder before shutting my locker and reattaching the padlock. I let out a breathy sigh and ran a hand through my brown hair, the rings on my fingers not getting caught in my head this time, thankfully. I began to walk down the down the numerous halls of East High. I was about to turn a corner to get the canteen but my singing senses were a tingling. My ears pricked up the moment they heard the sound of pure happiness coming from the direction I wanted to go. I dived next to the wall and poked my head around the corner to see a group of freshman singing and dancing away like they didn\\'t have a care in the world. Was everyone in this school on drugs or something? That could provide so many answers if that was true... One of the freshmen spotted me and beckoned for me to join them. My eyes widened in shock. I had to get the fuck out of there. \"Hahaha, no.\" I replied, unamused. I was not getting infected with the musical virus as well! I flipped the birdie at him before legging it in the opposite direction of the singing and dancing teens. Looks like no lunch for me then. I would have to just wait until I got home. Food, then you shall be slayed by Tia\\'s pit of despair. In case you didn\\'t know, the pit of despair is what I call my stomach. It\\'s always hungry, never happy. It\\'s so demanding, A few more hours, my dear, and you shall be fed. I shushed my stomach as I crept away from the singing. Ugh, musicals. Have I ever emphasised how much I hate them? Like I want to stab the guy who first came up with musicals and make sure they never existed. Life would be so much better without them. I continued to walk straight down the hall, fully confident that I could find another way into the canteen to feed the pit of despair. I was striding forward, fully in my element. Nothing could stop me. Nothing could stand in my way. I was going get some food. I was going to... My thoughts trail off and I stopped dead in my tracks, earning some looks from passing students. A horrified look was on my face. Just up ahead were two bright pink lockers and outside those lockers stood two pink clothed people. The twins. My eyes widened and I looked back over my shoulder. The happy clappy freshmen were behind me and the dreaded pink parade was up ahead. I felt beads of sweat beginning to form on my forehead, my eyes frantically looking for somewhere to go. There was nowhere. But there was a notice board. My eyes homed in on it. If I could just pretend I was highly engaged with the notices for a few minutes then maybe the twins would pass me, allowing me to make my escape. This was the most crappiest five minute plan I had ever come up with but it had to work. My sanity depended on it. My eyes scanned over the notices, at first I spotted nothing of interest. Some stuff about clubs. I squinted, reading the notice about sport. Exercise, yuk. My form of exercise was turning a page in my book or walking to the kitchen to get a bag of chips. Definitely not signing up for any sport clubs. I stiffened when I heard the twins drawing nearer to me. Keep looking, stay interest. I thought to myself, gritting my teeth. My eyes began to look for other notices to read. I saw a notice tucked away behind all the others. Curiosity got the better of me and I peeled away the other messages to look at this particular one. I had to stand on my tiptoes to do so. My eyes turned into saucers when I got to look at the hidden notice. It was an ad for the school paper. I studied it, go to classroom 1A on Thursday 20th September, Lunchtime, to sign up for the school paper. I gasped in realisation and took a step back. It was September the twentieth today! What a coincidence. I thought to myself. It was like someone was giving me one coincidence after another. I decided not to dwell on that thought for too long before tearing the poster from the notice board and sprinting down the hall. Lunchtime would be over soon. Sharpay and Ryan gave me odd looks as I practically shoved them out of the way to get passed. I hopped around the corner before running up the nearest flight of stairs leading up to the first floor. Once I reached the top of the stairs I wandered down the hallway, trying to find 1A. I found it eventually. It was one of the tiny English classrooms, tucked away in a small alcove. My hand slipped on the handle and I looked through the window to check anyone was in there. There was about a group of six or seven students watching a guy about my age talk about something. I presumed this guy was the editor of the newspaper. I knocked on the door and pocked my head around it. I was met with mixed expressions, some annoyance, some delight. The editor raised an eyebrow as I grinned, waving a flyer. \"I saw your advertisement a few moments ago, I was wondering if it wasn\\'t too late to apply?\" Shyness creeped into my voice and I recoiled a little. Maybe this wasn\\'t such a good idea... The editor\\'s face lit up and he beckoned me in. \"Of course you can apply!\" He said in a singsong way. He gesticulated wildly. I bit my lip and a relived smile graced my face as I stepped inside, closing the door behind me. \"It\\'s Tia, right?\" A new voice piped up. My attention automatically snapped over to the voice. The speaker was a Asian girl. She was very pretty and had a friendly beam plastered on her face. \"We have Chemistry and Advanced English Lit together.\" I gave the girl the once over and vaguely recognised her from the classes we shared. \"I\\'m Jess! Hi!\" I gave her a salute, \"Tia, though you already know me it seems.\" Both of us shared a look of glee before the editor interrupted us. The editor wasn\\'t actually half bad looking, with dirty blonde hair and a adorable line of freckles decorating his nose. Puberty hadn\\'t quite finished with him yet but when it did it would turn him into a lady magnet. He handed me a form and smiled brightly. \"Tell me Tia, what\\'s your experience with writing?\" I opened up my mouth to speak but Jess ended up singing my praises. \"Oh she\\'s great! Comes top of the class in English Literature. Some of the pieces she churns out are amazing! You should seriously consider becoming an author, Tia.\" I blushed from embarrassment. Jess wasn\\'t exactly very modest was she? The editor beamed and clasped his hands together. \"Well it\\'s settled then. Welcome to the school paper, Tia.\" He patted me on the back in triumph. I looked around at the six other people. All were smiling but one. \"You\\'re just going to invite her in like that?! We had to do a formal letter and a example piece. It\\'s unfair, Louis, and you know that!\" Wow. Rude. \"Zach.\" Louis started, glaring at him. \"We are extremely low on members, we can\\'t keep the school paper going if there is no one to run it. Peter quit last week and if you haven\\'t noticed about five of our members are sick with the flu. We need the people. So I suggest you shut up.\" Zach mumbled an insult under his breath, which resulted in a glare from the guy next to him. \"Don\\'t speak about females in that way!\" The guy with the dreadlocks scolded, swiping Zach lightly around the head. Yeah! You go fellow feminist! We need more men like you in the world. Louis rubbed his temples and snapped at the two boys. \"Shut up both of you, you\\'re giving me another migraine again.\" Instantly the room shut up. Louis rolled his eyes and looked at me. \"Tia, I\\'m Louis, the editor. We have Alana.\" He gestured to a ginger. She looked up briefly from her phone and gave me a head nod. \"Hi...\" Louis\\' forced smile faltered a little. \"Then we have Mike and Eliza.\" Mike bumped chest with his hand twice before point his finger at me. Aww yeah, we were tight. Eliza leaned forward and sighed dreamily. She seemed to have her head stuck in the clouds. She looked to be a sophomore while Mike looked to be a junior. Louis quickly moved on. \"Then we have Doug.\" \"People just call me DD. It\\'s short for Dreadlocks Doug. Just call me that.\" The dreadlock dude gave me the peace sign and I gave a thumbs up back. \"Okie-Dokie DD.\" Doug looked to be a little older than me, 19 - suggesting he had been held back. Louis then adverted my attention to the guy sitting in the desk next to him, Zach. \"You\\'ve met Zach.\" There was bitter tone to Louis\\' voice, not that I don\\'t blame him. Zach seemed like a hard person to work with. He just grunted a me, acknowledging my presence. Finally Louis moved onto Jess. \"And you\\'ve met Jess.\" Jess gave me a peace sign and stuck her tongue out playfully, I couldn\\'t help but beam back. \"Wassup!\" Jess seemed like a pretty chill girl. I wouldn\\'t of minded if I chilled with her. Louis gave me another weary smile, rings were under his eyes and a cup of coffee was on the desk. Did this guy ever sleep? Was he a vampire or something? OH GOD IF HE STARTED SPARKLING IN THE SUN, I SWEAR TO GOD. He rubbed the back of his neck. \"So yeah, that\\'s everyone.\" The bell for class rang. Everyone packed up their bags and began to leave. \"See you all this time in two days! I want some good stories, people.\" I made to leave after Jess but Louis held me back. He rubbed the back of his neck. \"I really hope you enjoy your time here, Tia. You\\'ll meet the other members when they are back in school. Anyway! See you in a few days time!\" After that I was allowed to go. I walked straight out of that door, a idiotic smile plastered on my face. I fist punched the air in victory. Join the school paper, check. AN: Do you ever sit back and wonder what you are doing with your life besides roleplaying and writing fanfiction all day? I sure do! Thank you for your reviews my lovelies! QotD: How would you react if your life suddenly became a musical overnight?'][Chapter 3] ['I Did Not Leave South Side For This! Chapter III - Why does my Chemistry Teacher hate me? Oh fun times. Chemistry with Ms Roberts. God why did I take this class? It was so boring. My mother forced me into it I swear! \\'You\\'ll need a science to get into college.\\' She said. I tried to argue that we did all the sciences anyway. She didn\\'t listen. Ugh! Parents can be so frustrating sometimes. I listened to the teacher drone on about protons and electronic structure - nothing which really interested me. The only thing I was interested in learning about was which chemicals not to mix together so I could blow up something. However the teachers weren\\'t allowed to tell us that because it went against \\'health and safety regulations.\\' This is why I don\\'t enjoy school. It\\'s all these health and safety things that stop you from enjoying life. When my mother was my age there were none of these rules. People went batshit crazy. Now that I actually think about it I can see why the school board toughened up dramatically on health and safety... I sighed and leaned back in my chair, my thoughts somewhere else. \"Miss Brown.\" That caught my attention and I suddenly became very alert. \"Yes?\" I asked innocently. Ms Robert\\'s eyes zoned in on me and she folded her arms smugly. \"What is the word equation for aerobic respiration?\" I raised a eyebrow. This was Chemistry! Why was she testing me on Biology all of the sudden? \"Um...It is...\" I stumbled, desperately trying to remember the answer to this incredibly simple question. It\\'s always the simple questions that get you, I find. Anyone else agree? No? Just me? Well okay then. Ms Roberts leaned against her desk, looking very proud with herself to catch a student off guard. She clicked a pen and began to issue a detention. My eyes widened at the detention and I panicked, shouting out the answer. \"THE ANSWER IS OXYGEN PLUS GLUCOSE CREATES CARBON DIXIODE, WATER AND ENERGY.\" Everyone stared at me and I recoiled. Ms Roberts stopped writing and clicked her pen before putting it down. A annoyed look was plastered on her face as she turned to address me. \"Well Miss Brown, it looks like you do know you Biology. It\\'s a good thing you do because we will be swapping to it next semster.\" There was a groan of protest from the class. Ms Roberts rolled her eyes and clasped her hands. \"Now don\\'t groan. If you think that\\'s bad then you\\'re going to hate the project I\\'m giving you.\" Another groan, louder this time, erupted from the class. \"The topic of the project is the history of the periodic table! I don\\'t care how you present this project, unless it is not appropriate for school.\" She glared at some dude at the back of the class. I had the uncomfortable feeling something had happened before otherwise she wouldn\\'t of felt the need to say that last part. She walked over to her desk and picked up a piece of paper. \"Now I have assigned you project partners. You cannot change your partners nor bribe me to change them.\" She sent a dirty look to a girl in my class, she shrank back from embarrassment. Then she began to read out a list of names who I did not know. The only names I recognised were Zach and Doug. I glanced over to Doug and he waved at me. His feet were up on the desk and he obviously didn\\'t give a crap about science. God that guy was cool. \"Jasmin and Tia. You\\'ll be working together on this project.\" Ms Roberts read out and gave me a warning look. What was her problem with me, seriously? I was a little angel. There was a gentle tap on my shoulder and I turned around in my seat to face the person behind me. It was a girl with short brown hair and strands of pink in her hair. She wore a teal tank top and different wristbands decorated her arms. She leaned forward in her seat, arms on desk. \"Hi! I\\'m Jasmin, your project partner, you can just call me Jay.\" Her kind look and friendly grin made me smile. \"I\\'m Tia, it\\'s lovely to meet you.\" She smiled at me warmly and nodded. \"Oh I know! I\\'ve always wanted to get to know you. You seem pretty cool.\" I tipped my head to the side inquisitively, trying to figure this girl out. \"Thanks.\" There was a light cough from the front of the room and I realised that the whole of the room had gone silent. I flushed from the embarrassment of having the teacher call me out for talking again and turned to face the front. \"Sorry Miss.\" She gave me a warning look before addressing the class again. Jess roll her eyes and shot me a amused look from the other side of the classroom. And that is how the rest of the lesson went. Boring I know, but it was normal. Good old normal. No singing or dancing endured. It was as boring as a Chemistry lesson could get and that made me happy. It was nice to have a period where nobody sang for once. If only the rest of my high school experience was like that. The amount of stress I would lose would be amazing. Seriously, you try being on your guard all the time and getting skittish at any given thing. Not good. I was pretty sure I would end up having a nervous breakdown at some point if people kept singing. So this was nice and calming. The bell rang, indicating the end of fourth period and lunch. I began to pick up my books and put them in my bag when Jess walked over to me. I glanced up to see her sunny face. I beamed back. \"You coming?\" She asked and nodded to the door with her head. I rolled my eyes and stuffed the rest of my belongings in my bag. This had become a routine over the last few weeks. Jess or I would wait for each other at the end of Lit and Chemistry before heading off to the cafeteria to eat with our friends. I was pleased with myself. Over the last few weeks I had managed to befriend most of the newspaper team, Allana and Michael being the only exceptions as they were not in my year. Even Zach had managed to stop being so sore towards me! I now could call them my friends. It was sweet. I stood up and walked over to Jess. I glanced over my shoulder and saw Jay still tidying up. I shared a look with Jess. She followed my gaze and simply shrugged. I gestured for her to wait. \"Jay.\" I spoke in a soft and curious tone. My project partner looked up from her desk and grinned friendly at me. \"Hello again!\" She said in that ever cheerful voice of hers. \"Hey... Do you want to come and eat with us?\" I threw Jess a questioning look, she gave a thumbs up to say she was okay with it. \"We need to discuss what we are doing for our project afterall.\" Jay\\'s whole face lit up. I swear to God I have never seen anyone more happy for being offered to eat with some people. Jay nodded vigorously and slung her messenger bag over her shoulder. I half smiled. \"Great!\" Jay followed me to where Jess was patiently waiting. The three of us exited and headed down the hall towards the food hub. It was the pit of despair\\'s feeding time again. We reached the hall within couple minutes and were waiting in for our food. Jess grabbed a veggie burger while I had a cone of fries and a egg sandwich. Jay picked the healthy option and went with the soup of the day - carrot. She also grabbed a fruit salad. She only had water when offered a drink, the opposite of my sugary coke. \"What\\'s with all the healthy stuff?\" I quizzed as we wandered up the stairs to our spot where we usually ate lunch. \"Hmm?\" Jay looked down at her food. \"Oh! I\\'m Vegan.\" She answered simply. Jess\\' eyes widened, she was vegetarian but not vegan. \"Wow... That\\'s quite a commitment. I don\\'t think I could ever live without cheese or milk.\" I glanced to Jess. \"I can\\'t live without meat, how impressed do you think I am?\" My Asian friend rolled her eyes as we sat. We were greeted with a round of hellos. Doug fist bumped me as I settled down next to him. His dreadlocks game was riding strong. I could feel the epicness of the dreadlocks reflecting on me. I subconsciously ran a hand through my curly brown locks because of it. Damn, I wish he would embarrass me with his utterly fabulous hair. Jay sat on my other side and was looking uneasy. I was about to devour my fries when I remembered that I had invited Jay to sit with us, therefore it was I whom must introduce her into the group. I placed the fries down and my stomach grumbled in protest. I shushed it before smiling at my friends. \"Everybody, this is Jay.\" I placed a reassuring hand on Jay\\'s shoulder. \"Jay these bunch of weirdos are Louis, Doug but everyone calls him DD, Zach and you\\'ve already met Jess.\" She gave a warm smile and a friendly wave. \"Hi!\" Louis beamed back in reply while Zach gave his usual Zach greeting and grunted. Doug held up his hand for a high five, Jay grinned and high fived Doug. \"Wassup, Bluejay?\" Doug asked. Jay laughed in response and hit him playfully. I looked from Jay to Doug in confusion. \"Do you guys know each other or something?\" \"We know each other from drama club and have a few classes together.\" Doug explained and chuckled at my face when it paled. \"D...Dr..Drama Club?\" I stuttered, checking if I heard correct. Doug crossed his arms and confirmed my fears. \"Oh yeah, we know all about how you didn\\'t show up for the auditions a few weeks ago. Sharpay got pretty pissed, the whole drama group knew about it. She still wants you to audition. She thinks you have real potential.\" Zach let out a laugh at that last line and Louis shot him a look. \"We\\'re holding auditions again in a few weeks because we are short on seniors for the senior spring musical.\" Jay piped up quietly. I rubbed my temples. \"Oh god. That\\'s means the blasted Evans pair will be chasing me again! Do I need this extra stress?\" I said to no one in particular and threw my hands in the air in a melodramatic fashion. I put my head in my hands and sighed, having lost my appetite all of sudden. Doug chuckled to himself softly. \"Just go, Tia. It will shut the pink demon up.\" \"He does make a valid point.\" I heard Jess say. I sighed irritably and removed my hands from my face. I must of had a extremely sour look on my face for Louis to offer me a big newspaper assignment. \"Hey Tia, if it helps our sports\\' reporter is still on holiday and I need someone to cover to big basketball game coming up next week.\" A look of astonishment appeared on my face. Louis wanted me to cover the basketball final between the West High Knights and the Wildcats? Louis rolled his eyes at my face, his eyes were laughing at me. \"No I\\'m not joking before you start. I really need this story in the bag and I think you\\'re perfect for the job.\" A light blush crept over my cheeks and I looked at Jess apologetically. She waved a hand dismissively to indicating it was fine blushing from her boyfriend. My face lit up and I adverted my attention back to Louis. \"Thank you so much! I would love to!\" Doing this story meant I could interview the players of both teams and let me tell you there are some hunks on those teams I would not mind getting down and funky with. Zach scowled. \"But we need a photographer. It\\'s no use her going to a game and not taking pictures. Our photographer quit, remember?\" Louis glared at Zach, sometimes I wondered how they were friends. \"I am aware of that fact, Zach.\" Louis spat in disgust. Jay raised her hand shyly. \"I could take the pictures.\" She offered. The attention of the entire news team was instantly on her. She recoiled a little under the attention. \"I mean I take photography classes so I just figured...\" She trailed off. Louis gesticulated wildly, getting excited. He stood. \"No no! This is perfect!\" He flashed a grin at Jasmin before turning to look at me. \"How do you feel about having Jay tag along with you?\" I gave him a thumbs up. \"I\\'m totally cool with it, besides it will be nice. Gotta spend some quality time with friends.\" Jay\\'s whole face shone like the sun. I\\'ve got to really stop complimenting that girl, one day her face is going to blind me. Louis\\' grin grew. \"Perfect! I look forward to reading your story.\" Then the bell for the end of lunch went. AN: Dudes, this took such a long time to write! I hope it was worth the wait. Big chapter coming next. The first of the High School Musical 3 songs comes. A lot of wtfing will endure. I\\'m reading the Mortal Instruments at the moment and it\\'s so good! I love Jace so much. Simon was my favourite but eh. QoTD: Your life can only be summed up by one song, what is it and why?'][Chapter 4] ['I Did Not Leave South Side For This! Chapter IV - I Swear I\\'m Not Crazy \"Yo Tia!\" Jay\\'s voice cut threw the crowd of students and reached my ears. I was standing at the entrance to the court, having texted Jay earlier this morning to meet me there. I lifted my head to see where the voice had come from. I grinned when I saw Jay making her way through the crowd towards me. I wanted to fit the atmosphere of the game so I wore a red top with white shorts, my brown hair was in pigtails and a dark brown fedora say snugly on top of my head. If you\\'re going to be a journalist, you\\'ve got to get into the mind of a journalist. Though, granted, I felt more like Perry the Platypus from Phineas and Ferb then an actual journalist. Jay was not much better herself, she was lugging around all this fancy photography equipment, which my brain would not allow me to understand. She looked exhausted by the time she reached me. I would be too, dragging all that totally unnecessary equipment around everywhere with me. Jay wore jeans, a white tank top and a red scarf around her waist. She also wore red converses, that I thought were rather snazzy. I removed the pencil from my fedora and scribbled down a note to order a pair when I had the money. \"Tia! Thanks for inviting me!\" Jay greeted me in her ever cheery manner. She beamed at me and we hugged awkwardly. It was an awkward hug but not as awkward as when I hug my step siblings all the way in Canada. \"Hey it\\'s no problem!\" I grinned back, tugging on my pigtail nervously. This was my first story and I did not want to fuck this up. \"Shall we head in?\" I head nodded to the set of double doors. Jay seemed to agree with me as she had opened the door and was searching for our seats. We found them in the end. We had front row seats, reserved specially for us. I know this was only a school basketball game, but boy did I feel posh with reserved seats! The Wildcats entered the court, resulting in a deafening cheer from my side of the court. I cheered too. Even though I had never been one for sports I had to admit that the atmosphere of the room was getting to me. But exercise in general? Ew. All the exercise I did was tap my finger on the television remote to change the channel. Though I did get my weekly run when Sharpay dared to approach me. The thought of exercise makes me tired. The West High Knights entered a few minutes later. A massive cheer erupted from the opposition\\'s side of the room. Jay nudged me and grinned. \"There are some cuties on that team, especially the one with blonde hair and dimples.\" I raised an eyebrow at her inquisitively. \"And how would you know that?\" She winked at me and gestured to the camera. \"Super zoom.\" I laughed in reply and adverted my attention back to the court. The game had just begun and was in full swing. frantically scribbled away, desperate to catch every single detail of this game that would decide the fate of our school basketball team. Jay was clicking away like she had done this a million times before, like a true professional. Or she just liked the sound of the click of the camera, I hadn\\'t decided yet. Either way she was awesome. The basketball captain wasn\\'t half bad looking, he moved as fast as a plane and as swift as a bird on the court. He passed the ball to one of his fellow team mates, a tall guy with dark skin. I tipped my head to the side and raised an eyebrow. I was laughing behind my eyes. I had seen this guy before. He was forever trying to woo the pink princess while I was forever trying to avoid her. We had accidentally bumped into each other in the hallway once when I was trying to outrun Sharpay and Ryan before they spotted me. He ended up knocking me over. He apologised profoundly and gave me a home ales muffin to settle my troubles - which was sweet. Yeah. I liked the muffin man. There was a roar from the Wildcats\\' crowd. I looked up confused and found I had missed a goal. \"Damn it!\" I yelled, massaging my temples. I had been so caught up in capturing every detail, I forgot to capture the first goal of the game. Wow. Idiot alert. \"Don\\'t worry about it.\" Jay said calmly, still clicking away. \"I got it on film.\" My face lit up for like the fifth time that morning. \"Thank you so much.\" Jay kept her attention on the game but waved a hand idly. \"No sweat! I\\'m the photographer, it\\'s my job to capture everything .\" So that\\'s how the rest of the game went, Jay capturing the important parts of the game, like goals and fouls, while I described the swift movements of the players and the atmosphere of the crowd. Everything was going smoothly until there were sixteen minutes left in the game. The Wildcats and West High Knight had just returned from half time. The game was just getting back into motion when it started. \"Sixteen, Sixteen minutes left better get it done.\" I heard the chanting and pressed down on my pencil, making the nib snap. I cursed and looked up, my ears intently listening to check if I had heard someone singing or it was just my imagination. My eyes narrowed as I scanned for the culprit. I must of looked pretty weird for Jay to ask me if I was okay. \"Hmm? Oh? Oh! Yeah I\\'m fine. Couldn\\'t be better.\" Jay raised an eyebrow, clearly creeped out. \"Okay...\" She mumbled. \"Hey Jay.\" \"Yes?\" \"You haven\\'t heard any chanting, have you?\" I asked, my eyes wide. I was too young to be going to crazy. \"Chanting? You mean the cheerleaders?\" I shook my head, my eyes turned into saucers when I heard the chanting again, I stuck a finger in the air. \"Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen more minutes get ready, game on!\" \"That chanting.\" Jay looked at me like I was mad. \"I don\\'t hear any chanting. Maybe the heat is getting to you, Tia? It is awfully hot in here.\" I shrunk down in my seat. \"Maybe it is.\" I mumbled, tapping my pencil on my pad. If chanting was here then this was a situation I couldn\\'t GTFO of. \"Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen minutes left running out of time! Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen more minutes till it\\'s on the line! Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen minutes left gotta get it done. Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen more minutes till we\\'re number 1!\" My face paled, the chanting was coming the basketball team. \"Let\\'s go team!\" The Coach called, clapping his hands together to get the team more motivated. I suddenly sat up and frowned. I was sick of people thinking I was crazy because I insisted this school was a living musical. You know what? I was going to prove it to all those doubters on reddit and beyond that this school, my school, was a living musical. With that in mind I drew out my dicatophone and hit the record button on the side of the instrument. I thrust it into the air, reading for the world to hear the sounds of High School Musical. AN: I\\'m separating this chapter into two because it\\'s going to be incredibly long and I will probably never update for you lovelies otherwise! Sorry if this chapter was a little boring! I am very tired and it took a long time for me to find the inspiration to write this. The second part of chapter will be up by the end of the month and that is a promise! QotD: So what did you guys think of this chapter? What do you think will happen next?'][Chapter 5] ['I Did Not Leave South Side For This! Chapter V - Why Does Nobody Here Know They\\'re Singing? \"Gotta get it together.\" The captain started to sing first, playing basketball like he had been doing it all his life. He probably had, knowing that his father was Coach Bolton. \"Yeah, pull up and Shoot, Score!\" Yet an another incredible goal for the Wildcats. \"Are ya ready? Are ya with me?\" I broke down laughing, causing me to receive some looked. All I could picture now was the wildcats in spongebob squarepants outfits. \"Are ye ready, kids?\" I mumbled to myself, still giggling. The rest of the basketball team seemed to respond to his question almost immediately, like this song had been planned beforehand. \"Team Team Team Yeah!\" I scowled, what kind of people sang about exercise? Crazy people, that\\'s what. \"Shake em with the crossover.\" The captain sang as he dribbled around an opponent. He then passed the ball to Chad. I recognised him from his iconic t-shirts and frizzy hair. We had spoke once when we had bumped into each other into the hall. He seemed nice enough. The crowd screamed. \"Wildcats!\" My eyes widen. Fuck no. Now the crowd was getting involved. I looked around me, everyone in the crowd was immersed in the game. Did they not realise they were watching a totally random song number unfold on the court? \"Tell me, what are we here for?\" The captain asked as he marched along. \"To win.\" The crowd replied. My ears ran from the shouting. The fizzy haired dude and the captain ran along both sides of the court, trying to get the ball. Chad swiped it and got it to the captain. Score. There was a massive cheer from our side of the team. I had hoped that the singing would stop after that as the numbers I had experienced before never actually lasted that long Oh God I was so wrong. Hell had only just begun. \"Oh this is our school\\'s most important game in the history of games, let\\'s start singing and we\\'ll win.\" I said with as much sarcasm as I could muster. I was really beginning to hate this game. \"Cause we know that we\\'re the best team.\" The captain passed our spot at the front, causing Jay and I to stare. His biceps were rippling. He was covered in sweat and- No Tia, this was not the time to get distracted by hot bodies, I thought to myself. I blinked a few times and forced myself to focus back on the game. I sat down, placing my dictaphone besides me so that the music could still be heard, and began to jot notes down about how weird this game had gotten. Jay shared a look with me, which made us both flush. We knew exactly what was running through each other\\'s head. I would tap that. By that we meant the basketball captain, or Troy as I was later informed. The Wildcats\\' coach clapped a few times, trying to get his boys enthused about the game. \"Come on Boys. Come on Boys. Come On!\" If I had been the coach then I would have promised my team humongous bars of chocolate, everyone likes chocolate. Well. Unless you\\'re allergic, or a vegan, or just don\\'t like chocolate in general. Then you, my friend, are strange. The only reason I haven\\'t gotten fat from chocolate is having to run halfway across the school to get away from Sharpay, surprising it really does keep a person fit. Either that or I have a really fast metabolism. It\\'s probably the latter. \"The way we play tonight. Is what we leave behind. It all comes down to right now. It\\'s up to us.\" \"Wow. Real motivational, Captain.\" I muttered to myself sarcastically. \"Nothing like stating the obvious.\" I turned my attention to other players on the team and began to scribbled down notes on them. Why did it have to be about the captain all the time? \"So what are we gonna be?\" Screamed Troy. I leaned back in my seat, pulling a disturbed face. Screaming was a bit much for a school basketball game. However his team seemed to be reared on by the ludicrous screaming of their captain and responded with just as much force in their tones. \"T-E-A-M. Team!\" They ever did those stupid fist punches guys do when they are pumped. Another three points was added to the scoreboard, but this time for West High. I jotted it down and wondered if the West High Knights were having the same reaction I was. A few of them looked a bit perplexed at least. Troy threw his arms in the air in celebration of the goal. \"Gotta work it out. Turn it on!\" The crowd seemed over the moon at another goal and cheered as the Wildcats were winning once more. The atmosphere of the hall was exhilarating. \"Come on!\" Yelled the ever faithful wildcat cheerleaders. Screw those ladies, they were the backbone of this entire uncalled for musical number. Yeah. Screw you attractive cheerleaders. My head was really beginning to hurt now from all the shouting and singing. The court was hot and stuffy. There is only so much of sweaty guys and rippling biceps a woman can take. I was sick of watching basketball and that number. All I wanted to do was go home, eat cake, put Taylor Swift on and scroll down Tumblr. Let\\'s get real. Tumblr was the babe. But unfortunately I was condemned to this hell and get this story, people were depending on me. Maybe it was a bad idea to join the school newspaper. \"This is the last time to get it right. This is the last chance to make it our night. We gotta show what we\\'re all about.\" The captain and his team mates continued to sing. \"Work Together. This is the last chance to make our mark. History will know who we are! This is the last game so make it count, it\\'s now or never.\" And that\\'s how to rest of the game went. Troy and his crew singing their hearts out to some basketball game that wouldn\\'t even be that important in the long run. That was until there were sixty seconds left to the game and Troy fell. Uh oh, man down. I winced at the captain skidding across the floor. That had got to hurt. The referee blew his whistle and instantly Troy was swarmed around by his concerned team mates. I stood up, notebook in hand, desperately trying to see what had happened to the boy. We couldn\\'t see anything due to the amount of people crowding around him. People were stupid. You want to get the juiciest gossip for a story and people just happen to be in the way, preventing you from doing so. I shared a look with Jay, who head nodded to the court. She was asking if we should run onto it and see what was up with Troy for the newspaper. I sighed and shook my head before sitting back down. As much as I wanted to pester people with questions that would have to wait until after the game. I was no Nancy Drew and Jay was no Sherlock Holmes, no matter how much either of us wanted to be. That would be cool though. I would love to be Nancy Drew and fight crime. I would be awesome at it. Ah nerds and their whimsical fantasies. Troy was soon up on his feet again. He looked fine, if anything just a bit shaken up. I rolled my eyes at him. He was such a baby. The whole hall went quiet as Troy stood and the wildcat fans lifted red and white cardboard, creating white paws on a red background. I turned to stare at this is confusion. I didn\\'t realise we had to bring cardboard with us. I looked to the guy next to me and saw him removing the cardboard next to his seat. I looked next to mine and sure enough there was a piece of white cardboard. I shrugged and picked up, raising it over my head. The lights were lowered and a spotlight found its way to Troy. What the fuck. I was pretty sure that basketball games didn\\'t have spotlights, that was more of a drama thing. Drama... I lingered on that thought and my eyes widened when I realised what was happening. Solo. I was forced to watch in perturbed dread Troy Bolton, the most popular guy in school, sing a solo without the help of his team. He opened his mouth. I shut my eyes. Here it comes. \"Troy. Trooooooyyyyyy!\" Someone sang, a female from what I could make out. My eyes opened and I removed the piece of cardboard above my head. I pulled a face of puzzlement and looked around for the singer. I spotted Troy and followed his gaze. A pretty girl in a white dress just was stood up, singing down at Troy. Everyone remained oblivious to this. \"Right now I can hardly breath.\" Troy answered, his breathing heavy. The random girl smiled down at him lovingly. I felt myself nearly puke from the sickly sweet look upon both their faces. Ugh love, gross. Who needed love a person when you had the Internet? That\\'s what I call true love. I looked around me, completely perplexed by what was going on. How could the rest of the hall not see this? Was I high? Was that the reason why I could see people singing? I don\\'t do drugs so that ruled out that possibility. I wasn\\'t drunk either so... Magic. Magic had to be the answer. Magic was what was forcing me to live through this musical hell. Fuck you magic. \"Oh, you can do it. Just know that I believe.\" The girl drew a hand to her chest and encouraged the captain. I raised an eyebrow at her. That was a little bit cliché. This was not a movie or anything. The captain stood straighter. \"And that\\'s all I really need.\" My eyes adverted to Troy, a let out a dry laugh. Are you kidding me? He just fell. He needs to be checked over by the school nurse. He is not fine. Singing does not magically heal people, unless you were Apollo. If Apollo is reading this then I meant not offence by what I said, I love your work. \"Then come on.\" The darkness was beginning to fade. \"Make me strong.\" The girl in the white dress nodded at the captain reassuringly and proudly. \"It\\'s time to turn it up. Game on!\" The darkness disappeared completely and the game commenced like nothing had happened. Was I the only one who had epiphanies around here?! I will spare you the details of the rest of the game. It\\'s as boring as basketball can get. Basically some guy, who can\\'t play basketball, was brought on with sixteen seconds left and ended up scoring the final goal that the Wildcats needed to win. So yay! We were the champions. I half expected the hall to break out singing Queen\\'s \\'We Are The Champions.\\' But it appeared they had no taste for classic rock music. Jay and I made our way down to the court so we could interview the players for the school newspaper. \"Jay.\" \"Yes Tia?\" Jay jumped down the steps leading the court. She waited for me to catch up, smiling at me all the while. When I caught up to her I was gasping for breath. Like I said I am highly unfit. \"You didn\\'t happen to hear the singing that happened in the game, did you?\" I huffed, my tone had a little hope in it. Jay just looked confused. \"Singing? You mean Troy and Gabriella?\" My eyes filled with hope. \"Yes!\" My voice was full of excitement at the possibility someone else heard them. \"The black haired girl and the Wildcats\\' captain! Yes them!\" Jay\\'s face cleared of all confusion and she beamed at me. \"Yes! They are singing, right over there!\" She pointed to where the basketball captain and his girlfriend were walking hand in hand, humming a sweet tune. My face fell as we wandered over to the pair. Jay, you little troll. \"Troy!\" Jay called rushing over with all her equipment. I trailed behind, basking in my thoughts. Troy\\'s face lit up when he spotted Jay, they obviously knew each other. \"Oh hey Jay! I didn\\'t know you were on the school paper.\" Gabrielle waved a small hello and a smile at my friend. When I reached them they were talking about the big game. Jay grinned when I reached the trio. \"Guys, this is my new friend Tia.\" I gave a small hello and a wave. Gabriella look like she recognised my name. \"Are you the same Tia who bunked out on auditions?\" I sighed and lifted my hands sheepishly. \"Well yes, that would be me. I was told that I drove Sharpay insane since I didn\\'t come.\" A small smile played on the edge on my lips. Gabriella grinned at me in her oh so sweet way. \"Oh yeah, she was super mad. But that\\'s your choice whether to come or not! Let nobody pressure you into doing anything.\" She placed a hand on my shoulder in comfort. I stared at it in alarm. I did not consent to this contact. Get your carefully manicured hand off my shoulder foul demon! Gabriella noticed how uncomfortable I had become from the touch and removed her hand. She shot me an apologetic look with a smile. My eyes narrowed at her, making the smile vanish. I lifted my head in the air and turned my attention to Troy. \"Troy, can we get an interview for the school newspaper?\" I asked with as much politeness as I could find. I had to dig real deep to find the politeness lurking inside of me. Troy answered with a smile. \"Sure! Anything for the school!\" I sighed. Was everyone here a 2D character in a movie or something? I proceeded to ask him a long line of questions, recording it all with my dictaphone. Jay took photos of us all. She took so many I was tempted to tell her that this was not a photoshoot. To finish I decided to ask a question that was lingering in the back of mind. \"Great singing back there in the game Troy. That duet with your wonderful girlfriend was simply spot on.\" Troy and Gabriella shared a look of bewilderment. I raised an eyebrow. \"Tell us what was that pretty little number called?\" I asked anxiously. I needed answers to why everyone sang at this school. I would go to high hell to find them. Troy looked at me like I was mad, a look I had gotten use to over these pass few months. \"I\\'m sorry but I have no clue on what you\\'re talking about.\" \" What? \" AN: End of chapter! I\\'m such a tease ;). This took so long. This is for the anon who said they wanted Tia to have more interaction with the canon characters of HSM. Tia is actually a canon character, she just doesn\\'t have a name. Go watch I want it all and you\\'ll see her and Jay. Thank you for reading my lovelies!'][Chapter 6] ['I Did Not Leave South Side For This! Chapter VI - Not The Best First Impression Ugh sleep. Ugh chocolate. Ugh life. You can probably tell by the ughs at how grumpy I was when I walked into school that day. I had stayed up until one in the morning finishing that god forsaken article because it was due in the next day. But then again this was happen why you went on a Pokemon binge to distract yourself from thinking you were going crazy. Richu shall always been my saviour. Always. I stormed into school, determined to hand in this article. I received a few looks as I rushed by. For some reason people thought running in corridors was odd. Pfft, strange people. Whenever I run down corridors I like to imagine I\\'m the tenth doctor running from some freaky space alien. I strode right over to my locker, put in the code and pulled it open with so much force I swear it was going to break off. Carelessly, I threw in the books needed for the different lessons I had that day. I slammed the door shut and began to jog to the news room. Why am I jogging? I found myself asking. I must be really going crazy, I never jog anywhere. I ran up an endless number of stairs before reaching the first floor. I will admit that I was practically dying by the time I clambered up the last few steps. I was pulling myself up the stairs by the bannister and making noises of a walrus in extreme pain, it was that bad. I\\'m an unfit bitch. I forced myself to get on my feet again and head to this news room. This stupid article wasn\\'t going to magically deliver itself, although I wished it would. I reached the news room and raised an arm in the air in triumphant. A grin broke out on my face. I had finally made it my destination. No more stress for little old me! I placed my hand on the door handle to open the door... Only to find it was locked. \"What the fuck.\" I stated aloud, trying the door a few more times. The door refused to budge. I let out a groan of frustration and leaned against the door. Louis had said he would be here, he wasn\\'t. Now I was forced to carry around this godforsaken article all day as well as trying to do all my other day to day tasks, i.e. avoiding the blonde bimbo, also known as Sharpay Evans. I closed my eyes and sighed. Life sucked balls sometimes. A voice broke through the silence. \"If you\\'re looking for the newspaper then it\\'s the next classroom.\" It sounded slightly foreign. But not at the same time from the way the person had pronounced their t\\'s. Were they Jamaican? Wow, you\\'re an idiot, Tia. I opened my eyes to see a man, a very tall man making me feel even smaller than my already short 5\\'3\" frame. He had coco coloured skin and black hair. He had a button nose and chubby cheeks, indicating he still had some growing to do. Yeah this dude was Jamacian for sure. He was in a white shirt. The shirt had multiple colours on it, forming some weird modern art. I don\\'t really like art, to be honest. His denim jeans were well loved, as obvious from the light, sandy colour to the blue denim. He wore light blue toms on his feet, choosing to go sock less. I stared at his feet in horror, who didn\\'t wear socks out in public? I mean I had heard countless stories about the sock less species but had never actually met one in person. \"You\\'re not wearing any socks. You monster.\" I thought aloud. My eyes widened. Oh God, this was why people didn\\'t like me. I always spoke my mind. I frowned in confusion when I heard laughter. I looked at the boy quizzically, this was not the respond I had been anticipating. A smile broke out on his adorable little baby face. \"That is such a great first impression.\" His eyes met mine and he grinned at me. \"I\\'m Tico.\" He spoke in a warm tone, making me smile back. \"I\\'m presuming you\\'re Tia. Louis said you would be a little disorientated, considering you\\'re new to the paper and everything.\" I just stared at him, trying to make heads and tails of the situation. He tipped his head to the side and studied my face. Intelligence lingered behind those eyes of amusement. \"You\\'re not really a talker are you?\" \"Not really.\" I answered, finally finding my voice. \"I\\'m more of a complainer to be perfectly honest.\" Tico rolled his eyes. \"Pessimist.\" He noted, grinning cheekily before heading to the next classroom on the right. I raised an eyebrow. Well that was rude. \"Hey!\" I yelled, hurrying after him. \"For the record, I\\'m a realist, not a pessimist.\" Tico waved a hand dismissively. \"Whatever!\" He said in a singsong voice before pushing the door to the news room open. I picked up the pace and rushed in after him. There were only guys in the room, Louis, Tico and Zach. Zach glared at me and shook his head disapprovingly. Just to infuriate him I winked and beamed back in reply. He just rolled his eyes, making me laugh. A corner of Zach\\'s mouth edged up into a smile. \"Will you two stop flirting?\" Louis interrupted, his voice contained a tired edge to it. My eyes widened and I opened my mouth in protest. He put up a hand. \"Tia, please hand me the article. I\\'m too tired to argue.\" Well excuse you. I opened my satchel and drew out the precious parchment. Louis held out his hand expectantly and I obliged by handing him it. His eyes scanned over the article and a few moments later he smiled faintly. \"This is excellent, Tia. Maybe I should consider swapping you and Tico around. He can become in charge of the weather instead.\" Tico gasped dramatically and put a hand to his head. \"Oh no! You mustn\\'t do such a thing! It would kill me inside.\" Louis shot him a look. \"Quit being so melodramatic.\" Tico crossed his arms and grinned. \"But being dramatic is what I do best.\" He chuckled when Louis tutted. Tico turned his attention to me. \"Thanks for covering the big game for me.\" He paused and then pouted. \"Stupid flu. Mama Tico will never let her little cubs in when they get the sniffles.\" He wiped his eyes. This dude was a terrible actor, ain\\'t going to lie. Tico quickly changed the subject, deciding he had lingered on the previous subject for too long. \"So what have you got next Tia?\" \"Double English!\" Zach piped up. All eyes homed in on him. I raised an eyebrow and gave him a creeped out look. How the heck did he know my timetable? It wasn\\'t like I exactly complained about English. Was he like Edward Cullen from those poorly written Twilight books? Oh God, was my sort of friend a vampire?! Did I need to break into my mother\\'s \\'apocalypse emergency pack\\' and find the garlic? Come to think of it why did my mother even have an apocalypse emergency pack? Tico\\'s voice cut through the awkward silence \"Stalker...\" Zach looked like he was about to melt into a pool of embarrassment. He opened his mouth to speak but was promptly shut up again by the judging looks aimed at him. Tico suddenly looped his arm through mine and turned away. \"Alright, hon, let\\'s get you to Double English, coincidentally I\\'m in that class too.\" AN: Ugh this to so long to write! I\\'m so sorry about that! This chapter isn\\'t as entertaining as the others because I needed some character development and to introduce Tico! Tico is courtesy of my friend, Tiff. More will be on the way soon and there will be longer chapters, I promise.'][Chapter 7] ['AN: I thought I would put the author\\'s note at the top this time so all of you can read this. Sorry I haven\\'t updated for four months! I have been so busy with exams. I\\'m not going to lie for a long time I couldn\\'t find inspiration to write this chapter. I didn\\'t know how to write this chapter! I\\'ve written other chapters to this story, just I needed to write this chapter to submit the other chapters. Plus I\\'ve been working on my original novel so that\\'s taken a lot of my time. Although I know my novel will not be finished any time soon!

Just a question, is this going to end up as a lo ve story or just a (absolutely amazing) story about a girl? Answer : thank you so much! A little bit of both actually. Once again the key is Tico. Enjoy! I Did Not Leave South Side For This! Chapter VII - Tico Double English was a pain. It turns out Tico sits directly in front of me. That answered my question as to why there was always an empty seat in class. However I had an excellent view of the board before Tico resumed his normal seat. He kept turning round in his seat to talk to me. Our teacher, Mr Hemming, must have told off Tico at least twenty times throughout those two hours. You would think Tico would condescend to listen to our teacher considering he missed two weeks of school, but it appeared not. I learnt a lot about Tico within those two hours. I can tell you that his favourite colour is green, he likes peaches with cottage cheese, he is obsessed with Britain and wants to study there someday. He has a brother called Rafiki, who is three years older than him but is in the same year as us because of being held back three years. His dad is called Nicolas and his mum is called Suzanne. He tried getting on the basketball team last year but didn\\'t even make the tryouts because he was pigging out on McDonalds. So he applied for the newspaper instead. He\\'s a fucking nerd and is in love with Nico Di Angelo from the Percy Jackson series. He nearly threw a fit when I said I wasn\\'t too keen on Nico, and that I actually preferred Rachel Elizabeth Dare. He didn\\'t talk to me for a good ten minutes. I was pleased about this because it meant I could get some work done. We were learning about Shakespeare\\'s \\'Romeo and Juliet.\\' Let me tell you it is literally the worst play in the world. All I\\'ve learnt about it after weeks of studying it is that Romeo is a horny bastard with a huge sex drive. He is the ultimate fuckboy. I will never understand what Juliet saw in him. If I was Juliet I would just marry Paris to keep everyone happy and then I would kill him if he got on my nerves. Naturally I have his baby first then kill him off because I could take care of all his money until the day my child turned eighteen. Romeo would move on with his life soon enough because he\\'s a horny dude and would go lusting after other females. Juliet was so stupid, oh my god! Back in Shakespeare\\'s time they didn\\'t have DNA tests so I could have quite easily gotten away with murder. Nobody suspects the wife. If I was Shakespeare his plays would have been so much shorter and much more interesting. I was in the middle of ranting about the Crapulets in my paper when Tico turned round to talk to me again. \"Taylor Swift.\" He stated. Although he said her name more like a question than an actual sentence. I put down my pen and lifted my head. I gave him a confused look. \"What about her?\" I frowned. What did this guy want? Tico bore a grin as wide as the Cheshire cat\\'s own. \"I knew that would catch your attention!\" He looked rather smug with himself. My frown deepened. You did not just say my queen\\'s name randomly. Was he about to insulting her? I would not hesitate to give him a piece of my mind if he did. Tico seemed to sense he was treading on thin ice. He answered my question with a nervous smile on his face. \"Thoughts on her?\" I placed my hands on the desk and pulled my chair in, giving him my full attention. My voice went deadly low. \"She is my idol and if so dare to utter a bad word about her I will have your head.\" Tico\\'s warm smile vanished. His eyes widened and he put a hand to his throat subconsciously. It quite comical now that I think about it. My eyes narrowed. I flipped over my paper before continuing to write. There was silence for a few moments before a quiet laugh cut through the air. I glanced up to see Tico giggling away in his seat. I raised my eyebrows. \"What?\" Tico glanced at me and laughed loudly. He earned a stern look from Mr Hemming, which caused him to stifle his giggles. \"I can\\'t believe you got the impression that I hate Taylor Swift! Damn I\\'m a good actor.\" I tipped my head to the side. \"So you don\\'t hate her?\" \"Oh hell no! I could never hate her! She is the next best thing next to Beyoncé!\" Tico exclaimed. He fiddled with a pen in his hands. There was a moment\\'s pause. \"And the backstreet boys.\" Tico added sheepishly. He looked embarrassed to admitting he liked the backstreet boys. I leaned in, edging closer to Tico. \"I want it that way...\" A light of recognition played in his eyes. His grin returned. I almost broke down laughing myself. I managed to keep control and just smiled instead. \"So you\\'re a fellow swiftie?\" I asked. Tico nodded eagerly. \"Been in love with the girl since her first album.\" \"Same!\" \"Favourite song by her?\" I clicked my tongue in thought. \"This is a tough question.\" Tico\\'s grin grew again. If it grew anymore I was worried his face would split in half. \"It has to be Should\\'ve Said No. I love it when the guitar solo hits in. That\\'s the best part!\" \"I know right!\" \"What\\'s your favourite song by Taylor?\" \"Love Story, no doubt.\" He spoke without a moment\\'s hesitation. He must be really passionate about the song if he could pick so quickly, I concluded. \"What do you think of Beyoncé?\" Tico\\'s voice was full of excitement. This was where I deflated his balloon. \"Eh, she\\'s too shouty for me.\" Tico placed a hand on his chest and gasped. He looked so offended. I was trying so hard not to laugh but the look he was giving me was making it really difficult. \"Gurl, you\\'re a beautiful liar, everyone loves the Queen B.\" I lost it. And that\\'s the story of how I got my first detention at East High. When the bell for the end of English sounded I stormed out of the classroom. I had just received my first detention, my clean slate had it\\'s first hole in it. My mother was going to be so mad. My good reputation was ruined. The world was ending. I might as well book my funeral service now and say my goodbyes. I would not be alive to see the next day once my mother was done with me. \"Tia! Tia, wait!\" Tico. My ears pricked up at the sound of my name but I chose to remain oblivious. I was not in the mood to talk to the guy who had just earned me a detention. Round the corner I went. Round the corner to find my locker. Round the corner to get lunch. I was grumpy and hungry. Those two things combined did not make a happy Tia. If anyone dared fuck with me anymore than they already had today then I would seriously consider suing the school. All this musical stuff was causing me trauma and mental scarring. I reached my locker, punched in the code before nearly tearing the door off its hinges. As I was placing my books in my locker I heard my name being called again. \"Tia!\" I continued unloading things as Tico reached me. I tried to pretend he wasn\\'t there, but that was very hard when you could hear his heavy breathing. He must have ran to catch up to me. \"Tia, please. I\\'m sorry.\" I slammed my locker shut and looked at him. \"Sorry is not going to suddenly make everything better, Tico!\" I spat. I glared at him, making him recoil. Then I felt guilty. Tico looked truly apologetic. \"Look I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t mean to get you that detention. Honestly.\" I was miles away as I ferreted through my purse, counting my money. Shit. I was 20 cents short for spaghetti and meatballs. Shit. I was going to have eat mushroom soup instead. I hated mushrooms. Shit. Tico waved a hand in front of my eyes. Apparently I was frozen. I was internally debating the pros and cons of eating mushroom soup. He etched an eyebrow, scanning me over for a moment. \"Are you okay...?\" He reached out to touch me. \"Mushrooms.\" I whispered, staring straight ahead. My soul was crippling internally. Even the word made me cringe. \"Uh... What?\" I gazed at Tico, my eyes wild. \"I don\\'t have enough money for meatballs. I have to eat mushroom soup. I loathe mushrooms.\" Tears started to brim my eyes. Tico\\'s expression changed from one of concern to one of bewilderment. He stepped forward when he heard me whimpering. \"Are you crying?\" I put a hand between myself and Tico. \"Don\\'t look at me!\" I yelled. I felt like The Phantom Of The Opera right now. I just wanted to hide my ugly crying face away from the world. Tico bit his lip. \"Tia, if it bothers you that much I will just buy you lunch. Then will you accept my apology?\" I removed my hand and opened my eyes. I blinked the tears away. I stared at Tico for a good couple of minutes. \"Oh my god yes!\" That trademark grin returned. I swear all Tico was made of was ten thousand smiles. \"Fantastic!\" Tico said. He held out an arm for me. \"Shall we?\" I raised an eyebrow and threw him a questioning look. \"I hope you\\'re not trying to flirt with me.\" Tico threw back his head and laughed. \"Oh darling, I\\'m hella gay.\" Tico had bought me lunch like he had promised. I sat with him and Jess, happily munching away. I was wrapped up in my own little world as Jess and Tico chatted away amongst themselves. I listened to them with a feigned interest. I pitched in my opinion now and again but besides that I was relatively quiet. Jay waved to us as she passed us with Doug, Zachary and Louis. This British exchange student sat with them. Tiara Gold was her name. She was okay from what I had heard of her. However, she was in affiliation with the enemy, I could not be associates with the enemy\\'s comrades. I was about to stuff another forkful of spaghetti in my mouth when I heard music start up. I immediately froze over. My spaghetti was dangling from my fork as I stared in shock. Fuck no. This was the first time I had gotten into the dinner hall in weeks. I just wanted to eat some food in peace without having someone burst into song. Was that too much to ask?! When you attending a school which was a living musical, then yes. Yes it was. \"Imagine having everything we ever dreamed. Don\\'t you want it?\" My ears pricked up the moment it head that voice. Sharpay Evans. I should have known. She sat on the middle table in the canteen. I sat with my friends on the right hand table behind her. I physically facepalmed, earning a few strange looks from my friends. I gestured to Sharpay. Tico nodded in recognition but said nothing. Sharpay pushed Ryan\\'s food away from him. Rude. I mean that was perfectly good food and I would have eaten that if it hadn\\'t of had so many greens. Ugh salad. Ryan sat next to her, trying to reach out for his food. Once it was out of his reach he leaned back and gave a small hand gesture. \"Maybe.\" \"Can\\'t you see it?\" Sharpay gave one of the famous jazzhands, like there was a vision before her. She then turned to her brother. He raised an eyebrow like he was having a hard time picturing it. I couldn\\'t blame him. Becoming famous was a longshot. \"Kinda.\" \"Imagine first audition after college. I get the lead!\" I spat out my drink of orange juice at this point. This was getting ridiculous. I began to choke on my orange juice. Jess thumped me on the back until I was done dying. \"A part for me?\" \"Well of course!\" \"Yeah right!\" \"Same Ryan same. Don\\'t believe your sister or trust her. She\\'s a manipulative little minx.\" I stared at the twins, rubbing my hands together like s mad woman. Jess and Tico shared a look, both concerned for my wellbeing. \"Tia, are you alright?\" Jess asked. She tentatively placed a hand on my shoulder. Tico sipped his water bottle slowly, watching me cautiously. I waved a hand idly. \"Yeah, yeah I\\'m fine. Don\\'t worry about me.\" \"If you say so, champ.\" \"You gotta believe it!\" Sharpay grinned at her brother. She was trying to pull the wool over his eyes. He better not fall for it, I thought. \"Keep talking.\" \"Shit. He fell for it. The cute twin fell for it. We\\'re all doomed!\" I exclaimed and threw my hands in the air. I leaned back, watching the twins intently. Jess frowned. She looked almost amused. \"Wait, you think Ryan is cute?\" I glanced to her, my eyes widened at the realisation of what I had said. \"Yes...?\" My voice was an octave higher than usual and a blush was creeping onto my cheeks. Jess\\' eyes gleamed. \"Oh this is perfect. We just have to get you guys together!\" Jess clasped her hands together and beamed. \"Wait what? No! No way!\" I waved my hands defensively but that did nothing to stop Jess\\' mind from hatching a plan. I rolled my eyes. \"Don\\'t you dare do anything.\" I warned before turning my attention back to the twins. \"Are you literally shitting me?! They\\'re on the table now! The table!\" \"Sound exciting?\" \"Inviting.\" Sharpay clapped her hands. \"Let\\'s do it then.\" \"Listening!\" Ryan sang his reply. He adjusted his hat. I cocked my head slightly to one side. He was rather cute. I was drawn from my thoughts by a light tap on the shoulder. I turned my attention to the person who had hit me. It was Tico. \"Isn\\'t Ryan a dream boat?\" He nodded to the hat boy. \"I\\'ve been admiring since we first came to this school. He\\'s just so yummy.\" Tico licked his lips. I pulled a face. Jess laughed. \"We might have to start calling you thirst, Tico. You\\'re so god damn thirsty all of the time.\" Jess smirked at her friend, punching him playfully in the arm. \"Guys!\" I groaned. \"You\\'re making me miss my brooding i-hate-musicals time!\" I gestured to the twins. I looked down at my food. I had lost my appetite. It was time to put this in the bin. \"Don\\'t you want it all!\" I was suddenly on my feet, aiming to walk away from this musical nightmare and dump my rubbish. I cried out in alarm when my feet automatically moving to Sharpay without my consent. What the heck was happening? Tico and Jess followed me like it was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. Sharpay continued to sing as I continued to walk around her table in a circle pattern. \"You want it, you know that you want it. The fame and the fortune and more.\" I threw my arms in the air in sync with my other friends who had been subjected to this torture. I spun round and sat down. I sang along with Sharpay, smiling all the while. Wait. I was singing and dancing? Holy heck no. I had finally caught the High School Musical disease. There was no going back now. I couldn\\'t fight it. I had to give in.'][Chapter 8] ['AN: Happy 10 Years High School Musical! This series has brought me so much joy and has really helped me out when I\\'ve been in low places. Lots of good things have come from this franchise, such as Tia, who is still in hell. This chapter is only short but it was what I could managed. I haven\\'t updated since October 2015, I feel so guilty! QotD: How has high school musical changed your life? Here is to another decade of High School Musical! — \"You want it all, you want it, you know that you want it. You gotta have your star on the door.\" Sharpay threw her arm in the air and pointed to the sky. I felt like scoffing. Was she serious? That was a cheesy move. However, I was one to talk as my arms quickly followed in suit. I have never been so ashamed of myself. I was freaking out big time. My body and mouth had a mind of their own and my mind was left to rot. And all I could think about was how my meatballs would have gone cold by now. \"You want the world nothing less, all the glam and the press.\" We spun round and began clapping. We were clapping for Ryan Evans. Ryan fucking Evans. I was smiling against my own will, I was too happy. I was trapped in my mind, screaming to get out. The dance fever had reached me at last, it seemed none of us were safe. \"Only giving you the best to use.\" We all sang. I was actually singing. I hated singing, mainly because I had a terrible voice. I was singing against my own will. My other friends were singing too. I heard them but I couldn\\'t tear my eyes away from Ryan to see how they were feeling. I was like a munchkin from the Wizard of Oz, tiny, always singing and annoying cheerful. The question was could I sue anyone for violating my human rights? Sharpay held a hand out to Ryan, helping him down from the table. Sometimes she was so far up her ass I wondered if we would have to send a search party in to find her. \"Sing it!\" A smug look crossed her face. Oh yeah, she knew she owned it and she was flaunting it wildly. I tried to frown or at least mutter something indecent at her, but all my attempts failed. My worst nightmare had come true. I was participating in a musical. The world continued on functioning as normal as Sharpay and Ryan sang their hearts out. We, the unfortunate few, began to spin around on the table. I didn\\'t even know the tables could spin! I was reaching for the stars, like I was the eighth member of S Club or something. Tico was grabbing the air and pulling it back while pushing the table round. He made it look so easy, whereas my movements were jerky and awkward. I wanted to cry. I really hated this. \"I want it all. I want it, I want it, Yeah. My name in lights at Carnage Hall. I want it all!\" I want it all to stop, I thought, internally rolling my eyes. I was in despair. I was fighting a losing battle. I was slowly giving in and falling further from sanity. I was seriously regretting choosing East High over West High at this point in time. Maybe if I had gone to West High then I could have avoided my living hell. Someone, a very sick someone, was getting enjoyment out of my torture. What had I done to deserve this? I had never smashed a mirror as I avoided anything thought to bring bad luck. Again, I was forced to blame magic for my unfortunate circumstances. \"Can\\'t you see it.\" Sharpay was observing her subjects, all of them were sticking to the status quo of East High. I had no clue what the status quo of East High was but I\\'m pretty positive it involved an elaborate musical number somewhere and possibly a guy with a cello? (I don\\'t know, there always are guys with cellos in Disney movies.) Sharpay\\'s voice failed to lack the pompous edge it always had. Was modesty even in this girl\\'s vocabulary? Ryan cheered, his voice filled with awe. \"Yeah!\" Ryan, poor, beautiful Ryan, was so naive. Bless him. He was grinning from ear to ear, gazing far beyond the four walls of the cafeteria. For a moment, he saw his entire future dazzlingly brilliantly in front of him. It was almost within reach. In a few months we would all graduate and he could pursue his passion for the arts. And me? Well I would be heading to a good college on the East Coast to get as far away from this place as possible. Sharpay sighed, building her own version of Ryan\\'s fantasy. \"They\\'re gonna love me!\" Ryan\\'s eyes widened and he glanced to his sister. \"Ahem.\" I felt sorry for him. He deserved better than Sharpay as a sister. That guy needed somebody to love. Sharpay quickly corrected herself and smiled sweetly at her brother like it had been an innocent mistake. \"I mean us!\" My ears did not fail to catch the bitterness lurking behind those words. I was puzzled. Did Sharpay feel like Ryan was holding her back in someway? They were twins, they were meant to always be there for each other. But then, since they were twins I would understand why Sharpay would be slightly resentful towards Ryan. I would hate to share everything too. Thank the Lord I\\'m an only child! Then something completely bizarre happened. The cafeteria changed before my very eyes. My clothes changed too! The cafeteria was completely littered with people. For some reason, a red carpet was before me. The guy who had gave me a muffin once was there. I hadn\\'t seen him in the cafeteria beforehand. He wore a black suit, a pink tie and sunglasses. His friend was in the same attire. I stared at him, completely bewildered by the fact they were wearing sunglasses indoors. The lights had been dimmed, there was no need for them. I glanced to my hand and found I was holding a disposable camera. \"What the..\" Some part of my brain rejoiced. At last my voice had been found! I made to go and put the camera in my jeans\\' pocket but found I had none. My hand met smooth material instead. My eyes widened and I glanced down to what I was wearing. I was in a short purple dress, which had a low cut neckline, revealing way too much. I blinked, startled by the sudden turn of events. Was I tripping or something? Had my coffee been spiked? I had only taken a few sips of it before being commanded to dance by the blonde bimbo and her baby brother. The music started up again and I screamed. \"Red carpet,\" Sharpay\\'s voice came ringing through, loud and clear. My gaze homed in on her. She was stood a few metres away from me. She was dressed in a tight blue dress with a blue puffy shawl to keep her warm. Her hair had been curled and a ton of make up had been slapped onto her face, making hr appear ten years older than she was. There was no denying she looked gorgeous. I wanted to know who Sharpay\\'s stylist was so I could hire them to make me look that hot in the mornings. Ryan trailed behind her. He looked pretty flawless too. Black suited him, he should have worn it more often. Although I would ditch the pink scarf, it really ruined the look. Damn, I really needed their stylist\\'s number. Ryan looked uneasy as he reached my step. This was my chance! I had to get their number! I rushed forward, touching him lightly on the shoulder. His face took on one of disgust. I ignored it. \"Yo dude, wassup?\" I chatted away as we descended the stairs. \"I know we don\\'t talk much but I think you look gorgeous and I need your stylist\\'s number. Do you know if they can work miracles?\" I nearly tripped over Tico as I chased after Ryan. Tico had been fawning over Sharpay before slotting in neatly behind me. I failed to notice his wardrobe change too. In response to my questions, Ryan just put his hands up and hurried away from me. \"I\\'m with her, don\\'t stop me, I\\'m not the paparazzi!\" Um rude. I had complimented him and he just totally rejected me. I made a mental note to only insult him in the future. \"Fight me!\" I yelled, personally offended that he hadn\\'t answered me. I was guessing his stylist couldn\\'t work miracles then. I had challenged Ryan Evans to a duel. He had to accept otherwise I would not hesitate to throw eggs at him everyday until he crumbled. I could be cruel when I wanted to be. I was drawn from my thoughts by the sudden realisation I was near an exit. I could leave this hell. \"Fuck this shit, I\\'m out.\" I put up my hands in surrender. I was going to need some serious therapy after this. I squeezed passed Tico, patting him on the shoulder. \"You\\'re on your own now, boy.\" I liked saying the word boy, it made me sound like some cookoo old timer who had lost all his teeth and does nothing but sit in his rocking chair all day and play the banjo. I aspired to be that man. It only occurs to me now I had weird aspirations. I was almost at the exit when I was hit in the head a giant ball of the Earth. I was caught off guard and fell forward. I yelled in alarm. However, it seemed everyone was too obsessed with the twins to notice me. My hands flew out in front of me, saving me from any lasting damage but I did end up with a few nasty cuts and bruises. My legs stung like hell. I felt like crying. Did the World hate me or something? Apparently it did as the giant globe rolled pass me. I sighed, I was tired of this school. \"Worst day ever.\" I mumbled before burying my head into my arms.'][Chapter 9] ['AN: Have a long chapter! So I heard High School Musical 4 is being made, is anyone reading going to audition for it? I know it\\'s exclusive to America but I\\'m curious to know! When writing this chapter I listened to a lot of Smash Mouth and Jennifer Lopez to get the 2000s vibes throwing. I still can\\'t believe High School Musical was ten years ago! Time goes by so quickly, oh gosh. I hope you enjoy this chapter, guys! \"Tia?! Tia are you alright?\" Louis? Was that Louis? It sounded like Louis It was no use asking me if I was alright if I couldn\\'t even figure out who was talking, dipshit. Louis was a nice guy but he lacked a little common sense sometimes. He was like a confused goat, bless him. Another voice rang out, making me cringe. My head hurt like hell. \"Give her some space people!\" That was definitely Jess, I would know her voice anywhere. When you shared practically every lesson with said friend you learned to identify her voice very quickly. She was easy to find in a lost crowd, all you had to do was listen. She had a loud voice so you could find her within a matter of seconds. I blinked the world into focus, groaning as I did so. \"Ugh,\" I pushed myself up, my head was racing. It felt like someone had gotten a baseball bat and hit my head brutally for the next hour. I wanted to crawl into a dark room and collapse. Fainting was becoming a habit of mine. I should have remembered about the after effects of fainting, headaches and dizziness were included. Sometimes I wondered if I even had a brain for any blood to rush to. Momentarily she closed her eyes, allowing the haziness to clear before opening them again. I placed a hand to my head, forcing all my weight onto my other arm, supporting me off the ground. \"What happened?\" I sounded like I had just woken up from the world\\'s longest slumber and probably looked like it too. My vision came into focus and I saw the concerned faces of my friends staring down at me. They were all there: Jay, Tico, Louis, Doug, Jess and even Zach! I hadn\\'t known where grumpy guys and I had stood on friendship terms, were we acquaintances? Were we friends? Were we frienemies? I could totally dig being frenemies. He could be the Buford to my Baljeet, it would make sense considering I was the smarter one out of the two us. I had no shame in admitting that. I held my hand out, demanding help. Thankfully, Jess answered my distress call. She stepped forward and hauled me up. As I was being pulled up I felt a pair of hands on my back. I glanced over my shoulder, cursing when a haze swarmed my head. Jay smiled at me pitifully. She was supporting my back so I didn\\'t fall back on my shaky legs. My eyes watered, I felt like hugging her. She was so lovely. I blinked away the tears, slightly shocked at my behaviour. How hard had I hit my head in order for me to get this emotional? I needed to listen to some Shakira, that would set my mood straight. Once I was on my feet Jess responded to my question. Jay had my arm linked with mine, she was there for me if I was to suddenly fall. \"You fainted suddenly, you gave us quite the shock.\" Jess checked me over before nodding to herself in satisfaction. By Jessica Wang\\'s standards I was okay. But Jessica Wang\\'s standards of illness were practically non-existent. Doug had once taken the day off school because he was sick, when really we all knew he had a hangover. Jess hadn\\'t let that go for weeks. She had followed him round school calling him a skiver. I had to agree with her, although I was fearful she would break out singing at how Doug was a skiver at any moment. Luckily my sanity had been spared. Tico stared at me quizzically, tipping his head to the side. He smiled a bemuse smile. \"Tia, why were you lying on the floor?\" I took a sharp intake of breath, preparing myself to reply. However, I was cut off by Tico continuing. \"If you were scavenging around for spare food then try behind the bins,\" He pointed to the bins, making me turn my head and follow his hand. He circled an specific area behind the bins with his hand. It was full of rubbish from people who had missed the bin and had been too lazy to pick it up and put it in the bin, myself included. I turned my attention back to him, I must have looked horrified as Tico put his hands up in defence. He took a step back. \"Gurl, would not believe what people can\\'t put in it.\" Zach hit him lightly, shaking his head in disapproval. Tico shrugged. \"At least I never fell in the trash, Zachary.\" Zach turned a bright pink and politely excused himself. I watched him go, one eyebrow raised in surprise. I would have broke down laughing if my head wasn\\'t so clouded. Zach was trash, literal trash. Tico\\'s voice drew my attention away from Zach. \"You sure you weren\\'t after a trash meal?\" I was perplexed to say the least. \"What? No!\" Tico crossed his arms and tutted. He didn\\'t believe me. I quickly changed the subject, this conversation was garbage (see what I did there?) I leaned against Jay for support, I was beginning to feel faint again. \"You must have heard the singing!\" I gushed, studying Tico\\'s face desperately for any indication he had heard something. Nothing, his face was a blank page. \"It was suddenly night and we were all wearing different clothes. I was in a purple dress and you were there too!\" I insisted, trying to break forward but my legs gave way. Before I fell to the floor Jay yanked me back up and Louis rushed in to support my other side. Jay scolded me for my reckless in one simple look. If looks could kill that woman would be the top killer. I coughed, Jay was a sweet thing but boy she could be scary. I think it was because she was short, short people are closer to hell after all. Louis, on the other hand, gave me a reassuring squeeze on my arm. He was a helpful, confused goat, bless him. \"You were in a green jumper and…\" My brows furrowed and I gazed down at the floor, my memory was fuzzy. I pushed myself to remember what had happened next. All I remember was obnoxious singing and the World. I gasped, lifting up my head and staring directly at Tico. \"And I got hit in the head by a fucking blow up globe.\" My day just got a whole lot more interesting. I felt a hand on my shoulder and drew my attention away to see Doug. Louis had removed himself from my arm by now, feeling that I was stable enough to support myself. However, he still hovered nearby, ready to catch me again if I was to go. Doug studied my face, concern in his eyes. I gave him a warm smile in return. \"Tia, I need to ask you a serious question. Are you high right now?\" My face fell, it seemed I was not the only one who thought I was crazy. For some reason I felt myself beginning to tear up. I sniffed. I was not crazy, I just attended a crazy school with even crazier students, that was all. If anything I was the sane one in these organised shenanigans! I should have expected this, nobody believing me that is, I had been in this mad house long enough to know that. Nobody ever believed me, but it still didn\\'t hurt to hope. Zach had rejoined us by now after finding his composure. He was quick to my defence. He drew Doug\\'s attention away from me. \"What the fuck, Doug?\" Zach threw his arms wide, like he was challenging Doug to a fight. I leaned forward, eager to see shit go down. I loved my friends but I was also a sucker for fights. When your father used to make you watch WWE at any given opportunity you gained a thirst for showdowns. \"Everyone knows you\\'re the stoner, not Tia!\" Zach spat, I seethed, that one must have stung. I must have been mumbling \\'Fight! Fight! Fight!\\' under my breath loudly in order for Jay to hear me. She snorted at my assumption. In reality we both know they were too cowardly to really cause any damage to each other. It was still sweet to dream though. Doug gave my shoulder a light squeeze. My buddy got my back. \"Yeah but I remember my first few times and it wasn\\'t easy.\" Doug shot me an easy smile and I couldn\\'t help but return it. Who said all stoners were bad people? Doug was one of the nicest guys I knew! I made a mental note to ask him if he wanted to come over to my house and just binge watch Kim Possible with me, he seemed like the kind of person who loved Kim Possible. Zach threw his hands in the air in exaggeration. \"DOUG!\" He yelled, attracting some unwanted of attention to our group. He met my eyes briefly, shook his head before storming off, muttering curses to himself. I shared a look with Doug, he shrugged. He had no idea what had gotten Zach in a tizz, he had just been joking after all. I chuckled softly, shaking my head as I did so. Zach had a tendency to be melodramatic, I had suggested to him before that he should join the drama club; he had taken one look at me and not spoken to me for a week until I apologised. I found this quite ironic because it just emphasises the fact of how dramatic he is. I felt myself become light headed again and sway about. Doug moved his hand from my shoulder to my arm, steadying me again. I laughed softly, blinking the dizzy world back into focus. \"Wow, boy do I feel lightheaded!\" I remarked, my headache had grown stronger again and that dull ache had transformed into a heavy pounding once more. It was hard to concentrate on my surroundings. The cafeteria light made me wince and all the noise added to my agonising ache. My skull felt like it wanted to open up, it needed to release the tension in my head. I groaned when Louis step forward. He was about to poke his business where it was not wanted and as leader of our little group whatever he said people would agree with. \"Do you need to go home, Tia?\" I closed my eyes and shook my head, trying to clear my mind and block out the aching. The group murmured in agreement, inwardly I groaned. Honestly, home didn\\'t sound like a bad idea. It meant I could escape musical hell for a few extra hours and catch up on some much needed sleep. Yeah, now that I had thought about it, Louis\\' proposal didn\\'t sound half bad. Well done, Louis! \"I\\'m walking you home.\" Tico announced. I was slightly taken back, sure Tico was a friendly guy but we had just meet today! \"I barely know you!\" I cried, backing away from him. He rolled his eyes at my ludicrous manner. He strolled over to me briskly and wrapped his arms around my shoulders. He batted Louis and Jay away before stirring me out of the cafeteria and towards the school\\'s reception. I looked up at Tico, he wore a wicked grin. I began to protest but he shut me up by signing me out of reception and asking the receptionist for my address, knowing full well I wouldn\\'t give it to him. I had no say in this whatsoever. So when we got outside I buried my face in my hands and prayed to every single deity I could have think of. \"Oh Jesus take the wheel.\" The ride to my house had been rocky. I had learnt that Tico was an awful driver and had an even more awful car. It was from the early 90s and seriously needed to die already. Every pothole we went over, I felt. I nearly threw up a good five times. The drive had brought to my attention that the city council did not give a shit about the roads and that whoever had given Tico his licence was a madman. He pulled up on my driveway. He turned to me in hissed and opened his mouth to speak. I cut him off. \"You\\'re not coming into my house.\" I said in a monotone voice. My mind wasn\\'t going to be swayed. Tico pouted and gave me his best puppy dog eyes. He looked like a five year old. \"Aww come on, Tia! Just one peak! I\\'ll be good, I promise!\" He begged, adding a slight whine to his voice to try and make me more lenient. Nope, not working buddy. I mockingly sighed and rolled my eyes. I pretend to think about it, getting Tico\\'s hopes by the tiniest bit. I smirked, crushing his spirits with a shake of my head. His face fell. \"You made me listen to Nickleback all the way home, so no.\" I despised Nickelback, they were just too… ugh… just too Nickelback! \"Pretty please?\" \"No.\" I exited the car, my bag hooked over my shoulder. Now to head to bed and travel to the land of Nod. Tico gasped and put a hand to his head like he was in pain. He was born to be a star, I\\'m telling you. He rolled down his window and stuck his head out it.\"You\\'re cruel to me, Tia!\" He exclaimed. He leaned back in his chair, one hand on the steering wheel. A grin decorated his features and I could pick up the teasing in his voice. I concealed a smile as I walked up the stairs to my porch. I waved over my shoulder without turning around. \"Bye Tico.\" \"I\\'ll be back to pick you up at eight tomorrow!\" Tico yelled from the car. I shook my head, fighting the urge to smile. He was ridiculous. I slammed the door behind me, I had a reputation of a cold hearted bitch to keep up. It was hard work. The moment I walked through the door Mum was badgering me with questions. She didn\\'t ask me why I was home early since school had rung her earlier to let her know why. \"Tia, was that a boy?\" I sucked in a breath, I had forgot Mondays were the days Mum got off early. We were still adjusting to our new lives here, which also meant adjusting to a new schedule. Mum was constantly on my back about whether or not I had a boyfriend and every time I asked I said no. Just because you and Dad were together at my age, Mum, it doesn\\'t mean anything! Everybody is different! She sounded elated at the prospect I might finally be getting my shit together. Well, here\\'s a little known secret, reader, nobody ever has their shit together. I mean just look at my parents. They thought they had their shit together but got divorced when I was three and everything fell apart again. Life was just a really unfair game of snakes and ladders. \"Yes, Mum.\" My mother was practically glowing by this point. Her face was plastered with this enormous, creepy smile she always got whenever I so much looked in a boy\\'s direction. It was weird, man. She clasped her hands together and watched me spring up the stairs, taking two steps at a time. \"Why didn\\'t you invite him in? I would have loved to meet him!\" She called, making me pause. I was halfway up the stairs when her question rang out. I wasn\\'t in the mood for her antics today, I just wanted to sleep for a million years. I gave her a pointed look. \"Mum, he\\'s gay.\" That shut her up. Don\\'t get me wrong, I did love my mother, it was just she had a very dominating personality. It was hard to handle sometimes and I could understand why my parents had split. The marriage was a toxic one and was making them both miserable. My parents still got along swimmingly and I visited Dad every two weeks. I was scheduled to visit him this weekend in fact. Dad always made an effort to attend anything I was in. He was a good Dad. I decided to call Dad before I fell into a deep slumber, I need someone to remind me I was sane. Tico had remained true to his word and had turned up at my house at eight stat. Mum had freaked out when she had seen the car outside. I, on the other hand, had felt breakfast churn in my stomach. I couldn\\'t ride in that thing again. I had asked Mum if I could take her car since she wasn\\'t working today. She had thrown me the keys and told me to stay safe. I wasn\\'t sure if that was a euphemism or what. I liked to think it wasn\\'t. Somehow, I\\'m not even sure how, Tico had managed to get himself invited to tea by my mother. It made sense he would come home with me since his pile of rust was parked outside my house. But to be invited to tea? On Taco Tuesday? That was a big no. I had seen how Tico hoovered up food, I would be saying goodbye to those tacos quicker than I could say Bob\\'s your uncle. Tico, being the moocher he is, he did not hesitate on accepting my mother\\'s offer. And so, begrudgingly, I drove us to school. We listened to some JLo on the way to school, which brightened my mood significantly. Tico singing Jenny From The Block even had me smiling and by the time we reached school we were both in fits of laughter. We had been walking to class when Tico nudged me, causing me to give him a puzzled look. We paused in our walking, just staring at each other for a few moments. Someone shouted for us to \\'get a room.\\' I chuckled softly, knowing fully well that Tico did not swing that way and both of us had no interest in each other beyond friendship. Tico gave a thumbs up to the guy who had shouted the insult. I half smiled, after a rough day yesterday, today was perking up. Tico signalled with his eyes to the roof. My brows furrowed in confusion and I looked up. I nearly screamed from what I saw. Troy Bolton, captain of the Wildcats, constantly conflicted over singing or the ball, was on the roof. I squinted, putting a hand over my eyes to shield them from the sun. \"What the fuck is he doing on the roof? Does he not care about health and safety?\" Tico shook his head and placed a hand on his hip. Like me, he was also an idiot and didn\\'t think to bring a cap to school. I glanced to Tico, \"You know, for someone who is captain of the Wildcats and is one of the school\\'s top singers, he lacks common sense.\" Tico hummed in agreement. I smiled faintly before turning back to stare at the absurdity that was Troy Bolton. \"This has two weeks detention written all over it. Have fun!\" Said someone behind us. I paid little attention to it, Troy Bolton was the current subject of interest not whomever had spoken. Currently, I had a hand under my chin in thought and my elbow was being supported by my other hand. The sun had gone behind some clouds so it meant I didn\\'t have to squint, thank God. \"How\\'d you think he even got up on the roof?\" I turned my attention to Tico for his thoughts. \"I thought that the roof was always locked expected and the only people who had the keys were the gardening club and the janitors.\" I spoke from experience. I had tried to snag a key myself when I had first arrived at East High. I had seen the roof as a place of solitude from all the singing. I had a plan that I would camp up there every breaktime and lunch time for my school year, avoiding everyone and everything. That plan had been abandoned as nearly as it had been thought up when I had heard a musical number coming from the roof. I had decided to seek solace within my friendship group instead. Tico never got to answer me as Gabriella Montez suddenly ran past us. She had a big, coy smile on her face. Her eyes were on Troy. She was heading to the roof. A lump rose in my throat, my nostrils flared and I felt myself panic. I screamed and grabbed Tico\\'s arm, he sent me a bewildered look. My voice was laced with panic as I began to drag him closer to school. \"We gotta go, another musical number is going to break out and I don\\'t want to be around to witness it!\"'][Chapter 10] [\"AN: So it's been a long time since I updated this story!

Summer was finally here ! School was officially over , summer beckoned , full of endless possibilities including writing music and growing would be nice though Kelsi Nielsen highly doubted the latter would happen for her . She was petite and that was that . Fun summer activities aside , Kelsi needed to find a job other than competing with her best friend Martha Cox for babysitting jobs . The town wasn't that big and they all knew the same people which meant most of their friends were also competing for jobs so the composer was genuinely surprised when Sharpay Evans informed her that there was an opening at the Lava Springs Country Club this summer for a pianist . Sharpay being the diva that she was, it came out more as an order but Kelsi considered it as a possibility . She could play the piano all summer . It couldn't hurt to look more into it rather than just take the blonde's word for it that the job opening actually existed . ' Ryan, what's your sisters angle this time ? ' Kelsi turned towards the lockers where Ryan Evans, his spiky blonde hair tucked underneath a cap, his clear blue eyes screwed up in concentration, his clothing was impeccable making him look dashing and handsome as if he had just walked off an old 1940 movie appeared to be working on a yoga breathing technique to calm himself after speaking with Sharpay, no doubt . . Not that she thought about the cuteness of Ryan because that would be crazy especially considering how annoying his arrogance and confidence could really bug her most of the time . . Ryan turned those bright blue eyes on her , his mouth lifting in a friendly smile . ' Oh, you mean the job thing ,' Ryan lifted his shoulders then let them fall ,' there's actually no angle . Our regular pianist quit and Mr. Fulton, he manages the Club for our parents , is looking to hire a new one for the summer season ' Kelsi studied him, suspiciously .' So naturally you thought of me ' Ryan tried to catch her gaze as the tiny composer began pulling things out of her locker to stuff into her oversized bag . They shared locker space since their lockers were next to each others and he had been unsuccessfully trying to crack through that shyness of hers since the spring musical , where they had gotten off on the wrong foot in the theatre . He was after all the co-President of the Drama Club and it had been Kelsi's first musical though to be fair , it was her musical that they had been performing . For someone so shy, the girl could be really stubborn when she wanted to be . ' Yes ,' replied Ryan , without skipping a beat ,' I could have Mr. Fulton call you ' ' Thanks but I am capable of applying for a job myself ' muttered Kelsi stopping to scribble a song verse on a scrap of a old note from Martha ,' but, um, just thanks .' Ugh ! Ryan gave her once last look before heading down the hallway just as a bundle of energy that was known as Martha Cox caught her best friend in a hug . Her red plastic earrings dangled as she moved , a Wildcats gym bag dangling from her hand, and a gleam in her eyes . She followed Kelsi's gaze then quickly realized it followed Ryan Evans . Wasn't that something ? ' Finally it's the end of school ,' sighed Martha, dramatically,' I didn't think it would ever end .' She paused for affect ,' I just managed to have an actual conversation with Jason Cross that didn't involve talk of basketball or homework .' Martha had helped tutor Jason the past semester to get his grades up and developed a bit of a crush on the young man . Jason was completely oblivious to the fact much to her chagrin nor had he picked up on her not so subtle flirting . Kelsi gave her a pointed look .' I thought you'd mastered that when you were tutoring him, Martha . Jason isn't that slow …you should just ask him to go out .' Now the bubbly brunette turned that same look back at Kelsi .' Uh oh, remember last time I attempted that ? It wound up being a group hang out at Chad's house which wasn't exactly what I had in mind ' Kelsi patted her hand in sympathy .' Do you want me to say something to Jason for you ? ' Martha pulled a face .' God , no ! I'll get that boy to crack and find me irrestible before the summer is out , give me time ' Kelsi just laughed .' If you say so ' Martha gave her a little hip bump. ' Speaking of cute guys , what was the end of school locker talk between you and Ryan , Kels? ' Kelsi adjusted the glasses on her face as she shook her newly shortened brown curls as they joined the other students making a run out of the school for their freedom and those endless summer nights . ' It wasn't anything that your thinking so stop ,' muttered Kelsi, good naturally ,' it was more an exchange of information . Apparently that country club that his family owns has an opening for a pianist and Ryan and Sharpay gave the manager my name for the job ' Martha grinned angelic like at her .' It wouldn't be so bad if it was what I was thinking ,' encouraged Martha , knowingly ,' you cant live on music alone , Kelsi , and he's cute .' Kelsi rolled her eyes upwards . ' I have so far besides he's an arrogant rat ' ' A cute one though ' Kelsi gave her a shove .' Don't make me tell Jason that you like him because I so will ' ' Fine but don't lie to me , Kelsi,' countered Martha ,' I know you too well. So you might as well fess up that you find Ryan Evans to be cute ' 'Martha ' ' Okay, okay ,' replied Martha as they headed for the parking lot and their vehicles ,' I'll stop for now . Hmm, I never thought about the swanky country club for job openings maybe I ought to put in my own application ' ' It couldn't hurt ' Neither young woman realized that they wouldn't be the only Wildcats applying to the exclusive Lava Springs Country Club or that the Evans would be so involved in their summer . *********************************Summer ******************* *****8 Kelsi was officially a working member of the Lava Springs staff starting this morning - she would be providing mood music for the members throughout all hours of the day in the dining room as well as playing the ladies luncheon and such things . In her spare time , should she have any, she would be assisting in the kitchen rolling silverware or filling water glasses . Since Martha had gotten hired for the kitchen duty of prepping food , this suited the composer perfectly . They could still hang out while they were working while they enjoyed the paycheck and the two free meals a day . It was a half hour drive from town to Lava Springs, the sky was a glorious blue and the sun was shining at this early morning but the girls felt lighter than they had since school had let out a few days ago. Kelsi and Martha decided carpooling made more sense and today , Kelsi was doing the driving . ' Can you believe the whole gang got hired on by Mr. Fulton ? I didn't know if I should thank Troy for putting in the good word for me or what ,' babbled Martha , excitedly ,' I mean, Troy, Chad , Zeke , myself , and Jason are all working in the kitchen , you're the pianist , Gabi is on lifeguard duty, and even Taylor is like an activity director . Is that some luck or what ? ' Kelsi pushed her frames back on the bridge of her nose .' It's cool but don t you think it is a little suspicious , Martha ? I was under the impression that Ryan and Sharpay are spending their summer here so I cant imagine why they would want all of us there in the first place ' Martha piled her hair into a high ponytail as she slid a narrowed gaze towards her friend . ' Don't be so cynical , Kelsi I highly doubt the Evans twins have any say in the running of the country club ,' dismissed Martha , trying to be positive ,' besides I'll be plating food so not freaking out over having to serve Sharpay or Ryan .' She rifled in her bag for lip-gloss ,' Jason is on dishes ' ' So your planning on bringing romance to the kitchen ? ' ' You bet I do ' Kelsi laughed as she turned into the entry way of Lava Springs Country Club , noting the adobe styled design of the buildings , the expansive golf course to the right and the sprawling tennis courts to the left . She pulled her ancient Jetta behind a Mercedes Benz and other sleek , expensive cars already feeling out of her element . Martha directed her to the sign for the employee parking and was relieved to recognize Troy Bolton's old junk of a truck, Taylor's Saab , and Zeke's jeep as she found a space . Today was orientation and a trial run through their new jobs so both girls had dressed casually in shorts and tank tops and carried bags with them filled with change of clothing . They found their friends already hanging out in a conference room , Troy and Gabriella looking cozy holding hands up front while Taylor seemed to have Chad entranced by whatever it was they were talking about while Zeke and Jason were finishing up their breakfast before the meeting started so Kelsi and Martha called out a greeting before joining them at the table . Martha patted a hair in place as she sat beside Jason who smiled up at her . Looks like Jason wasn't as blind as they suspected , after all . ' Hi ' ' Hey Kelsi, isn't this place awesome ? I saw Sharpay and Ryan drive in behind us ,' informed Zeke , who had a thing for the high strung diva since day one and was constantly trying to catch her attention , to no avail . He however never gave up hope that he could win her over eventually ,' Just think I can to see her one on one everyday ' Kelsi patted his hand , kindly .' I didn't think you were a waiter ' ' Oh, I'm not ,' answered Zeke, easily enough ,' I'll be working next to the chef as a ..sigh , sous chef . It's a dream come true and if I am lucky enough , maybe I can get Sharpay to see me differently in a new element ' ' I hope so, for your sake ' Zeke was a genuine good guy and Kelsi hoped for his sake, Sharpay would be kinder than normal to him . She wasn't a fan of the rich young woman or her brother for that matter , still couldn't fathom what it was that the baker saw in her , but she didn't want to see Zeke get his feelings hurt either . She felt the tiniest bit of uncomfortable being around all of the couples then shook it off . It was silly . They were all her friends and she was happy they were blissfully in love . It didn't mean that she had to be a part of a couple to be happy . Zeke rubbed his hands together .' Magic happens in summer , Kelsi ' ' I thought it was changes ' ' That too ' A colorful printed flyer on the table caught her attention as the musician read about a talent show at the end of summer . Employees were encouraged to participate . A little tingle of anticipation started within her as she glanced sideways at a lovey dovey Troy and Gabriella , the notes of a new love song already forming in her mind . This could be perfect for them ! Kelsi turned the page open, pulled out a pen from her bag, beginning to scribble lyrics as an older man with an air of authority about him and dressed in a dapper looking suit joined them in the room . This was the manager , the seemingly always tense Mr. Fulton . ' Good morning , all ,' addressed Fulton, his eyes moving to follow all of them as he spoke ,' Welcome to Lava Springs Country Club . In front of you, you will find the essential paperwork , you will need to fill out these forms and get them back to me so that we can pay you . ' His gaze swept over Troy momentarily then back to the group,' This is a practicality meeting seeing as I have spoken to each of you individually about what your job entails in detail earlier . You will be expected to act with decorum at all times ' Mr. Fulton adjusted the knot on his pinstriped tie .' Ms. McKessie , you will be expected to dress proper as you will be dealing directly with the guests . This also applies to you, Ms. Nielsen , please leave the funky clothing in your locker , dress classy , if you will ' ' Yes, sir ' ' Um, sure ' She and Taylor share a familiar look - it looked like casual and comfort was out for the job . Kelsi wondered briefly what she had in her closet that was suitable for playing to the upper class as her style tended to be eclectic and boho mixed together . Taylor was more conservative so finding dresses wouldn't be a problem for her . ' Moving on, I am fully aware that you are classmates of the Evans but I must remind you, this is their home away from home , if you may . They will be staying here in the family suite the entire summer and I expect you to serve them without any so called hi-jinks or messiness that might be over from the said school year , is that understood ' ' Can we draw straws to see who waits on them , please ? ' this came from Chad . ' No, you may not , Mr. Dan forth ' continued Fulton , his voice tight ,' this is their club and you will all treat them with respect . If you kids have a problem with this part of the job, then perhaps it isn't the right fit for you ' There were murmurs among the group as none of them were jumping with joy to wait on Ryan and Sharpay but they all needed the money the jobs provided them . Kelsi hoped that she would be safe stuck in the dining room as she fully expected the brother /sister duo to spend all of their summer being waited on hand and foot by the pool . If she was lucky , Kelsi hoped to avoid having to deal with them . ' Tips should you receive any are yours to keep ,' continued the stuffy manager ,' Mrs. Evans whom some of you might meet later is on the board, very involved in the minutia of the running of the club, and is a fair woman . Think nothing of it if she offers suggestions to you at any given time ..' Kelsi wondered if that translated to bossy as both of her kids tended to be . Still she had never met the woman so Kelsi decided she needed to be fair . It didn't matter if she played elevator music to the masses , this was the best job available to her . She could be sopping up spilled milkshake at Hubs rather than playing music getting paid for it . ' Finish your paperwork, turn it into me then feel free to tour the club being mindful of the guests ,' went on Fulton ,' I will expect you all to meet me in the kitchen in the hour where I will have schedules for all of you ' No one had to be told twice . In a matter of moments the important paperwork was finished and turned in then they split up in groups to explore the country club together . The guys filed out together eager to check out the breakfast buffet while plying Fulton with questions of it being included in their meal perks while Kelsi joined Martha , Taylor, and Gabriella , taking their time to note the elegant Southwestern paintings on the walls, the framed pictures of the Evans on another wall, the shelves filled with dozens of Star Dazzle awards and the fine piano tucked into a corner of the dining room . Kelsi itched to test it out .' Nice ' ' Lets go check out the pool 'urged Gabriella , ' since I'll be putting my lifeguard certificate to the test this summer ' ' Lucky you ' A large pool spread out , its water sparkling in the desert sun while members lounged in nearby chairs , soaking it all in along with their chilled iced teas or fancy cocktails . Colorful umbrellas shaded guests from the heat of the sun while Gabi and Taylor separated from them to get a closer look at the spread while Kelsi and Martha immediately noticed Sharpay and her Sharpayettes residing by the pool in their designer bathing suits and three hundred dollar sunglasses . ' I think I'll stick to the park pool ' muttered Kelsi, looking down at her khaki cargo shorts and multi colored tank top as she pulled a face ,' Gabi can have this one ' Before Martha could respond , Ryan stepped between him, a glass tea in his hand, a red fedora propped on his head, and he was looking a bit on the preppy side with colorful jams shorts and a white polo shirt . Noticing Kelsi put an easy going smile on his face . ' Kelsi, good morning ,' said Ryan , trying to ignore the wariness he saw in her eyes ,' you're a sight for sore eyes . Want to join me for breakfast ? I can have another tea sent over ..oh hey Martha ' Martha made a little noise at the back of her throat, amused .' Hey there , Ryan ' Thrown off balance by the playboys attention, the composer took a step backwards , putting a little space between them . She didn't why he caught her off balance but he did . She didn't know why he did because Ryan didn't act this way at school it was odd . ' Uh, no, Ryan , I'm working . We are working so it's probably not a good idea for , um, me to be having breakfast with you on my first day of orientation and all ' Ryan's blue eyes twinkled at that .' I could have a word with Fulton , Kelsi, make sure there isn't a problem for you .' Her temper lit up. ' I don't need for you to make any exceptions at all for me, Ryan Evans , ' countered Kelsi, her ire rising on a spark of fire ,' I am sure there are plenty of pretty guests here that would just love to have breakfast with you. I am not one of them ' She shoved impatiently at her glasses .' I need to go get my schedule ' Ryan spread his palms open, confused. ' What did I say wrong , Kelsi ? ' Kelsi didn't hear him, she was already power walking back inside pretending to ignore him but didn't she look adorable ? Ryan thought that she was much prettier than most of the girls that were members of the club and Kelsi challenged him . Martha laid a hand on his sleeve , sympathetic .' That's more actual flirting than I've actually seen you doing all year at school so one thing, Ryan, if your honest to God interested in Kelsi, you have to do better than that .' Leaving Ryan with that nugget of sage advice , Martha hightailed it back inside the club , leaving him pondering the truth behind the breakfast invite and wondering if his intrest in Kelsi Nielsen was on a romantic level . Could it be true ? ' .\"][Chapter 2] [\"Disclaimer : I still don't own High School Musical , just playing in New Mexico . There would be no sleeping in for those working at Lava Springs this summer which gave Kelsi a little pang of regret as she clocked in at the time clock in the kitchen , called out greetings to her friends who were already preparing breakfast for the guests, as she made her way to the piano in the dining room . Mr. Fulton was a stickler for rules and had already lectured them all on what was expected of them which was quite scary . She would be playing the ladies luncheon this afternoon and had settled on a short sleeved white eyelet tunic top paired with a pair of red cargo pants and white Keds . A pinstriped cap completed the picture .. It might not be funky but she looked nice . Not stuffy . She slid her bag at her feet on the floor as Kelsi began playing a medley of easy going pieces that hopefully wouldn't bore the members to sleep . Kelsi had honestly been surprised that she hadn't received a play list since it appeared that the Evans lorded over everyone at this fancy club from wardrobe to iced tea . . Spotting Chad waiting on tables already , Kelsi caught his eye and mouthed a hello even as she noticed Taylor, looking cute and crisp in a red shirtdress , clipboard in hand , strode across the lobby to meet and greet the members in her group . Idly , Kelsi wondered if Martha was making any headway with Jason since they were working side by side in the kitchen . She still couldn't get over how her bold friend couldn't just tell Jason how she felt about him - Martha didn't have a shy bone in her body and Jason could certainly flirt with the best of them . Lost in her thoughts and playing naturally , Kelsi lifted her gaze upwards to find Ryan Evans waving a white napkin in front of her , a sheepish grin across his face as he approached the piano . . She had looked so serious and well, pretty that Ryan had just watched her for a minute . ' Peace ,' replied Ryan , leaning against the piano ,' I come in peace ' Kelsi spluttered a semi laugh .' For what , Ryan ? ' Ryan dropped the napkin , leaned against the piano to study her more carefully .Her eyes were bright and sharp behind the wire rimmed frames that suited her lovely features . ' I'm not really sure but its for whatever I said or did the other day that made you mad at me , Kelsi ,' continued Ryan , lifting his shoulders then dropping them ,' I'm sorry . I..I didn't mean anything bad , I was happy to see a friendly face ' Kelsi paused her fingers on the keys to stare suspiciously up at him .' That is what I don't understand at all, Ryan ,' says Kelsi , biting down on her bottom lip,' sure, we've got classes together , we're in Drama together , and even our lockers are beside each others yet you've always treated me like I am less than a person .' She resumed her playing .' Your nearly as rude to me as your sister when I haven't been anything but nice to you, Ryan Evans ' If she slipped into the swelling crescendo of the Gone With the Wind theme, so be it . It wasn't the worst thing that people could eat their breakfast too and it felt pretty darn good to tell Ryan how she felt about things once and for all . Ryan was taken aback , his expression fell as those clear baby blue eyes stared into her eyes forcing Kelsi to concentrate on the sheet music that was in front of her instead of him. He didn't need to know that she didn't actually need it, she knew it by heart . ' Ah, well, I'm really sorry about that, Kelsi,' Ryan removed his own hat, ran a hand through his blonde hair messing it up, feeling contrite for his behavior ,' I get carried away sometimes which isn't an excuse , its lame . I am sorry for being a jerk to you ' Something inside of Kelsi loosened slightly from his apology . She hadn't realized that it had actually bothered her this much until she had blurted it all out and felt relief . After all it wasn't as if she and Ryan were close friends or even ran in the same circles - Ryan followed along after his sister and she hung with Martha and the others . She managed a shy smile in return .' It's pretty late coming but thanks , Ryan ' ' You really are an amazing composer …' ' You don't have to sweet talk me , I accept your apology ' ' I wasn't ,' corrected Ryan , leaning in to look at her ,' you could learn to take a compliment . ' He couldn't help noticing the way she blushed at the praise and found it slightly adorable ,' I am happy that you got the job here …not that I doubted you would ' ' Well it was either playing here or attempting waitressing at Hubs ,' informed Kelsi with a laugh ,' I am such a klutz so it saved me from spilling milkshake all over myself and customers ' She slid into some easy listening classics , hands deft on the keys of the baby grand . ' I hope Mr. Fulton doesn't have me pitch hit serving food because I will be fired for sure for my lack of gracefulness ' ' I think your safe from that happening ' ' I hope so ,' answered Kelsi , noticing an overdressed Sharpay enter the dining room ,' you know, Ryan, I don't want to keep you from your breakfast or anything .' ' You wanna join me ? ' ' Ummm,' Kelsi wasn't sure about this new feeling that seemed to be awakening within herself and needed to think about it some ,' I'm working here , Ryan , and I don't think Mr. Fulton will like it if I have breakfast with a member or pay me for it ' Ryan tried not to let his disappointment show through .' We uh, own the club but if your worried , I can speak with Fulton so it wont be a problem for you ' ' You don't have to do that …' Why was this conversation so weird ? Why did it feel so different ? They had known each other since kindergarten , after all, and yet something had changed . ' Ryan, there you are ,' demanded Sharpay , dressed for the day in a hot pink designer tennis dress , hands splayed on her hips as she addressed her brother ,' stop wasting time and fooling around ! The girls are meeting us poolside to discuss the talent show over smoothies and you're here , what, chatting with Kelsi ' Ryan tensed at the tone of his twins voice and he tried to tamp down his embarrassment though Kelsi didn't seem to be paying much attention to them . She was probably used to his sisters diva fits from school and theatre but it still humiliated him , nonetheless. ' Good morning to you too, Sis ,' managed Ryan, through gritted teeth ,' I'm not in the mood for a smoothie but you go on ahead . I'll see you later ' Sharpay narrowed her eyes at her brother , annoyance in them .' The talent show is our number one priority , Ryan , and winning , of course ' As if remembering that she was present , the blonde haired diva flicked a tiny glance in the pianist direction , her manner smug . ' Kelsi, you will need to be available for my rehearsals ,' informed Sharpay, casually ,' I'll have my brother or Fulton arrange it . Try to work on something smashing for me, will you ' Not giving Kelsi time to answer , Sharpay bustled through the dining room as if she owned the place as the composer began playing 'In the Good Ole Summertime ' hoping it would lift her mood . Upon hearing of the talent show , Kelsi had been inspired and was already in the midst of writing a new duet with hopes of talking Troy and Gabriella into singing it together , of course . The staff could participate in the summer talent show and the wheels in her head were already spinning with ideas to include all of her friends . She supposed this being on call to accompany Sharpay was the downside of working at the Lava Springs Country club . She just couldn't win ! ' I, uh, gonna grab a bagel and some coffee ,' muttered Ryan , the mood dampened now thanks to his demanding sister ,' then I'd better go see what she wants .' ' Okay , well, I guess I'll see you later ' says Kelsi, sending him a sympathetic smile ,' Ryan, just a thought , its your summer , too ' ' I know ' From the doorway of the oversized kitchen , Martha watched the exchange between her best friend and the dancer with more than a little bit of curiosity. Had Ryan sought out Kelsi first thing this morning ? Did Kelsi still have the chip on her shoulder about Ryan Evans ego ? She wanted these answers and more but work beckoned her instead, dang it . ' Chad ,' Martha caught Chad's sleeve as he reentered the kitchen ,' what's the scoop ? Did you happen to overhear Kelsi and Ryan by any chance ? ' Chad rolled his eyes at the energetic girl .' I have no idea ,' answered Chad , ' but I do need Eggs Benedict and a fruit cup with no green fruits in it ' ' On it ' this came from Zeke, who was working as a Sous chef . Jason took out a large pan of muffins out of the oven at the request of the chef and Zeke then stared blankly at them . Not only was he on dishes but food prep as well which really wasn't his thing un less it was eating the food . ' Hey Martha , do we like put these muffins on plates or in this fancy basket ? ' Martha moved back into the kitchen and joined the cute basketball player .' We had a memo on that from Mrs. Evans this morning ,' explained Martha , as she added a snowy white napkin inside the basket ,' these and the scones are to be served at her ladies luncheon this afternoon so baskets . I think Zeke is making the scones now ' Jason sighed .' We should probably let them cool down first ' Martha grinned at him .' Give them a few minutes ,' replied Martha , pushing the white hat she wore further up on her head with a slight groan ,' so, Jason , I noticed that we both have the same lunch break so I was thinking we could eat together ' ' Oh sure ,' said an oblivious Jason , ' you, me, and Zeke can have lunch together . Does Kelsi have a later lunch too ? ' ' Yeah ,' sighed Martha , chewing on the inside of her cheek ,' but I was hoping just you and I could have lunch together , Jason .Not with everyone we know .' Jason popped a muffin out of the tin then looked at her , brown eyes going wide as he caught her implication . Martha was a great girl with such a fun personality and also one of the smartest girls at East High so he was trying to wrap his brain around the whole idea of her asking him out on a date . Was it a date ? ' Just us ? Like a lunch date ? ' ' That was the general idea, Jason, unless you don't want too ' Martha went to work quickly filling the basket nervously awaiting his response ,' which in that case then sure , Zeke can join us . The more the merrier , gangs all here, and all that jazz ' Zeke passed by to hand a plate of food to Chad and nodded at Jason .' He hasn't had his six Mountain Dews yet, Martha , cut him some slack .' ' I had two this morning on the way in,' countered Jason of his caffeine fondness ,' and I don't need you answering for me, man .' He smiled warmly at Martha ,' Lunch date is on , Martha ' ' Cool ' Just then Mr. Fulton did a walk through stopping to appraise the teenagers with a critical look on his all too serious face . Chad sprinted off to deliver breakfast, Zeke scurried back to his position as Martha and Jason shared guilty expressions . ' Oh goody ! That will be enough flirting for now as the buffet is running low on fruit so chop, chop , Miss. Cox and Mr. Cross why don't you go refill the bagels ' Fun time was over . It was back to work . . *******************************Summer ******************************** Ryan was bored . He sat at a table beneath the shaded umbrella nursing a French soda while Sharpay plotted with her summer Sharpayettes about costumes, tempos , and how she could capture Troy Bolton's attention away from his girlfriend . Ryan was trying to doing his best to tune them out which was nearly impossible . . All around them , other members enjoyed all of the activities the club offered such as water aerobics which Gabriella was leading them into while Taylor was herding a group of little kids around the pool pausing to speak to her best friend . He was supposed to be getting intel by hanging with Troy and the others in the kitchen but Ryan didn't see how he could manage that without them thinking something was up. It wasn't as if he hung out with the guys at school or anything , they maybe tolerated him , and Troy was working . Not to mention he doubted any of their classmates would believe he liked to hang out with the help in the kitchen during his vacation . Sometimes his twin just didn't think things through all of the way - probably like half the time he would say . Glancing up at Gabriella , Ryan couldn't help but to think that Shar making a play for Troy was just plain mean and stupid . Troy Bolton was as devoted to Gabriella Montez as she was to him and Sharpay interfering in their relationship wouldn't be good , any way that you looked at it . Ryan hated to even contribute to it as Gabriella had always been extremely nice to him even offering to help him out so he wouldn't flunk math . Gabi noticed him watching , hollered ,' Hi Ryan , want to join in ? ' Water aerobics with a bunch of Senior citizens ? Gabriella would probably make it fun but it didn't appeal to him this morning . ' Naw but thanks ' Ryan supposed that he could do a solo run through of his part in their Huma Huma number while his sister gossiped or schemed . It'd be nice to steal the show from his sister for a change and the theatrical number was old school cheesy fun worthy of a 1930's musical complete with an exploding volcano and sound affects . It might not be rocking choreography but it was a fun number . . Ryan sighed as he took another sip of his drink . He usually enjoyed his summer spent with the family at the club , his mother had redecorated his room in the family suite , and the weather was sunny and perfect . Jackie , the sun streaked blonde beauty from down south , who vacationed at the club every summer with her parents , and was part of Sharpay's little fan club , had suggested that she could use his company during his stay. The invitation was good because Jackie was very hot looking but pretty shallow . It might get awfully tiring trying to come up with a dozen of compliments everyday and a guy could only discuss nail polish shades for a few minutes before wanting to bolt . Ryan supposed he could always play tennis or do yoga to calm his center . He had been looking forward to summer for so long now that it was finally here , it dawned on Ryan that he didn't have many friends to spend it with . He was all alone . .\"][Chapter 3] [\"Disclaimer : I still don't own anything HSM or Fame . Being the pianist at the country club wasn't as bad as Kelsi imagined it would be and she was actually enjoying it . So far she hadn't been sent to the kitchen to help her friends fold napkins and silverware although her breaks didn't fall at the same time as any of her friends which kind of sucked . She mostly saw them in the morning and in passing . She reminded herself this was her job , not socializing with her friends . She also didn't have one set lunch hour as hers revolved around the ladies luncheon and the mid-afternoon lunch crowd who expected to be entertained while they ate and today was no exception . Kelsi noticed a lull in the late afternoon then decided to take her lunch outside and enjoy the sunshine . Kelsi spotted Gabriella on her perch near the pool on lifeguard duty as she lifted her hand in a wave . Gabi waved back before jumping back into the pool to break up some horse play by a couple of bored middle schoolers . According to Martha who saw and heard everything while she was working in the kitchen , Sharpay was scheming to sink her manicured fingernails into Troy causing a bit of drama for Troy and Gabi right off the bat . . Kelsi had faith that her friends relationship could handle whatever the diva threw at them . Troy and Gabriella were perfect for one another .. As Kelsi scanned the patio for a quiet spot to sit and eat, her gaze fell upon Ryan who was sitting at a corner table staring at his ham and cheese as if the sandwich held all of life's answers . He looked as if the weight of the world was on his shoulders and she couldn't help but wonder about the cause of his stress . Despite their silly lunch arguments from the last week, Kelsi found herself walking across the patio to him . She tugged absently at her blue bag on her shoulder then smoothed her lips into a friendly smile for him . . ' Hi Ryan ' Ryan turned his clear blue eyes upon her , surprised .' Kelsi, hi ' ' I know we debated the whole work and member lunch thing but I really don't want to eat by myself ,' drawled Kelsi, tentatively ,' can I join you ? ' Ryan's mouth spread into a grin .' Please do ..I mean, I'd like the company ' Kelsi slid onto the bench across from him, placing her bottled iced tea on the table then began pulling out her own sandwich and chips from her bag . They got two free meals each day for working here but she proffered to take hers for breakfast or supper . ' Thanks ' She munched on a chip and felt his eyes upon hers . ' I met your Mom at her luncheon the other day , Ryan . She was really very nice and made a point to introduce herself to me ' It had been surprising and Derby Evans hadn't been snobby at all . She'd been warm and friendly and real. Kelsi wondered if Ryan took after his Mom because if she put his inflated ego aside , Ryan wasn't a total bad guy . He was much nicer than his twin , if truth be told . ' Mom was glad to see your talents utilized and not in the kitchen ,' rambled Ryan, stumbling over his words ,' I mean, she heard you play during the spring musical and all ' Gah ! That was such a lame thing to say - you'd think they had never had a conversation together before or maybe it was different outside of East High School .All he knew was that he seemed to be hyper aware of Kelsi Nielsen and his palms were sweating . As a performer Ryan liked to believe that he didn't sweat but yup, he was sweating . Kelsi pushed her glasses up on the bridge of her nose .' I expected to play easy listening classics for the luncheon so I was so shocked when your Mom suggested that I play popular rock hits from the 1980's instead of Bach ' Ryan met her gaze and they shared a smile .' Mom wanted to be a Valley Girl or so she has always told me . Did the ladies rock out with you then , Kelsi ? ' Kelsi took a sip of tea , relaxing .' I thought some of them might ' They grew quiet for a few minutes eating their lunch and enjoying each others company pausing occasionally to make small talk about the pool siders around them or the benefits of Lava Springs itself . . It was nice . Kelsi removed her cap, taking a moment to run her hands through the short brown curls and question her reasoning for cutting her hair in the first place .She had needed a change so she had chopped her hair short now not so much . Maybe she needed to let it grow back out though she liked the curls . Ryan just stared at her , the simple movement of her hand so graceful, the sunlight on her hair making him notice how rich the brown was , not quite chestnut but more of a walnut color . Now he was freaking getting poetic about her hair ! He wasn't particularly a poetic guy in the first place but that thought might have bordered on being poem-like . ' What is it , Ryan ? Is my hair frizzy or something ? I was running late this morning so I didn't have time to blow dry my hair this morning …is it bad ? I am going to kill Martha for not telling me ..' ' No, none of that at all . The curls really suit you , Kelsi ' Color rose to Kelsi's face and she felt herself blushing .' Um, thanks , but Ryan, you know ow , I've had these curls since last fall so not a new hairstyle ' ' I know but your usually hiding behind your piano, Kelsi, ' countered Ryan, flirting with her ,' or can you not take a compliment from me ? ' Ryan didn't know why he was challenging her but he couldn't seem to help himself either .anymore than he could help noticing how sharp Kelsi was behind the frames of her glasses or that she was a very pretty young woman . She wasn't a striking beauty like Gabriella but with Kelsi, it was subtle and pretty . Kelsi was taken back , lowering her lashes .' Are you trying to charm me, Ryan ? ' His grin was unbelievably boyish .' Only if its working ' Kelsi wasn't used to such blatant flirting , let out by the charming Ryan Evans and wasn't sure how to take it . She thought he was cute , yes, but she didn't want to be just something fun for the summer . That just wasn't her and she knew that she certainly didn't fit into the type of girls that Ryan usually went out with either . . ' Hmm, I thought you were seeing Alicia or was it Jackie ? ' She motioned towards the pretty ash blonde young woman in the designer bikini lounging on the right side of Sharpay .She was one of his sisters little wannabes . ' Alicia and I went out for like a week last year so I don't think it really counts as dating ,' Ryan tried to explain ,' we have nothing in common ' Kelsi arched a brow .' Thanks for the compliment and the company, Ryan, but I need to get back to work ' She collected her trash to throw away and was just standing to leave when Ryan reached across the table, touching her hand as if to ask her to stay . A tingle of awareness coursed through them both , a surge of electricity skittering up and down Kelsi's arm . ' I can , uh, get all this , Kelsi , no problem at all . ' stammered Ryan, under his breath . Kelsi drew her hand away from his as if his touch burned her . ' Thanks , Ryan , um, I guess I'll talk to you later ' Ryan gave a casual wave .' I'd like that ' Smiling , Kelsi walked back inside the country club as Ryan began collecting their trash until a shadow fell over him . Hand on hip, her Prada sunglasses shoved up on top of her head, Ryan could practically feel the annoyance wafting from his sister without looking up . ' Kelsi Nielsen ? Really, Ryan ? You could do much better with one of my girls ,' declared Sharpay , cocking her head towards her fan club ,' and we run in the same social circles which you know after that debacle last year is so important ' Ryan bit back a retort , not wanting to waste his breath on arguing with his sister .Sharpay was even more at her element here at Lava Springs and used the power of their name to take advantage of the staff . He never felt right about it himself. He'd tried the whole power vibe a little last year and felt like nobody liked him . It wasn't a good feeling for a confident guy . ' I don't need you to fix me up on dates, Sis ' ' Well, you have horrible taste ,' informed Sharpay, examining her manicure for chips ,' and you take too long to act upon anything unlike myself . I already have Troy looking my way and its only been a week but that wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about ' Ryan fixed her with a look of his own .' I told you that I am not harassing Troy and the guys in the kitchen while they work to get information for you . I draw the line there …not crossing it .' Sharpay growled at him.' Its not as if you have anything better to do , Ryan , and making puppy dogs eyes at little Gabriella Montez is just pathetic ' Ryan straightened to his full height , insulted at the assumption .' Now wait a damn minute, Shar, I am not making anything at Gabriella . I respect that she has a boyfriend unlike you with your plotting and scheming after Troy Bolton ' Sharpay leaned in closer , not wanting to draw an audience and lowered her voice so that only her brother could hear what she was about to say . This new attitude of his wasn't working for it and she didn't much care for it . They were twins and he was supposed to have her back . Be at her beck and call was also a brotherly perk . ' Fine but unless you want to be a shadow this summer , I suggest that you continue with my original plan since the damned Wildcats invaded our beloved club,' hissed Sharpay, her tone not quite menacing but with purpose ,' If you want to spend time with Kelsi then it might as well work for me . You keep tabs on her and report back to me if she gets inspired or something for the summer talent show ..my talent show ' Ryan tensed at the idea .' I do not want to spy on Kelsi ' ' Well if you want to , I don't know, romance her ideas away from her then go for it ,' continued Sharpay ,' then report back to me so I know where I stand on winning ' ' That's even worse , Sis ! ' ' Just do what your told, Ryan ! Toodles ! ' declared Sharpay, breezily as she strolled back to her chaise lounge just as Chad appeared with her glass of lemonade . The basketball player looked about excited at the prospect as Ryan did with his own choices . Ryan didn't really want to spy on the girl that he liked but he'd never really not did as his sister directed before either . He might have not been totally on board with all of her ideas but Ryan pretty much followed her lead . Did that make him a wimp ? He wasn't some brainless dude with air between his ears, Ryan had thoughts and opinions of his own , even if he didn't always speak up . Before Ryan could continue his personal dissection of himself, he noticed a pained expression on Chad's face as he strode towards the kitchen, tray tucked under his arm, muttering under his breath . ' Too much ice …not enough lemon. ! Bossy witch ' Ryan heaved a heavy hearted sigh . ' True that , Chad , that is the truth .' ************************Summer ********************************** The commercial kitchen was a buzz of activity as the dinner rush would soon be upon them , while the chef and the assorted sous chefs prepped salads , diced fresh vegetables, hand cut aged steaks in anticipation that they were catering to the entire Evans family dining this evening besides the other guests, it best they prepare for the onslaught . . Zeke had been sent to the corner to master the art of chocolate mousse while Martha and Jason were filling a cart with the fine crystal goblets to set on the tables in the dining room . They had already made one round with the tables much to their dismay as the dining room was rather large .It was a tedious chore . ' I hope we get tips ,' grumbled Chad , striding back inside the kitchen having changed clothes into the slacks , button down shirt, and vest of a waiter ,' and I don't mean the kind Sharpay has been giving me ' Troy clamped a hand on his shoulder .' Chill, man, think of the extra money . Mrs. Hoffman gave me five bucks this afternoon for refilling her iced tea ' Chad gave his best friend a withering look .' You would get all the good tippers, man ' Troy chuckled and jabbed him in the arm. ' We both will tonight . Be cool ' Jason brushed absently at his brown hair and lifted his hands from the rolling cart to stop beside the guys and prolong the inventible of setting the tables . . ' Hey guys , want to help me and Martha finish up the tables ? This job is almost as boring as washing dishes and you have to be really careful with the glasses ' He made a face in disdain .' I already dropped two and I cant afford to have Fulton dock my pay for any more . This sucks ' ' You have to pay for them out of your pay ? ' ' Ouch ! ' Martha squeezed Jason's hand . ' You just hand me the glasses and I'll do the rest, Jase ' Jason sent Martha a warm look .' You're the greatest, Martha ' Martha beamed ,' Let's go ' As they went out into the dining room , Taylor swept into the kitchen with her clipboard and a list . She slid her gaze to Martha and Jason then to her boyfriend and his best friend in a knowing way . . ' I detect something new there . Did Jason finally get a clue ? That girl spent all last year tutoring the boy and flirting with him and nada, nothing , not a dang clue ' Zeke lifted his gaze from his technique with the chocolate .' Jason's slow but its all cool. He likes Martha back but think he didn't want to step on any toes because Martha and Kelsi are best friends ' All heads swiveled to the baker .' What does Kelsi have to do with those two dating ? ' Zeke held up a hand as he took the chocolate off the burner .' Because Jason and Kelsi went out after the big game last year ' Taylor rolled her eyes. Men knew nothing . ' It was one date that also went no where ,' stressed Taylor feeling the need to break it down to simpler terms for them,' Jason is more than free to date Martha as I am sure Kelsi would tell you if someone bothered to ask her . ' ' Well doesn't matter because Jason is seeing Martha now ' ' So long as it doesn't interfere with their work ,' declared Mr. Fulton, adjusting his pinstriped tie ,' Mr. and Mrs. Evans will have two extra guests at their table so see that extra special attention is paid to their needs , Dan forth .' Chad gulped,' Yes, Sir ' ' Ms. McKessie , what brings you into the kitchen ? ' Taylor pulled out a sheath of papers .' I was just bringing the chef special dietary requests by some of the members -and what they wished for tonight's meal ' ' Very well then ,' Fulton turned to leave,' Good job, Ms. McKessie ' Once he was out of the room, everyone visibly relaxed as the high strung manager could be positively horrifying and down right scary as they had already discovered through no fault of their own . It was if the manager was just waiting for them to make mistakes . Taylor let out a long sigh of relief . ' That man is a walking ulcer ' ' Well he does take orders from the Evans ' ' Taylor,' Chad snaked a possessive arm around her waist bringing her to him ,' I get a break in two hours , want to meet ? ' ' I've got to check in with the front desk to see what else I have to attend to but I can make the time work for us . I'd love to, Chad ' Taylor pecked him on the cheek then in her smooth manner turned and left the kitchen . Troy narrowed his eyes at his brother .' Don't let Fulton catch you and Taylor ' ' The man cant fire us for taking our break together ' Troy and Gabriella had already been caught picnicking on the golf course by Fulton and been warned about the three strike deal. Better that they all be safe . ' Don't be so sure of that , man ' ************************Summer *************************************** The family suite was the home away from home for the Evans family complete with a separate wing for Vance and Derby while Sharpay and Ryan's rooms were adjoining along with private baths . Derby had recently redecorated the living spaces opening the rooms up to make them more comfortable for the family . One of Vance's buddies from the U of A and his wife would be dining with them this evening and Ryan wasn't thrilled . His father had been back and forth the country on business trips for a month now and his returning to New Mexico and Lava Springs meant a chance to spend time together as a family . Though it appeared that his sister intended to monopolize all of their fathers time which really shouldn't have surprised Ryan any, after all, Sharpay was still Daddy's Little Princess . ' I'm not bitter , nope ' Derby knocked lightly on the doorframe before sliding into the room, her short blonde hair swept off her face, looking elegant in a one shouldered white dress and heels , took note of her son sitting on the sofa staring mindlessly at an old musical on the TV . ' Duckie, don't you look handsome ' Ryan had donned a pair of white linen slacks , and a dark blue button down shirt with a matching cap worn sideways simply to bug his father . Small rebellion on his part . Ryan managed a small smile. ' Thanks , Mom ' ' Your sister has invited a young man to join us for supper tonight ,' brought up Derby , hinting directly ,' perhaps there is someone you might like as your guest ? ' Ryan instantly thought of Kelsi .' Mom ' ' Now Ryan there are several pretty young women at the club that I am sure would be delighted to spend time with you ' ' I don't need for you to play matchmaker for me , Mom,' answered Ryan, truthfully ,' I can get a date if I wanted to ..the thing is I just sort of realized I like someone but I need to think about it . Think it through before I make a move ' Derby kissed his cheek .' Just don't over think it too much, Ryan ' Ryan knew that he just needed to take a leap and a chance at romance . . .\"][Chapter 4] [\"Disclaimer : I still don't own HSM or Fame . Dinner at the club consisted of entertaining Vance Evans business partner and wife , exchanging witty stories of the past, as well as listening to Sharpay in full on Daddy's Girl mode making Ryan feeling very, very bored . It was also weird to have Chad serve him his dinner . He could only listen to his Dad's old college stories for so long before he felt like making his escape which Ryan couldn't unless he wanted to embarrass his father . That wouldn't go over well with either of his parents which meant he was basically stuck at this damn table . Ryan sipped at his French soda allowing his eyes to wonder to the baby grand piano where Kelsi played a medley of easy listening songs but judging by the expression on her pretty face, Ryan figured she must be as bored as he was at this moment . He did happen to notice that Kelsi had changed out of her outfit from earlier into more dressy outfit , a short dark blue wrap around dress paired with black and white flats. A patterned scarf was tied around her short walnut colored curls and he found himself immediately drawn to her . Had Kelsi always been this pretty or had he been just blind to her ? He had been sort of self involved in the theatre and in making sure that he passed his math class last year , not to mention helping his sister with her machinations . Shar was his big sister, his twin, and he had always looked up to her but lately , everything felt as if it were changing . As if he was in need of a change for himself but then he thought of the Star Dazzle Awards bringing on his own longing to win one for his own talent . He and Sharpay had revised the very old Huma Huma mermaid number with flash and extra ooomp to make it more current than the old 1930's movie that they had taken it from in the first place . It was a fun, cheeky dance number even though he was once again playing second fiddle to his sister . Not to mention a prince – maybe they should start creating new material more suitable to siblings than what they were using . That might be about as unlikely as convincing Sharpay that she didn't need the key amped up on every single song she wanted to sing . ' Ryan, you are awfully quiet ,' spoke up Derby astute enough to notice that her sons attention was focused on the lovely pianist which was quite new ,' is your soda not to your liking ? ' ' Ah, no, it's fine ,' said Ryan, coming out of his reverie ,' I was just thinking how we should set out a tip jar for Kelsi because she's been playing for what, two hours now ? I know it's not really a socially acceptable thing but it's no different when guests tip waiters and the pool staff ' Derby laid a hand on his arm as she considered his idea .' This is true . She played nearly all of the requests at my luncheon the other day and should be rewarded for her talent. I'll speak to her myself after dinner is over then I will have Mr .Fulton arrange to have a glass put out for her for such things ' Ryan gave her a pleased smile .' Great , Mom .' ' Good business sense , Duckie ,' clucked Derby, turning her attention back to her husband and the topic at hand ,' your Father will be proud of you' Ryan had his doubts on his Dads thoughts on him but didn't want to argue the point . He also wondered if he could escape this incredibly dull dinner and make his way to the piano to speak with Kelsi . He felt as if they had some break through so that she couldn't possibly be angry at him if he spoke with her while she was working now . He didn't want to take this chance right now but as it happened Mr. Fulton paused at their table to check in with them and Ryan gestured to speak with him while wine was debated by the adults at the table . This could go on and on . 'Yes, Mr. Evans , how may I help you ? ' ' I would like a glass of iced tea sent to Kelsi right away ,' replied Ryan in low tones ,' she's been playing for hours and must be thirsty . I, uh, could deliver it to her myself …' More teenage romance but this was surprising with Mr. Ryan who had always appeared aloof and disinterested in the flirtations from a few of the debutantes who had been making eyes at him last summer . The younger Evans was far less demanding than his sister so he didn't dread this request from him in the least . ' I will see to it myself , Mr. Ryan ' Ryan stole another glance towards Kelsi .' You can tell her it's from me ' ' Very well ' Fulton scurried back to the drink station in the kitchen before Sharpay found another reason to pull him in on her schemes this evening thus giving him yet another bleeding ulcer . If her parents, his employeers , weren't such fair bosses, he would go back to being a dang clerk in a law office in Roswell in a heartbeat and have less pain . ' Zeke, the Evans table needs three tiramusu and a chocolate mousse for your girlfriend ' called out Chad , grumbling under his breath as he entered the kitchen . It had been his luck that he had gotten the Evans table this evening and he hoped they tipped well because they were a pain ,' Thank God they want wine and I get a flipping break soon ' Zeke plated the desserts then worked on Sharpay's dish of mousse adding a delicate raspberry to top it off. He would win her over eventually even if it took all summer or if he ever got a break from the promise land that was this kitchen . ' I could help you deliver them, man ' ' Yes, Zeke,' Fulton turned as all of the young people went still at his presence ,' relieve Jason on refilling the drinks , if you will. ' He blew out a tired breath and handed the young man the cold iced tea,' however first you will deliver this drink to Miss. Nielsen and be sure to inform her it is compliments of Ryan Evans . ' ' I need some air ' While Fulton stepped away to the front desk for an Tums break , Zeke stared at the glass of tea the man had given him then shared wide grins with the rest of his friends. ' Ryan is buying Kelsi a drink now ' Chad fixed him with a sour look .' It isn't the smoothiest move but I doubt Evans has much game at all . It's probably nothing , guys , because they were fighting the other day since he was pretty much a jerk to her' Martha rolled her eyes as she prepared the coffee .' You guys are such guys and know nothing . Obviously this is a sign that Ryan is thinking about her and its awfully sweet ' Chad tried balancing the tray of dessert but shook his head at Martha.' I've heard Kelsi call him a rat dozens of time so I think your nuts, Martha ' ' Taylor calls you names all of the time but that doesn't mean she isn't dating you , Chad ' Chad shot her an annoyed look .' Leave me and Taylor out of this , please ' Martha just grinned .' Just pointing out the obvious ' Zeke removed his apron , wiped the condensation off of the iced tea glass , then straightening his posture walked out to the main dining room where Kelsi had switched to some classical music that he couldn't identify if he tried . He took stock of all of the members and guests, the fancy clothes, the glow of the candlelight on the tables, as he searched for the object of his affection . There Sharpay was at the family table just lighting the whole room up with her presence , her blonde hair half up, half down, her dress a glittery gold sheath, and Zeke thought she was just spectacular . She was like a beautiful goddess in gold . He tried to catch her eye but Sharpay seemed to be focused on Troy, again , who appeared to be joining the whole Evans clan at the table for some chit chat . He looked a little uncomfortable but that might be because Sharpay was gushing all over him . That spelled trouble anyway you wanted to look at it but surely Bolton could handle it . Zeke tried to push down the sting of jealousy that he felt though he had no right . ' Hey Kelsi ,' Zeke placed a napkin on the top of the baby grand then sat the iced tea on it ,' how is it going out here for you ? ' Kelsi managed a small smile . ' Trying not to put myself to sleep and oh, you brought me a drink . Thanks so much , Zeke , I am dying of thirst here ' ' Not from me . Ryan sent it over for you ' Color suffused Kelsi's cheeks as she glanced towards the Evans table , his sea glass eyes collided with her own as Ryan gave her a ridiculous little wave and a sheepish smile as another little ping went through the composers system . She took a quick sip then slid back into the Bach before the natives grew restless on her and with this crowd, Kelsi wasn't entirely sure what would happen or if Mr. Fulton wouldn't fire her on the spot . Or if she should let Ryan try to charm her like he was doing or if that wasn't a horrible idea in the first place . It wasn't as if they had anything in common . Kelsi didn't want to be a summer fling for anyone , let alone Ryan Evans . ' Your awfully quiet , Kelsi ' ' Working , Zeke, but thanks ' ' Yeah, yeah , I know ,' replied a thoughtful Zeke , staring once more at Sharpay with a wistful expression on his face,' I've got to refill glasses but you know , it isn't so bad that Ryan actually noticed you, my friend . I'd give anything for sister to actually see me …' Feeling sorry for her friends crush not being reciprocated , Kelsi continued playing but found her gaze returning time again to connect with Ryan calling herself out of her mind for considering the possibility of them together . *****************************************Summer ************************** Ryan couldn't sleep in , the morning sun slanting in through the blinds in his room so he woke , showered and changed into white linen shorts and a red and white polo shirt intent on heading up to the dining room to snag from breakfast and maybe catch Kelsi before she started her shift this morning . If he had looked into her schedule it was because he was interested ….might as well not lie to himself, he had found out her schedule so that he could find time to get to know her better . He wasn't some creepy stalker guy , he just didn't know how to get Kelsi to take him seriously . They didn't have a problem talking one on one so Ryan intended to catch her alone as much as possible and hope for the best. Kelsi hadn't been pissed over him sending her tea so he took that as a good sign and was angling to work in a breakfast date if he could . Ryan had begged off a morning spa outing with his mother and sister and his father was holed up in the office wheeling and dealing already which couldn't have been more perfect for him because they left him all alone . Still plotting about how to approach Kelsi without using dumb pick up lines or acting like an idiot around her, Ryan stepped into the nearly empty dining room, stopping at the sounds of what could only be a goergous duet between Troy and Gabriella . He poked his head around the corner quickly then the sudden panic hit him square in the chest because his and Shar's tired , old number wouldn't stand up against this powerful duet. It would be almost like a repeat of the spring musical all over again. Ryan paused to listen , could detect the faintest soft voice that belonged to Kelsi joining her voice with the couples . It was an incredible song and sure to win hands down the Star Dazzle Award without a doubt ! All rationale thought went out of his head as Ryan blocked out the conversation drifting from the others, his desire to win that award wiping everything out , feeling as if he didn't get a win this year, all would be lost to him . He worked hard, dammit, he deserved a win ! If Troy and Gabriella sang this incredible duet, they would win, hands down and steal the show away from him and his sister ! He flipped open his phone, punching in Sharpay's cell, jaw tense as he informed her on this new development . It didn't occur to him that he was right out in the open . ' Sis, we have a problem ,' informed Ryan , all business ,' Kelsi wrote a new song but it isn't for us . If Troy and Gabriella sing it , it will turn into their own show instead of ours ' ' Leave Troy to me , I'll take care of it ' ' The song is incredible , Shar ' ' Ryan ' Ryan hung up on his sister , turning around to find an indignant looking Kelsi staring at him, hurt mingling with the flash of anger in her eyes alerting him to the fact she must have overheard his conversation which was very, very bad. ' Kelsi , hi ' ' That's it ? I was actually coming to thank you for the iced tea and now I find you, what, Ryan, spying on me for your sister ? Or did you plan this all on your own ? Be sweet to me so you could throw me off guard so that I could hand you over my latest song ? ' She had been in a good mood until she had found Ryan standing by the doorway , making no move to hide , scheming about her to his evil twin and Kelsi felt disheartened in that second as if she had been the fool all along . All of these stupid games is why she didn't date much . Ryan dropped his phone , felt red rise to his face, embarrassed and ashamed all together . ' It isn't like that…' he tried then winced at the scowl Kelsi directed towards him ,' I mean, not exactly …..the Star Dazzle Award is complicated. I wasn't spying on you directly …..I'm messing this whole thing up because actually I just was coming to see you ' Kelsi crossed her arms across her chest, keeping her voice level and calm though she felt anything but those things . God, my judgment is horrible ! Letting herself be swayed by sea glass eyes and a silly , sweet gesture to put stars and hearts in my eyes . ' My songs are not available to you or your sister ,' answered Kelsi, coolly ,' you can save the lies and backpedaling for all those groupies that follow you two around because I don't want to hear it . You want to spend your whole summer at your sisters bidding and under her thumb , that is your prerogative .' ' I wont allow myself to be used by you, Ryan Evans , so you can just take all the charming smiles and the tea to another girl that isn't me because we're through here ' ' I'm not , I wouldn't ….dammit, I'm sorry ! ' Unfortunatly , Ryan was talking to air as Kelsi had already left the building needing to walk off her feelings . She still had fifteen minutes before she started work and found herself poolside where Gabriella was refilling the towel bins and looking cute in her regulation red suit and light weight summer jacket . Her friend always appeared as if nothing ruffled her feathers. ' Hey Kelsi , I thought you were going to find Ryan ' Kelsi adjusted her frames on her bridge of her nose as she bit down on her lower lip . She didn't want to be a part in the gossip but if she told Martha what had went down , the entire kitchen staff would know her business . It was bad enough that Kelsi was entertaining romantic thoughts about Ryan in the first place and now she was mortified . ' You could hold off on the violins, Gabi,' reassured Kelsi, a touch of bitterness in her tone ,' Ryan has his own agenda and I was just a pawn . That arrogant rat was spying on me ! He tried to deny it but I heard him ! It will be a cold day in hell before I write a song for Ryan Evans ! Gabriella tossed the towel in place then reached for Kelsi's arm, giving it a sympathetic squeeze . ' Not that I am surprised with the spying but I also think that maybe Ryan just does things without thinking about them first ,' suggested Gabriella , who had gotten to know Ryan a little better last year during math class . He wasn't as confident as he came across she had decided ,' he likes to please his sister, I think . You might give him another chance to explain and apologize' ' No,' dismissed Kelsi, fiddling with her long earring ,' it's better than I nip whatever this thing is in the bud before it even starts. Can you imagine me with Ryan in the first place ? ' Gabriella considered , carefully . Hadn't she had those very thoughts about herself and Troy last year ? It had been wondrous and confusing and painful but in the end , love won and she didn't regret it at all. She and Troy were blissfully happy together . ' I don't think it's so crazy, Kels, ' finished Gabriella ,' though it is a little bit crazy to end something that could be wonderful before its even had a chance to start . I truly believe that Ryan Evans is one of the good guys out there and those are rare' Kelsi made disgruntled noises as she contemplated her friends advice . She knew that there was another side to Ryan , had seen it briefly a time or two, and waged a war with herself about her own attraction to the guy . Honestly , she was freaking losing her damn mind ! ' Maybe but right now , Ryan is still the bully who doesn't care about me at all '\"][Chapter 5] ['Kelsi was feeling restless and a little bored . It was her one day off from work at Lava Springs which meant that she should be happy and doing handsprings if she even knew how to do them which she didn\\'t but oddly enough she wasn\\'t . Sleeping in had gotten her until 9 in the morning so she was well rested . The house was quiet since her parents had went to work with only the hum of the air conditioner to keep her company as she dressed for the day. Most of her friends still worked today though Martha and Jason were scheduled to get off at one this afternoon but they had a tennis date so Kelsi wasn\\'t meeting them until much later in the afternoon . The musician considered cleaning out her closet or working on another song but Kelsi was afraid it wouldn\\'t be any good given her out of sorts mood . She blamed it entirely on Ryan Evans for confusing her long enough for her to come to the realization that she might actually really be attracted to him, actually like him, only for him to revert back to form . He hadn\\'t even attempted to follow after her to atleast try to give her some sort of apology or explain though being a spying jerk was pretty cut and dried to Kelsi – still Ryan hadn\\'t even bothered with her . It wasn\\'t as if Kelsi was searching for romance because honestly she wasn\\'t but she also couldn\\'t deny the tingles and the pings that she got when Ryan touched her hand – it had been a little scary but oh so thrilling . The romantic inside of her wished for more of everything , wished for love , and all that entailed from the whirlwind of feelings and emotions to the heat and the passion. None of which she had felt for herself yet as she hadn\\'t found that one guy for her , that wasn\\'t meant to be , but still Kelsi loved to write about the power of love . Her take on the feelings – not ripping of the lyrics of the great Huey Lewis . Sighing at herself for following her wandering trail of thoughts, Kelsi went to her closet to throw on a red tee shirt dress that barely hit her knees pulling on a wide white belt to cinch the waist and a pair of red tennis shoes then adding a pinstriped cap at the last minute . It was funky and fun. Perfect for her style . Grabbing her oversized bag and car keys , the composer decided it was the time to hop in the car and see where it might take her . Too bad she had work in the morning or she would drive out to Roswell, grab lunch at that cool Crashdown Café, and maybe hit up the UFO museum to get her out of her weird mood . Even though Kelsi had a romantic streak over brooding , dashing heroes of the past and powerful love stories , she also loved the whole crash of 1947 thing being somewhat of an afficinado though not quite the crazed alien conspirator . Martha loved to tease her about it constantly . She contemplated dropping by the halfway house that her mother ran and see what was going on, maybe sit in on a few group chats, but with her wonky mood, that might not be the best idea that she ever contemplated . Kelsi could hardly offer up suggestions for someone else when she didn\\'t even understand her own unsettling feelings at the moment . Annnoyed with herself , Kelsi found herself driving into town, parking the car, and heading into Hubs , the local diner that was a throwback to Al\\'s Diner on Happy Days, and one of the gangs hang outs . The air condition hit her as she breezed into the diner taking note that it was hardly packed given the early hour, a couple of freshman boys she recognized from East High sat at the counter finishing up their breakfast and trying to out lame one another with outlandish stories , a group of stylished dressed young women in the latest fashion sat at a table nursing their Diet Coke and making shopping plans , while a couple in their twenties consulted the jukebox . Color Me Badd was currently crooning their old 90\\'s hit from the jukebox making Kelsi blush at the seductive words of the song before sliding into an empty booth herself . Hal, the owner of Hubs, spotted one of his favorite customers as he made a beeline for her table . He was a handsome man in his late thirties with curling blonde hair and a wide smile , the affable sort that got along with most everyone . \\' Kelsi, good morning . So, how does the other half live ? \\' Hal knew that Lava Springs country club had hired on a large number of young people as staff this summer cutting into his summer help here in the process . The grapevine in town was small and kids liked to talk , especially to him . \\' Pretty well with the being waited on hand and foot ,\\' answered Kelsi, with a little laugh ,\\' though I haven\\'t moved past the piano so much \\' \\' That\\'s the breaks \\' chuckled Hal, good naturally,\\' can I get you breakfast ?\\' \\' Scrambled eggs, bacon, and a Earl Gray tea\\' \\' Of course \\' Hal dashed back into the kitchen with her order as Kelsi fiddled with the menu, glancing behind her ever so wistfully at the couple , as she tried to really listen to the words of the song that had replaced Color Me Badd . It was called Save the Best for Last and the lovely lyrics were the epitome of romantic so full of longing that it made her ache for it herself . It was almost a pity that she and Jason hadn\\'t worked out-except that it really wasn\\'t as they had zero chemistry between them . Not a single tiny spark to boot but they turned out to be good friends . Which Kelsi was honestly okay with because Martha and Jason had that connection and away from the gossip and drama of East High, a romance between them had finally taken off . She couldn\\'t have been more happier for them . Who knew kitchen duty would bring Martha and Jason together ? Chad and Taylor seemed to be doing well too and the musician could tell that being with funny , sometimes cocky jock, had lightened up the ever conservative Taylor for the better . As for Troy and Gabriella , well, they were still true love personified even if Sharpay was plotting to sink her hot pink claws into Troy . Lost in her musings , Kelsi didn\\'t hear the sound of the bell ringing over the door or notice when Ryan Evans strode into the diner and up to the counter where Hal\\'s pretty wife, Dana , approached him , a pot of brewed coffee at the ready and a friendly smile . \\' Good morning , Ryan , and what brings you away from your summer home this early in the morning and back into town ? \\' \\' Mom needed some things from home so I volunteered to drive back and get them for her ,\\' Ryan slid onto the stool , leaning forward, slightly ,\\' I really , really don\\'t need the coffee but , what the heck, hit me up \\' Dana nodded in sympathy as she filled his cup. \\' Sister problems ? \\' Ryan took a drink, groaned when the coffee burned his tongue .\\' I just noticed , I mean, really noticed that my sister runs my life and up until now, I pretty much do whatever she wants me to do and it\\'s made me a jerk. Toss in my ambition and I lose my mind and turn into more of a jerk and I don\\'t know what the hell I am doing anymore …\\' Dana patted his hand . The younger Evans had been coming into the diner alone now for a while , ordering the same thing , and brooding for an hour until Dana started conversation with Ryan , drawing him out . It wasn\\'t long before Dana came to realize that under the ego , the cockiness, the wealth, Ryan was more than that and a lonely soul in his sisters shadow. \\' Well, it\\'s about time you figured things out ! That deserves a bagel \\' \\' The New York kind with cream cheese \\' Dana met her husband as he was coming out of the kitchen with Kelsi\\'s food , jerked her head towards the counter and Ryan in a knowing way . \\' Our young Gene Kelly here finally hit a breakthrough ,\\' declared Dana , green eyes twinkling mischeviously ,\\' and I see our shy girl is hiding again , honey, and they both came here .\\' Hal shook his head, catching her drift .\\' Dana, we\\'re a diner, not Dr. Ruth \\' \\' It\\'s a sign \\' \\' It\\'s a sign that my wife needs to stop watching Sleepless in Seattle and seeing signs where there are none ,\\' replied Hal, gently ,\\' which is why I am going to take this to Kelsi before the eggs get cold .\\' \\' Spoil sport \\' \" This isn\\'t the Peach Pit either \\' called out Hal, making a beeline to serve the petite brunnette her breakfast,\\' here you go. I\\'ll be out with your tea in a minute \\' \\' Thanks , Hal \\' smiled Kelsi as she reached for the salt , turning slightly then froze when they locked onto Ryan and the breath whooshed out of her , deflating ,\\' Drat !\\' Ryan was the last person on Earth that Kelsi wanted to see on her day off and had been trying to work through how she could still continue doing her job while managing avoiding him but had come up with zilch . Oh, she knew it was on the immature side , probably a little ridiculous , but the least painful for her while she sorted through her feelings . It was much easier with songs as they were always around when you needed them , they\\'d pick you up when you were down, and really, songs , words and lyrics were all a girl needed without the messiness of an real life relationship . \\' Mr. Charming over there is making goopy eyes at you, Kelsi,\\' replied Hal, in a conspirator whisper ,\\' might be less painless for all involved if one of you joined the other before my wife takes the control from out of your hands \\' Feeling as if he had done his duty, Hal left the table to go refill coffee cups, check on the rest of the customers, and play a tune that was less angst ridden than the current choice of \\'I Was a Teenage Dirtbag \\' in favor of some old school Journey . While Kelsi sipped her herbal tea and tried not to be hyper aware of Ryan Evans watching her , the dancer stole another furitive glance at her as he gulped down the hot coffee, groaning when it burned his tongue , as he reached for the cold water to soothe . Be a man , Evans . He adjusted his hat, yanked at the collar of his green tee shirt , squared his shoulders, and took another drink of the rich coffee for the extra shot of courage he needed . Boy, that coffee was strong . Ryan really needed to stop stress drinking coffee or he\\'d be wound up for days on end . Feeling like a big , fat coward and knowing that he wouldn\\'t ever be able to face Kelsi again if he didn\\'t apologize to her and try to clear the air between them , Ryan surged forward to approach her and felt her lift her gaze to his in question . Kelsi chewed on her inside of her lower lip.\\' I don\\'t need company, Ryan \\' Ryan yanked off his hat, holding the bill in his hands as the words tumbled out of him. \\' I am sorry, Kelsi, so very sorry . God, I know it seems like all I do is screw things up royally and apologize to you every time we meet but it\\'s true . My head is all messed up and in a weird place right now which I know doesn\\'t have a thing to do with you and my own sister is trying to knock me from the show so I think when I heard your new song, I just went a little insane \\' Kelsi rested her arms on the table as she fixed him with a solemn look . \\' My music isn\\'t up for grabs for you or your sister to just take from me . How many times do I have to defend myself to you ? \\' I get it , I mean, you don\\'t need to explain again . I am damn sorry I presumed , well, what I did and I\\'m working on changing Sharpay\\'s mind about the whole number …which is slightly difficult to do when I want to avoid her \\' Kelsi found herself wavering as she could plainly see how much Ryan was wrestling with on a personal front but she didn\\'t want to get involved or be involved with him . \\' I, uh, thought maybe we could start over this time with ..ah, a date \\' Kelsi pushed the glasses up on the bridge of her nose , blinked behind the frames, and tried to ignore the little twist in her belly from the invitation which she couldn\\'t , wouldn\\'t accept . Hadn\\'t she already decided once and for all that she wasn\\'t getting involved with Ryan Evans ? \\' Since I don\\'t want things to be even more weird between us, I guess I will accept your apology this time around . As for the other thing …\\' \\' A date \\' \\' Yes, a date , but I mean, no , no, \\' repeated Kelsi, trying to ignore her attraction to him and how he rattled her just by being near ,\\' I don\\'t want to go out with you ..because in our case, I think it\\'d be bad messing with the status quo and all \\' \\' Really , Kelsi ? \\' challenged Ryan, leaning down to peer at her pretty face,\\' I didn\\'t think you cared about the whole stupid popularity thing ? \\' Kelsi straightend , her back up , her tone defensive .\\' I don\\'t one way or the other but that isn\\'t why I wont go out on a date with you , Ryan . I just don\\'t trust you \\' Ryan leaned down , lifted her hand to his lips, and brushed the lightest of a sweeping kiss across her fingertips rendering the musician completely dazed by the romantic gesture . \\' Don\\'t be so sure of that - I will win your trust back . Give me time \\' Kelsi heart stumbled and stopped . She was very afraid that Ryan would do exactly that and she would be powerless to stop herself from believing him . \\''][Chapter 6] [\"Freedom from work was glorious! Though Martha and Jason didn't dislike their kitchen jobs at Lava Springs nearly as much as they had that first week of work, only working until one that afternoon made them quite the happy pair. After changing back into their normal clothes, Jason drove them back into town to the tennis courts near the park for a friendly game before meeting with Kelsi . Although Jason was every bit the jock as much so as the rest of his friends, tennis wasn't his game but Martha insisted that it would be the fun. He thought that Martha was pretty great and enjoyed just spending time with her even if it meant being humiliated at tennis. He was much better at badminton. ' Come on, Jase, ' called out Martha , her perky ponytail bopping along with her as she served the ball with gusto,' are you just going to let me trounce you ? ' Jason ducked as the ball landed behind him and he sent her a sheepish grin. 'Yeah, I think that's a good bet,' answered Jason, tugging on his ball cap,' I told you I'm really not into this game. Basketball is my game.' 'Then I'm just the girl to shake you up a bit, Cross 'teased Martha, lowering her eyes,' if that's okay with you.' A wide, goofy grin spread across Jason's face. 'It's very okay with me, Martha ' He couldn't believe that he had wasted so much time during the school year wondering about Martha and if she could be interested in a simple guy like him. She was cute, funny, a really smart girl, and he didn't figure he had a shot with her . Thank God for summer and Martha making the first move because Jason felt as if everything was suddenly like it should be between them. Romance came natural. They still might be brand new dating but they were good. ' You know , I am kind of glad we're stuck in the kitchen most of the time ,' decided Jason, leaning on his tennis racket ,' Danforth is about to lose his mind dealing with all of those demanding guests and Troy is like being sucked into waiting on Sharpay all of the time .' Martha lowered her own racket, crossing the court to speak to her boyfriend. ' I hate to say it but Troy didn't look like it was killing him the other morning when he joined Sharpay and her Dad for breakfast ,' admitted Martha , who had been refilling the bread basket that day ,' Fulton didn't say a word about it either .' 'Mr. Evans seemed decent enough,' replied Jason, trying to put a positive spin on it ,' it's probably nothing like we're thinking ' Martha leaned across the net to kiss him, lightly. ' That's why I like you so much, Jason, but I'm afraid it is exactly what it looks like which is Sharpay trying to sink her claws into Troy' Jason tugged on the bright fuchsia bandana that decorated her hair. 'Troy is crazy about Gabriella and he mostly ignores Sharpay's moves at school. He is just doing his job because the Evans pay us to work at the club ' Martha shook her head.' I hope your right but I don't think it looks good.' Don't go mentioning that to Zeke ,' begged Jason , thinking of his good natured friend ,' Zeke is already kind of jealous of Troy being forced to spend time with Sharpay . Cuz you know, Zeke thought he'd have a chance to try to win her over this summer and all.' 'I feel bad for Zeke but he must have blinders on because Sharpay doesn't have a sweet, even nice bone in her body. That viper is never going to give him the time of day ' Jason lifted his shoulders then shrugged. 'Zeke's like a brother to me, I'm not going to crush his dream by being a crappy friend. If Sharpay decides to grow a heart this summer, there is the slightest possibility of her and Zeke maybe happening ' Zeke had encouraged him about giving dating a shot with Martha and that was turning out really good. Jason wasn't as confident as the rest of his buddies as far as dating went and didn't' often pick up on the obvious clues either. He and Kelsi were a good example of that – last year he had asked her out on a date, they had went out, and discovered they had zero chemistry and nothing in common except the shy part so, they agreed to just stay friends . However he had always kind of liked Martha but Jason knew that girls had all sorts of crazy rules that made no sense and Martha was Kelsi's best friend so he hadn't done anything up until now. Jason tugged off his cap, blinked at Martha in the bright sunlight, chewing on a thought. 'This…us….i mean, it isn't just like a summer fling. Right? Martha's mouth pulled down in a puzzled look.' You think that I am the type of girl that just wants to have a fun, summer fling and go our separate ways when the summer is over? ' 'Uh, no,' mustered Jason, thrown for a loop at the tone of her voice that sounded angry,' no to both. I didn't mean anything or that you or I would want that because I don't …. I don't even know why I said that. I'm stupid.' Martha was a thinker which always served her well at school but in life, she sometimes overthought things too much. She weighed the possibility of being mad at him for even suggesting a fling in the first place reconsidered again because it came from Jason. It was his boyish charm that attracted her and deep down she knew it had been a harmless question undoubtedly picked up from dumb boy locker room talk or something. It wasn't worth making it their first fight or risking their relationship over it either. Martha walked briskly over to him, tennis forgotten, and draped her arms around his neck. 'How about we just be a couple and not sweat the small stuff ' As they sealed it with a long kiss, everything out faded into the black. *****************************************Break****************************** Kelsi still hadn't been able to shake off her weird mood , her fingers still tingled from where Ryan Evans had kissed them, and she couldn't seem to concentrate on her music if she tried which annoyed her to no end . Music was her life and she lived and breathed it . There were always music and lyrics playing around in her head but they were all jumbled up. After her breakfast at Hubs, Kelsi had wandered into the local thrift store perusing the aisles for hidden treasures but only finding a pair of bright yellow plastic dangly earrings for Martha and an ivory lace colored hat for herself. She had spent a whopping three dollars. It still wasn't quite time to meet with her friends so the composer decided to check out the local Music store which wasn't busy this afternoon except for a group of young middle schoolers studying the piano sheet music and an older man testing out the electric guitars . Glancing at the beautiful baby Grand in the corner then noticing the old school synthizer in the middle of the store, Kelsi couldn't resist the lure of it. Though it was much bigger than her own electric keyboard at home, there was something appealing about the bulky music machine. Kelsi tossed her bag on the floor, turned on the keyboard, her fingers hovering over the keys, as she smoothed her lips in a thin line, contemplating a song to get the feel of it then she just knew. It was a song that her Mom sang over and over when she was trying to get through helping a lost teen down at the Halfway house or just feeling a little down. It was a song that always made her feel better and since Kelsi couldn't put a name to her own feelings at the moment, it seemed to fit the bill perfect. 'Another turn, another choice to make ' Which one is the answer? Which one should I take? ' 'Sometimes I wonder if it's always been this way 'sang Ryan, from across the room,' come what may ' Surprised evident on her face, Kelsi continued playing, adding the next verse to the song as Ryan joined her on the bench,' Come what, I'll be waiting for it ' 'I know the wind that brought it didn't mean me any harm ' Her lips curved, slightly. 'It won't really matter, it's up to me ' 'Come what may ' Kelsi stopped playing turning slightly to look at him.' Are you following me, Ryan? I thought you'd be scurrying back to the country club …' A slow smile crossed his handsome face as he shook his head. 'No, I, uh, needed to get my head together better before I went back to the club and my sister. I've kind of been just moping around town then I noticed you in the window and couldn't resist ' She folded her hands together.' Oh ' Kelsi gave him a nervous smile.' How do you know this song? It is a personal favorite of mine but it's not exactly something I figured anyone else would rock out too ' Ryan grinned at her, making her blush, prettily. ' My Mother had a crush on Danny Amatullo so she made me watch the whole Fame TV series ,' explained Ryan, hesitantly ,' I wanted to be a triple threat like Leroy and be as cool as Danny . ' He gave an embarrassed laugh as Ryan tugged off his hat. 'I however do not have his Italian charm obviously since you know, not Italian, and girls would rather date me for my money than for myself. I don't seem to be making much of a good impression on you either ' She hoped he couldn't see the flush on her cheeks brought on by his closeness and the compliment. Kelsi found herself weakening to his charms and her heart tugged a bit that he knew one of her favorites too. Maybe they did have something in common, after all. Was she being fair to Ryan? 'I might have overreacted a little bit, Ryan,' admitted Kelsi, tentatively,' I want to believe that you aren't using me for your own manipulative reasons but you make it really difficult.' ' I deserved that but I want to change , Kelsi,' confessed Ryan , holding her gaze ,' I am trying because it's become very clear to me that I need to do my own thing . Be my own person and I can't be that guy if I let my sister pull my strings all of the time.' Kelsi nodded.' It'd be nice not to argue with you every time we see one another ' 'Could we try this again, Kelsi ? ' 'I suppose third time is the charm …maybe ' She may be losing her mind but Ryan Evans had gotten under her skin somehow and Kelsi was intrigued enough to wonder how they might be if they were together. It certainly couldn't hurt to try to test out the waters and see for herself. 'We could maybe go to the matinée' suggested Ryan,' how do you feel about old movies? ' 'I like them ' 'High Society is playing downtown,' replied Ryan who loved the screwball romantic musicals of the past. He had been inspired by all the great dancers like Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire,' that's a classic. We could go see it together …..If you wanted to...With me ' 'I would but could we see it another time? 'Stumbled Kelsi, 'I'm supposed to meet Martha and Jason today or it'd be fine. Unless you have to go back to your families club tonight?' ' Well I am supposed to take some things back to Mom so probably ' Ryan could have kicked himself for his poor timing but he knew he would be expected ,' or you know I have a copy of High Society on DVd, maybe we could watch it together one night after your shift ends ' 'Sure ' Feeling his confidence rising, Ryan let out a happy sigh that things might be finally starting to go his way. He and Kelsi might have gotten off on really rocky ground but now it felt as if they have gotten past, well; the past and she agreed to go out on a date with him. ' Good ' declared Ryan as his phone blasted loudly in the semi quiet shop as he pulled the cell out of his pocket all the while sending Kelsi an embarrassed smile ,' Hello ' Derby's smooth voice trilled over the phone. 'Ryan, darling, is there a problem? You've been gone well over an hour and a half and I've just been informed I need to plan a soiree for your father's business associates tonight. Your sister is much too busy doing her own thing to be of help to me and would you be a dear , hurry back and give me a hand ' Ryan let out a groan at his moms request for help. Leave it to his father to make summer family time into a working summer to bring in more business but then he should know better than to expect anything different from the man. It also meant that his Mom would be working to make this soiree a class act all by herself without putting extra burden on the staff. Derby had spent summers when she was younger working at a country club so she was very vocal and hands on when it came to running Lava Springs herself. She wouldn't have any qualms in about jumping in and arranging flowers either. 'Sorry, Mom, I was. I mean, I'm with Kelsi ,' stammered Ryan, nervous all of the sudden ,' I got distracted . You know, Mom, I bet Taylor would be just great at helping you get things ready and I'm sure Mr. Fulton could take over her duties while she helps you ' ' Taylor has her hands full with Tilky Braden ,' explained Derby with a long suffering sigh ,' the woman is a menace but that young lady is handling her like a pro . I wouldn't dare deprive her of the massive tip she'll likely receive …I am sure you and I will be able to handle things just fine ' Ryan adored his mother and knew he couldn't say no, he wasn't that selfish. Not to mention that he knew there was zero chance of Sharpay making any effort to help , not when she expected to lounge by the pool being waited on like a princess that she thought she was . 'I'll be back in thirty minutes ' 'Thank you, Duckie ' Ryan hung up the phone and sent Kelsi a chagrined look.' Sorry about that but it was my Mom panicking because Dad sprung on her that he wants a fancy cocktail party for some of his business friends at Lava Springs for tonight. ' 'You're going back to give your Mom a hand with it? Wouldn't it be easier if she just put the staff to work on the party ' 'Oh, Mom will have the kitchen staff prepare a special menu for this but she won't drag the other workers in to help with this thing,' explained Ryan, knowingly,' I'll help my mother with the rest of the stuff ' 'That is really sweet of you ' This time, Ryan colored. 'Yeah, well, it's my Mom 'he continued,' Uh, I'm really sorry I can't stick around, Kelsi, but I need to get back to the club ' 'I understand. We'll talk later, Ryan ' He grazed his knuckles lightly across her cheek and heard her sigh.' Count on it ' As Ryan left the shop, Kelsi moved her hands over the keys, feeling the intensity that hung between them, bringing her back around to the song that connected them. Come what may I'll be waiting for it I'll be okay Kelsi rested her hands on the keyboard , a wistful sigh escaping her mouth ,' I think the wind brought me Ryan Evans '\"][Chapter 7] ['The air conditioned family den of the Cox house had beckoned Kelsi to join her friends there for the evening rather than the original plan of meeting at the mall to hang out in the food court then window shopping . It was an impromptu party of sorts as Zeke had gotten out of work fairly early and Jason suggested that he join them for watching movies. Zeke\\'s day had been upsetting for the baker and he was now regaling his friends with what had sent him into his current mode. He was a pretty positive guy but right now he was anything but happy goes lucky. It sucked big time. \\' I made chocolate chip muffins special for Sharpay this morning ,\\' groaned a distraught Zeke , as Martha handed him a bowl of popcorn ,\\' Delivered them to her table this morning myself and do you know what she did ? \\' Jason accepted the soda from his girlfriend then gave his pal a patient smile. Zeke had been a bit loud and on edge over the phone which wasn\\'t norm for his friend which meant that something was going on and it wasn\\'t good. Figured it was about Sharpay. \\'She gave you a kiss? \\' Zeke made a face, tossed a handful of popcorn in the air then caught it in the bowl as his shoulders fell as if in defeat. Man, it was hard to process. \\'She pulled Troy over to her table so he could have breakfast with her,\\' finished up Zeke, feeling as if Bolton had betrayed him,\\' our captain didn\\'t dodge her but dug right into those muffins. They shared muffins \" Kelsi reached over to touch his hand in sympathy.\\' I\\'m really sorry, Zeke, but maybe it\\'s for the best. I mean we all know Sharpay is a diva at school but she isn\\'t any nicer at the club either.\\' Kelsi knew that she couldn\\'t just duck and hide from the mean girl either and fully expected to be ordered to become Sharpay\\'s personal pianist as needed at the club. Despite all of her bravado with Ryan, she knew it wasn\\'t as simple as her turning down the request. It would be considered part of her job which she was getting paid for , of course. Zeke tugged a pillow off the couch, wrapping his arms around it in sheer frustration. \\'Thanks, Kelsi, but that doesn\\'t change how I feel about her,\\' explained a determined Zeke, trying to get his mojo fired up again,\\' I know you all think I\\'m nuts but I see this other side of Sharpay , glimpses of this sweet girl that I know is there . This whole thing is hard \\' Jason took the popcorn from him.\\' Troy really had breakfast with her?\\' Zeke glowered at him.\\' I served them so yeah, they shared a meal \\' Martha shared a worried look with Kelsi .\\' Does Gabriella know about their breakfast interlude?\\' Troy and Gabriella was the steadiest couple at East High and the math genius very trusted of people especially her boyfriend. Troy was one of the good guys but it was a proven fact, the guy made horrible decisions, reacting first before thinking things through. Zeke made a disgruntled sound.\\' Taylor saw them when she was giving a morning tour of the club to some new potential guests so going out on a limb here , Gabi knows now \\' Martha sighed deliberating on whether this was worthy of girl talk with Gabriella or just more fodder for gossip. It really wasn\\'t any of her business yet it was curious. Usually Troy ran from Sharpay \\'s attention not join her for a cozy breakfast so that was strange . As if sensing her best friend\\'s train of thought, Kelsi gave her a knowing look.\\' I don\\'t think we should meddle in whatever is or isn\\'t going on with Troy and Sharpay one way or the other. Come on, you guys, we all know how devoted to Gabriella that Troy is \\' \\' Kelsi is right but the whole thing is weird \\' contributed Jason , looking up from the titles of Martha\\'s DVD picks in front of him on the floor ,\\' Martha , all of these movies are like from the 1980\\'s \\' Pretty in Pink, Footloose, and The Breakfast Club were three classics in her book. \\'These are awesome movies \\' Martha looked expectantly at her best friend waiting for her to help her out in defense of her all-time favorite choice of movies but a glance at Kelsi who wore a far off look had her puzzling. Given her friend could be quiet and revert back to her natural shyness at times but she had a niggling feeling that it was something more than just that. \\' Kelsi, how is it like where you are at ? \\' Kelsi gave a self-deprecating little smile.\\' Sorry. Interesting day is all \\' She was still digesting the fact that she had agreed to go on a date with Ryan Evans. Kelsi wasn\\'t trying to change her mind about it or him though a hundred reasons why she should played a litany in her head but the composer tamped it down. Ryan really was charming and it struck her as cute how he blundered about when he got flustered over things and oh boy, she liked him. Martha arched a perfect brow.\\' Oh really and what was so interesting? Did you compose a new rock number for a Broadway play?\\' \\'I wish,\\' managed Kelsi, under her breath,\\' Um, I sort of had a couple of interesting run ins with Ryan Evans this morning.\\' She paused again , mulling over how much she wanted to share with Martha and the guys ,\\' Interesting but not wildly romantic in the sense though the thing is that Ryan asked me out on a date and I said yes \\' Jason considered this thoughtfully before responding as he had many of the same classes with the dude last semester. They weren\\'t buds or anything but he always kind of got the impression that the younger Evans was mostly misunderstood. Jason could relate because so was he – he knew there were those that thought he was just a dumb jock when he just a little slow on the studying. Ryan was seen as the brother hanging onto his sisters coattails so to speak so most people didn\\'t give him the benefit either. \\'Ryan isn\\'t so bad,\\' contributed Jason,\\' I bet you and he have a lot in common, Kelsi \\' Kelsi blushed as she tried to pull her short curls down to her shoulders.\\' I don\\'t know about that or if Ryan just caught me at a weak moment. It may be nothing ….\\' Martha bit her tongue knowing the \\'I told you so\\' remark would not set well with her friend when it was quite obvious that Kelsi was nervous about liking Ryan in the first place , she figured the sparks had been just simmering between the composer and the dancer waiting for the right time for a romance . Wasn\\'t that fitting? \\'Don\\'t let Fulton know about your thing with Ryan Evans,\\' warned Zeke, trying to be diplomatic,\\' unless your name is Troy Bolton, the boss man is watching us like a dang hawk looking for reasons to can us. Chad and Taylor got a lecture on their break the other day because they were holding hands on the grounds …..And he\\'s already written up Gabi\\' If Zeke was jealous and slightly bitter, Zeke was trying to deal with it the best that he could and he really didn\\'t want Kelsi to get fired because of a stupid crush on Ryan Evans. Kelsi\\'s stomach did somersaults as a result of his subtle warning. \\'You don\\'t think I should go out with Ryan at all, Zeke?\\' Zeke shrugged.\\' I don\\'t know, I mean, I can\\'t tell you who you should go out with , Kelsi , but I did hear from Cook that Ryan dates a lot of the members daughters during the summer . I wouldn\\'t have thought Ryan to have any game with the ladies but we only really see him and his ego at school …\\' This time Martha sputtered a laugh as she glared at Zeke, who was clearly taking his own frustration with Sharpay out on Kelsi unfairly. The dude just needed to stop. \\' Zeke, shut up,\\' said Martha, not unkindly ,\\' There is no way that I would believe in a million years that Ryan Evans is some kind of playboy with the girls . He isn\\'t that smooth …\\' Zeke opened his palms spread them wide as if saying that was what he had heard. \\'Okay so even Dansforth has more game than Ryan,\\' agreed Zeke,\\' I was trying to look out for Kelsi , wouldn\\'t want her to get hurt by a jerk .\\' Jason handed Martha a disk, added his two cents into the conversation.\\' I think Chad and Taylor have settled into being a couple better now \\' Kelsi wished that she had never brought up the topic of Ryan at all. \\' Thanks, guys, but it\\'s just one date with Ryan ,\\' reassured Kelsi , lightly ,\\' we\\'re not going steady or getting married or anything , I\\'ll be alright .\\' \\'There wouldn\\'t be anything wrong if you did decide to go steady with Ryan \\' \\'Just put on the movie, Martha \\' The group settled into comfortable silence to watch Pretty in Pink though Kelsi couldn\\'t help but compare the romance between Andie and Blaine to the possibility of her and Ryan making her all the more confused. Ryan was hardly the uptight snob and she wasn\\'t from the wrong side of the tracks but it added to her growing anxiety. *******************************Break************************************** While life went on par usual at Lava Springs, Ryan assisted his mother with her last minute prep for the spur of the moment dinner for Vance\\'s visiting guests, as she spoke with Mr. Fulton about arranging for table and chairs to be placed outside of their family wing this evening. Ryan consulted his mother\\'s list including bringing in extra help for double the pay this evening and noted a scrawl about entertainment and the availability of Kelsi and his heart turned over in his chest. He knew she had plans with her friends tonight. \\' I\\'ve arranged to have a grill brought in for tonight ,\\' replied Derby, hands on her hips as she surveyed the family suite with a critical eye,\\' it will be more efficient if we throw together a simple meal on the grill , make it less stuffy .\\' \\'Burgers?\\' \\'Oh no, dear, you know your Father doesn\\'t like barbecue fare,\\' said Derby, pushing a blonde strand of hair behind her ear,\\' I thought grilled steak and salmon, grilled asparagus, and a nice salad \\' \\' These are all Dads friends on the board with him at U of A,\\' noted Ryan , suspiciously ,\\' I didn\\'t think that he did business with them or is this to help my sister help Troy Bolton , Mom ?\\' Derby let out a weary sigh.\\' Your sister seems to genuinely care about Troy,\\' answered his mother, carefully,\\' He\\'s such a nice young man and your father just wants to help …..It\\'s actually rather surprising.\\' Ryan shook his head and handed her back the clipboard. Of course, Dad was all about helping Sharpay get exactly what or who she wanted and he shouldn\\'t be surprised by it. After all, his sister was Daddy\\'s Girl and always would be. \\'Troy has a girlfriend, Mom, and I\\'m surprised that you would encourage Sharpay to go after a guys who is taken \\' Derby was taken aback by her son\\'s remark. \\'Ryan! What has gotten into you, young man? I expect attitude from your sister but not from you …\\' Ryan removed his hat, sighed again, and looked back up at her, ashamed.\\' Sorry, Mom, I didn\\'t mean to …..I think I am just sick and tired of Sharpay always getting everything her way \\' And not giving a damn about me but he didn\\'t vocalize that because Ryan knew his parents loved him too but it was as if was seeing his life in a new perspective and waking him from it. \\'I admit I find Troy to be a nice boy and he might be good for your sister but I certainly wouldn\\'t be encouraging such a thing. It is refreshing that your father wants to help start Troy\\'s college career \\' \\'I know, Mom,\\' Ryan kissed her cheek,\\' do I really need to be present for this thing tonight? I mean, I really don\\'t know sports all that well and it\\'s not as if they want to sign me or anything.\\' \\'Well, I suppose not \\' \\'Ryan, there you are!\\' Sharpay burst out of the house looking fresh and goergous in white capris and a flowy turquoise camisole top,\\' are you trying to back out of tonights dinner party? Why would you do something like that to me? \\' Ryan narrowed his blue eyes suspiciously at her.\\' You don\\'t need me here \\' \\'Oh don\\'t be such a big baby, Ryan, \\'scolded Sharpay, tugging on his arm,\\' Troy needs somebody familiar obviously besides me tonight and that would be you. I\\'ve even talked to the girls and Alicia has agreed to ignore your stupid behavior and be your date tonight.\\' Ryan\\'s blue eyes challenged hers.\\' I don\\'t want to go out with Alicia – she bores me to death! I don\\'t need for you to fix me up, Sis, so you can tell your friend to forget it \\' Derby looked from her son to daughter decided it might be for the best if they handled this on their own without her interference. It really looked as if this was the summer that Ryan was striking out on his own terms and she couldn\\'t be happier. \\' I am just going to speak with Taylor ,\\' Derby turned on her heel heading towards the main entrance of the country club ,\\' Try not to get blood shed on the cement , please \\' Sharpay slapped a hand across her brother\\'s chest, very lightly. \\'I know that you are still pissed at me because of the show but get a grip and do as I say. Alicia is pretty hot and I am doing you a favor here so you just show up tonight and make idle chit chat with Troy for me \\' Ryan batted her hand away, annoyed by her audacity. \\'You all but kicked me out of the show so why should I help you? \\' Sharpay couldn\\'t believe they were still fighting about this matter! She thought they had settled the whole issue days ago and it galled her that Ryan was being so damn stubborn daring to question and challenge her. \\'We\\'re family \\' Ryan snorted.\\' I am not helping you manipulate Troy Bolton, Sis \\' Sharpay looked offended by his suggestion but masked it quickly.\\' It\\'s not manipulating, brother dear, if Troy is interested in me. You don\\'t see him turning down my attention? As for Alicia, give the girl a chance, Ry\\' \\'I just asked Kelsi out on a date so the last thing I need is for you to interfere by throwing your vapid friend at me \\' \\'I am shocked that Kelsi gave you the time of day! Fine, whatever, I don\\'t care if you do your own thing,\\' tossed out Sharpay, ignoring the shaft of hurt by his refusal to help her,\\' you stay out of my way , Ryan, and I will stay out of yours \\' \\'Gladly, sis \\' Ryan was only too happy to walk away .'][Chapter 8] [\"There was a sort of jittery , excited feeling surrounding Kelsi now that she had acknowledged that she had feelings for Ryan , as well as an anxiousness to see him now that a date had been asked, making her pre-occupied as she clocked into work in the kitchen behind Troy and Gabriella . Zeke hollered a hello as he tied on an apron to help on the front lines in the kitchen prep this morning while Martha and Jason were hard at work filling a cart of breakfast items to ready for the new breakfast buffet. It was a busy morning already and it wasn't even 8 a.m. ' Good morning ,' called out Gabriella, looking fresh and lovely in a blue sundress and holding onto her boyfriend's hand ,' oh, it smells delicious in here ' 'Want to share breakfast before work? ' implored Troy, oblivious to the dirty look Zeke directed his way as he clanged the pan down on the stovetop ,' I bet we could get some chocolate chip pancakes ' Gabriella hesitated darting a glance towards the time clock.' Tempting , Troy, but I really need to get changed ,' said a disappointed Gabriella,' I have a water aerobics class to teach in about a half hour and I really need to get out to the pool .' Troy bent to drop a quick kiss on her lips.' Lunch then ' 'I have a late lunch today 'reminded Gabriella,' come on, walk me to the locker room ' 'See you all later ' As the couple exited the kitchen, Kelsi sidled over to Zeke, putting a hand on his shoulder in comfort. She could tell by the grim set on his mouth that he was battling some of his own inner demons and not taking a swipe at Troy must have taken restraint. 'Right, Captain, cause Zeke will serve all ' Jason sent his best friend a sympathetic look. 'Cut him some slack, man, he didn't say anything bad to you or Gabriella ' 'I don't know …..' 'They seem normal,' reassured Kelsi,' I am sure Troy was just being nice to Sharpay the other day, Zeke. Troy does probably just not want to upset Mr. and Mrs. Evans since they have been taking an intrest in him. It wouldn't look good if he was rude to their daughter ' 'I suppose so,' said Zeke,' you want breakfast this morning, Kels? I have to get the griddle going for a couple hundred pancakes as it is so I can fix you right up' 'Maybe just some juice and chocolate pudding 'She had a weakness for chocolate and the homemade chocolate pudding here was excellent. It wasn't out of the box and so yummy. She would be glued to the piano for hours before her first break and the chocolate would give her the extra energy. Martha handed her a juice glass that Jason poured for her from the pitcher . 'So do you have plans with Ryan today? Did he call you last night?' Kelsi took a sip of juice averting her gaze to hide the blush staining her cheeks.' In case you forgot I am working today, Martha, and no, Ryan didn't call. I didn't expect him too. Nothing was really set in stone but I am sure I will see him here eventually ' She refused to be the type of girl who waited by the phone pining away for a guy to call her that may or may not happen. It would be better talking to Ryan in person anyway and Kelsi was much better one on one. She accepted the pudding and spoon then sat down at one of the prep areas to eat her breakfast and work on a new song that had been playing around in her mind lately. It was a playful song, a back and forth duet that was all heart. All around her was the clatter of pans as the staff and her friends prepared for the morning breakfast rush occasionally conversation would drift from the menu to the latest movie playing at the theatre back in town followed by Jason bemoaning the fact that he chose to work rather than play on a traveling baseball team this summer. 'Sharpay may be meaner than a snake but her Mom is awesome,' Chad came into the kitchen with Taylor by his side, an envelope in his hand,' I worked two extra hours last night manning a grill and pouring lemonade and she leaves me a thank you note and a fifty dollar tip this morning which makes up for the caddying hell that family put me through ' Taylor smoothed a stray dark strand of hair that threatened to escape from her orange satin headband as she perused her schedule for the afternoon then slid a warm smile to her rambling boyfriend. Chad got so excitable sometimes but he was cute. 'I admit that Mr. Fulton can be downright scary most days,' replied Taylor looking lovely and efficient in a tailored looking white and orange belted maxi dress and white flats to complete the picture ,' but I have nothing but respect for Mrs. Evans , honey . That woman may dress in designer fashion but she works much more so here than smoozhing with the members here or l lounging in the spa ' ' How can a nice woman like that have the Evil twins ' mocked Chad as Taylor smacked his arm in a warning ,' Tay! What was that for? You know that it's true …' Taylor shot him a warning look. 'Be nice. I admit that Sharpay can be manipulative and a bit much but Ryan hasn't done any of those things ' 'No but he does his sisters bidding ' ' People can change, Chad , ' brought up Kelsi, surprised to be speaking up in Ryan's defense ,' I mean , take me for example , we have all gone to school together since we were little but I don't think none of you ever really tried to be my friend until just last year . I think you should give Ryan a chance like you did me ' Kelsi had always been content being alone in a crowd, as a musician it hadn't bothered her all that much, and Martha had always been her best friend but it had been nice when her world expanded and she found herself with real friends, a part of a group. 'Sorry about that, Kels,' Chad sent her a friendly smile,' but since when did you get on the Ryan Evans bandwagon? I thought you found him to be like a rodent ' 'Probably since she and Ryan bonded over a song and he asked her out on a date 'chimed in Martha, unable to resist enlightening the others on this new happening in their group. Kelsi sighed and bent her head in dismay. 'It's nothing ' Taylor wouldn't hear of it, placed her clipboard on the counter, and jostled her quiet friend. 'Is this true? Because every time I happen to spot you with Ryan, I believe that you are biting his head off like some vicious praying mantis, Kelsi ' Ryan and Kelsi were both passionate artists so this made a whole lot of sense for them to be attracted to each other. Taylor had always sort of thought that Ryan had a little crush on Gabi but him being interested in Kelsi knocked that idea away and she couldn't have been anymore happier about the whole matter . ' Ryan and I had to clear the air , Taylor, and we have done that,' explained Kelsi, simplifying the matter before her friends made it into some huge affair of the heart ,' he did ask me out but that is it . I literally have nothing new to tell you ' 'Well it's high time you got away from behind the piano and dated,' said Taylor, in her firm and blunt manner. She didn't mince words,' Ryan is pretty charming even if he is horrible at math ' 'I can fix you up with a jock; Kels 'contributed Chad, reaching for his apron. 'She likes Ryan, Chad 'volunteered Chase, helpfully. Chad scowled,' you can do better, Kelsi, is all I am saying ' 'Thanks for the advice, guys,' Kelsi took her empty glass and dish to the sink to rinse out,' but there hasn't even been a date yet. Now I've got to get into the dining room and play some boring elevator music for the guests so I will talk to you all later ' Martha and Taylor shared a knowing female look.' She really, really likes Ryan ' **********************************Break*************************************** Kelsi people watched as her hands moved skillfully across the keys of the piano in a medley of songs from Air Supply to keep the tone light while the late rising guests helped themselves to the large breakfast bar while Mr. Fulton did a walk around to make sure all was in order. She couldn't help but notice that when Ryan stepped into the dining room, hands stuffed into the pockets of khaki cargo pants and a turquoise button down shirt, a fedora completed his outfit. She thought he looked like a stylish Indiana Jones or the adventurer from that old Kings Solomon's Mine movie. Either look Kelsi decided was appealing on him. Ryan looked up, noticed her immediately, a lopsided smile crossing his face as he started over towards her before a sunny blonde dressed in an expensive pink sundress stopped him flashing her long eyelashes at him then gave him a coy smile. 'Ryan! Ryan Evans, don't you dare walk on by me ' Ryan groaned, looking furtively around for his sister or Jackie or anyone he could use to deflect Alicia's attention this morning. Unfortunately, they weren't around and he doubted Mrs. Bagwell who was dining nearby would volunteer to help him so he was on his own. 'Morning Alicia' While Ryan was forced to listen to girls hapless chatter and hoping to make an escape quickly to speak with Kelsi, the musician studied them , keenly aware that with their not a hair out of place looks , the stylish outfits, they would have been a stunning , perfect couple . Kelsi switched from the breezy love songs to some intense Dave Matthews as she tried to ignore the annoying, silly feeling in her gut that certainly couldn't be jealousy simply because Ryan was flirting with the gorgeous twit that was Alicia McBain . Or was it the other way around? Alicia was forever a Sharpayette riding on her popularity with her perfect everything though the girl was as vapid and shallow as could be. Kelsi had the misfortune of being asked to tutor Alicia in French class last semester which had made the composer want to scream in utter frustration, she had been forced to listen to insult upon insult from the twit who expected her to do the work for her. Obviously the girl had taken heart on how to be mean from Sharpay still Kelsi was bummed that Ryan seemed awfully chipper talking to the blonde. Crash into you 'murmured Kelsi, under her breath,' yeah, right ' For not being interested into Alicia, Ryan was acting the opposite of that which made Kelsi feel quite small for believing him earlier. She shouldn't let herself be swayed by all of that charm, that devilish look in his sea blue eyes that disarmed her into believing his claims that he actually liked her. Ryan Evans was obviously a rake like in the brooding gothic romances she liked to read or maybe she had been reading too many 0f them lately. Ryan Evans was no Mr. Darcy that was for sure! She certainly couldn't compete with the likes of gorgeous Alicia nor did she want to be some sort of pawn in this summer game of love. While Kelsi was silently lecturing herself out of going out on a date with Ryan, he finally escaped Alicia and walked briskly over to slide onto the bench beside her, startling her. 'Good morning ' Kelsi forced herself to meet his gaze and managed a cool smile.' Morning ' 'Mom made the party a rousing success and impressed all of Dad's business friends,' Ryan brushed his shoulder against hers and felt Kelsi tense up beside him,' but I was bored. I think it wouldn't have been as boring if you had been there with me ...' Kelsi moved easily into another angst ridden tune as she tried to remain aloof. 'Well, you didn't invite me to the party so I can't help you there , Ryan ,' says Kelsi, almost glib,' maybe you should have invited Alicia , I bet she would have been delighted to be your date.' Ryan searched her face, confused by her defensive tone this morning.' Am I missing something, Kelsi ? Are you feeling alright? You're not acting yourself this morning and I feel like you're mad at me again ' Kelsi released the breath that she hadn't been aware that she was holding and tried to get back on track. She didn't even know what Ryan talked about with Alicia and she was probably being stupid and completely irrational for no good reason. What on Earth was wrong with her? Gah! Why was she so suddenly sensitive and ridiculous about Ryan? It was crazy. Kelsi shook her head as she gave him a thin smile.' I'm good,' assured Kelsi, sliding into a smooth jazz piece effortlessly,' I was just surprised to see you talking with Alicia but I shouldn't be since she runs around with your sister.' Ryan made a face of disdain. 'That girl plays games and I won't but she cornered me before I could escape her nefarious clutches. You could have rescued me, Kelsi, and be my hero ' Her brows narrowed as a tiny smile curved around the corners of her mouth. 'The great Ryan Evans needs rescued? You're so confident all of the time, Ryan, I never would have thought of you to even ask for help ' Ryan placed his hand on her wrist feeling the pulse there as her eyes lit up with warmth from his touch. There was no denying that there was clearly magic when they touched and he didn't know why she was suddenly running scared. It had only been a day since he had asked her out on an actually date and they hadn't seen each other since so he knew he hadn't done anything. ' My confidence doesn't extend to man eating shallow girls who have claws and take lessons from my sister ,' said Ryan in a conspirator whisper as if hiding ,' so I was thinking a lot about our date . I thought maybe we could have a picnic on the first tee on the golf course because the view is really pretty there and then going back to my family's suite to watch a movie together.' Picnics were always the epitome of romance and he figured he could put together something sort of fancy and French since Ryan knew that Kelsi loved everything associated with the country. A loaf of fancy bread, some cheese, fruit, sparkling cider, and he could really do it up. 'You mean like the kind of picnic Troy and Gabi got in trouble for having on the course?' Gabriella had been mortified to having been caught and written up for an impromptu picnic on the green with her boyfriend by the stiff lipped Mr. Fulton while Troy had been incensed about the entire incident. Naturally everyone on the staff had all heard about it. 'No, not like that,' insisted Ryan, cursing himself for not remembering that Troy and Gabriella were always doing romantic picnics. It was like the jocks tried and true staple romantic mood but he hadn't figured that Kelsi would compare it,' I was thinking more of an evening picnic after your shift ended. I'm not much of a cook like Zeke but I can do better than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches...what do you say, Kelsi ?' ' I admit I am intrigued by a nighttime picnic , Ryan, but I spend all day and a good portion of my evening working here so not really wanting to spend more time here ' There was a tiny, niggling ball of doubt inside of her that wanted his attention for her to wan while her heart trembled at the prospect of them going out together .She had been content to hang out with just Jason last year because of the safety of their friendship but there was much more than only friendship on the line between her and Ryan which scared her if she was being honest with herself . 'Okay I understand that,' Ryan grew thoughtful, turning an idea around in his head,' what time do you get off work tomorrow night? ' Ryan wanted to be original, but wanted their first date to be romantic and memorable so he could talk her into that second date. An idea was already beginning to form in his mind, he just needed to turn it around a little while, and then make some phone calls. 'I get a break from the supper crowd tomorrow night so I'm off at five 'mumbled Kelsi as Mr. Fulton had been worried about her hours therefor he would be testing out piped in music in the evening as a test of some sort for the club . 'Great, 'beamed Ryan, squeezing her fingers, affectionately,' how about we meet up by the pool after you get changed? Leave the date planning all up to me ' Kelsi hesitated before giving him a shy smile. 'Sounds good to me ' She didn't know what might happen on their date or what tomorrow would bring only that the butterflies were dancing a full on cha cha inside of her with fear and anticipation .\"][Chapter 9] ['Ryan needed help pulling off the perfect first date. After much careful deliberating which including tossing out half a dozen lame ideas, Ryan went back to his original idea. Kelsi wasn\\'t like other girls and he wanted to show her that he paid attention to her and knew or at least had ideas of what she liked or didn\\'t like. He had arranged for the first part of the date without any hitch at all but now he needed some help from the kitchen staff to put it all together for him. The quickest route would have been to let Mr. Fulton arrange it all for him but that felt mainly lazy and not really making the effort himself. He didn\\'t want to take the lazy way out. Squaring his shoulders and hitching in a breath, Ryan strolled into the kitchen where only a handful of the staff were finishing up with the nightly wipe down and cleaning while Zeke got a head start on preparing pastries for the morning breakfast rush. Removing his hands from the pockets of his shorts then adjusting his fedora on his head, the dancer made his way over to the large table where Zeke was working rolling out dough, a look of deep concentration on his face, as he studied the thinness of the dough. \\'Hey \\' Zeke straightened as he gave him a slight nod. \\'Ryan, what brings you in here? Room service because technically this kitchen is closed unless you want leftovers …I\\'m kind of busy working on the fine art of the pastry \\'No, I wouldn\\'t bother you for a snack,\\' replied Ryan, hesitating,\\' I can help myself for that but I do actually...that is I was hoping you could help me out with something special for tomorrow evening \\' Zeke narrowed his eyes. \\'For your date with Kelsi \\' \\'You know about that, eh,\\' replied Ryan, feeling as if Zeke was somehow judging him and he was coming up short. He wasn\\'t all that sure he liked how that felt but put it aside,\\' it\\'s our first date so I really want to do it right. Originally we were going to see an old movie together but I had to help my Mother instead so I really want to do this date right by Kelsi \\' \\'We all know about it,\\' told Zeke, not unkindly,\\' was it supposed to be some sort of secret? Kelsi has only mentioned it a half a dozen times already so pretty sure that she is nervous about this date .\\' Zeke suddenly felt protective of his friend and wanted to let Ryan know the score. He didn\\'t figure Ryan had much game with the girls but he had the charm thing going for him which meant Kelsi could get hurt. He didn\\'t know if an Evans could be trusted. Or maybe he was just projecting his own hurt by Sharpay onto this new Ryan and Kelsi thing that was happening in front of their own faces, it stung. \\' No, no secret ,\\' Ryan shrugged his shoulders then glanced furtively as if expecting his sister to be spying on him this late at night ,\\' I\\'m planning a romantic night picnic for us and was hoping you could help me put together a meal for us . I was thinking very American in Paris because I know how much Kelsi is into all that French stuff ….\\' One of the perks of having lockers side by side was that Ryan often observed Kelsi talking to the girls which gave him some pretty good insight into her. He also knew she was the star pupil in French class and loved everything from the language to the delicate French cuisine. He figured it would be too over the top to fly her to Paris for a date, not to mention that his Dad would probably shoot that idea down immediately. On the other hand, Kelsi might think that he was showing off his wealth and not be impressed at all therefor squashing the thought of ever going out with him ever again . Ryan sure as hell didn\\'t want that to happen either. \\'An American in Paris? Dude, I don\\'t know what that is but you don\\'t think you can throw together picnic foods by yourself because that is pathetic \\' Ryan threw up his hands in the air and let out his own disgusted sound of his own. \\' I didn\\'t think fancy bread and cheese alone would impress her and I can\\'t do something lame like peanut butter and jelly or Kelsi will think I\\'m borrowing the damn idea from Troy Bolton . \\' Zeke rolled his eyes upwards at the mention of Troy. \\'Bolton isn\\'t the damn king of romance or anything. Kelsi likes strawberries by the way …if you didn\\'t already know that.\\' \\' I didn\\'t but thanks ,\\' replied Ryan, rubbing his hands together ,\\' Look I already got some sparkling French soda , a baguette and cheese is easy enough , but I was hoping you could maybe make something special , Zeke . I, uh, I could pay you for your time and the extra work …like a caterer \\' Zeke considered. He liked the idea of being a caterer even if he wasn\\'t sure how he felt about Ryan\\'s interest in Kelsi but figured it wasn\\'t his place to decide one way or the other. Still Kelsi was his friend and he wanted to look out for her. \\'Can I ask you something, Evans, and you\\'ll be cool with me about it? \\' \\'Sure,\\' answered Ryan, leaning against the counter casually and putting an elbow in some flour that had gotten away from the cutting board,\\' shoot \\' \\'You having a thing with any of those little hotties that hangs with your sister? I mean, I know you have a few groupies ,\\' Zeke made a face at the words coming out of his mouth but hell, what else would you call the types that fawned all over the theatre twins ,\\' and it is the summer , your folks own this place, so do you take advantage of that fact or not ? \\' Ryan didn\\'t know if he should be pissed off or flattered by the question. \\'No, I am not having a thing with any of them. Alicia and I went out a few times before but there was nothing there at all and that is all there is to that. My God, does everyone think I am such a jerk? \\' He noticed the flour, lifted his arm, and wiped it off on a nearby towel.\\' My own sister thinks I am nothing but her personal lap dog, Alicia thought I was some magical damn key to Sharpay\\'s inner circle and that I would buy her riches or something, and because I just kind of follow the lead, you think …..And Kelsi thought it too. I am not my sister, I am me! \\' It really ticked him off and Ryan knew that he was just going to work harder to be a different kind of guy, one who was his own man, with his own thoughts and feelings and to hell, with bowing down to his sister. If there was a twinge of disloyalty, he pushed it away. Zeke tossed his chef\\'s hat aside then studied Ryan. He looked as if he was wrestling with his own inner demons and the baker couldn\\'t detect malice in the dancers tone of voice, Ryan sounded real to him. He trusted his instinct. \\'You kind of make it easy for us to go there, man,\\' admitted Zeke, crossing his arms over his chest,\\' I don\\'t want to think you\\'re the worse either. It\\'s hard to when I see your sister all over Troy as if they are the next big thing and now you\\'re trying to sweet talk Kelsi ….it\\'s a lot \\' \\'I genuinely care about Kelsi ,\\' swore Ryan , meeting and holding the bakers gaze ,\\' I\\'m not lying or playing stupid games . I don\\'t understand what Sharpay is doing with Troy, I know that you like her, Zeke, and I am truly sorry if she is causing you any pain \\' Zeke gripped the rolling pin tighter in his hands resisting the urge to toss it across the kitchen. He wasn\\'t one of those high strung chefs like on those cooking shows and he didn\\'t want to start acting like one now. Besides this was a primo dream job and Zeke didn\\'t want to risk it. \\'Yeah, it sucks,\\' acknowledged Zeke, taking a chance in confiding in Ryan,\\' I just know that deep down there is this other sweet side to your sister, not just the diva that she shows everyone on a daily basis. I was hoping Sharpay and I would move past two word sentences this summer ….i shouldn\\'t have taken that out on you .\\' Ryan clamped a hand on his shoulder in sympathy.\\' It\\'s deep down, Zeke and right now Sharpay doesn\\'t care about me or you or anything but being the other half a couple with Troy.\\' \\'Gabriella doesn\\'t seem too threatened about the whole thing but it\\'s bugging the hell out of me, man \\' Ryan rubbed his chin, contemplating.\\' Since I really don\\'t have any sort of track record with the ladies, I don\\'t know if you want to listen to me at all, Zeke, but keep getting in Shar\\'s face and make her see you. Sharpay isn\\'t as blind as she pretends to be about things.\\' \\'You aren\\'t just telling me that to get me to help you with your date with Kelsi \\' \\' No,\\' stated Ryan , deciding not to be offended by the question,\\' if you don\\'t want to help me, I\\'ll just come up with the rest of the menu by myself or I could have our picnic basket put together by the chefs at the French restaurant back in town ….\\' Zeke shook his head.\\' That\\'s overkill , Ryan ,\\' decided Zeke , making up his mind to help the dude out ,\\' If you stick around until I get these Danish in the oven, you can help me make a fresh strawberry mousse that way you can tell Kelsi that you made it for her .\\' A wide grin spread across Ryan\\'s face in gratitude. \\'That is great. Thanks a lot, Zeke.\\' \\' Roll up those sleeves, Ryan, \\' tossed back Zeke, with a wide grin on his handsome face,\\' I\\'m helping you out here , not going to make the mousse for you myself because that would be cheating .\\' Dutifully, Ryan did as he was told.\\' I\\'m not completely helpless in the kitchen, I passed home ec \\' Zeke snorted,\\' you\\'re not so bad, Evans \\' ***********************************Summer************************************ It was date night and Kelsi found her much more nervous than she expected to be as she went about work par usual entertaining the lunch crowd with a new set list that had been provided by Mrs. Evans which included tunes from Broadway to hits 0f the 1970\\'s and the 80\\'s . It was unusual but at least it wasn\\'t all easy listening music that would put her to sleep. A tip jar had been provided for her out of blue which sort of surprised the composer as she thought it would look kind of tacky at a ritzy country club that was Lava Springs but Mr. Fulton assured her it was above board coming from the higher ups. Amazingly people were being quite generous! She was seguing into Higher Love when Zeke who was making rounds with refilling bread baskets swung around by her leaning in closer to speak with her privately. In the fancy white chef hat and jacket, Zeke looked every inch the confident baker that she knew her friend to be . However odd it was to see him out of the kitchen as the chef had taken him under his wing and had been teaching him more tools of the trade. \\'Hi Kels\\' \\'Hey, how did you manage to escape the kitchen? Jason bribe you to switch with him? \\' It was no secret that Jason absolutely hated the serving part of his job and would even take washing dishes and rolling silverware to delivering food to the guest. Despite being graceful on the basketball court, Jason was also on the side of a klutz which Kelsi could relate too . Zeke shrugged.\\' Naw, I stayed over last night to help Chef out so he\\'s cutting me some slack today. He thought I needed fresh air not from the kitchen …\\' Kelsi laughed at then then nodded towards the dining area which had a good crowd for this early afternoon. Normally the breakfast crowd was hopping as guests liked to linger over their morning coffees as they made plans for their day over homemade scones and quiche. The lunch crowd tended to be scattered though not today it appeared. \\'Quiet crowd put here today\\' \\'Well, I think we\\'re serving folks by the pool this afternoon,\\' told Zeke,\\' we had a memo \\' \\'Well I am thankful I don\\'t have to play outside is all I can say about that \\'laughed Kelsi who had so far managed to evade being at Sharpay\\'s beck and call here as she spotted Mr. Fulton enter the dining room, \\' uh oh here comes Fulton \\' \\'Crap \" \\'Ms. Nielsen, Mr. Baylor, is there a problem that somehow connects the kitchen to the entertainment area? I do not believe we have a new supply of bread hiding in the piano \\'replied a tense Mr. Fulton, straightening his green pinstriped tie even as he thumbed an antacid,\\' please don\\'t give me a reason to write the two of you up .\\' Kelsi looked visibly chagrined.\\' Sorry, we were just talking for a few minutes \\' \\'Back to the kitchen,\\' Zeke started to back trek, \\'hey if I don\\'t see you later, Kelsi, have a good date tonight with Ryan \\' Kelsi wanted to cover her face with her hands in embarrassment but somehow managed a tiny nod as Zeke disappeared back into the kitchen. She lifted her head up higher preparing herself for a hard lecture from the manager and somehow managed to continue playing the song. \\' Oh do relax, young lady , \\' tossed out the stuffy manager as he fiddled with the cuff links on his sleeves of his navy blue jacket ,\\' Mr. Ryan has his dear mothers disposition and leaves me be to do my job as I see fit . You give me no trouble either so that is all I will say on the matter \\' He gave her a curt nod then went off to check in at the desk leaving the pianist to herself and relieved. She knew all of her friends were aware of her date with Ryan this evening but it would have been mortifying if Mr. Fulton had lectured her or fired her over a date. Kelsi understood he had been unusually harsh with Troy and Gabriella for their impulsive dates on the country clubs grounds which she though had been uncalled for on both accounts and she knew Tay and Chad had gotten a lecture on PDA in the dang kitchen , of all places . Kelsi just wanted to survive the day and not freak out over the date part! *****************************************Summer ********************* \\'Tonight is the night \\' Taylor\\'s eyes gleamed mischievously as she teased her friend as they refilled their iced teas in the corner drink station while they were on their breaks. Kelsi took a long drink of sweet tea as she felt her friends gaze boring holes directly into her own. \\'Is there a memo on my date with Ryan, Taylor? I swear that is all anybody can talk about,\\' groused an uncomfortable Kelsi, leaning against the counter,\\' I\\'m going to get a...a complex before we even go out. I mean, it\\'s a first date, and we might not have a thing in common and it could be a huge awkward mistake …\\' Taylor put down her clipboard turning her attention back to her friend laying a sympathetic hand on her arm. It sounded like the entire gangs excitement and expectations for Kelsi were having the opposite effect on what they had hoped for their shy friend. \\'No memo, I swear,\\' said Taylor, all serious,\\' we\\'re all just really excited for you is all. Ryan is a nice guy. \\'Realizing how lame her pep talk was sounding, Taylor made a little noise in the back of her throat.\\' No offense to Gabi but I was sounding an awfully a lot like her just then when she was listing positive reasons that my dating Chad was a good idea \\' It had been solid advice but it also drove Taylor up the wall – all logic and sense aside, when it came to dating. She expected all the romance a girl could handle and at that time, Taylor wasn\\'t even sure if Chad knew the meaning of the word. Lord knows the guy had entirely different ideas on what signified romance but what she and Chad had was good. It was real. He was laid back and carefree while Taylor made lists and had very direct notions of what she wanted and expected but together, they fit. Kelsi giggled,\\' You are sounding like her \\' \\'Look don\\'t listen to us,\\' Taylor changed her line of tactic,\\' we don\\'t know anything about romantic entanglements. You and Ryan have always talked easily enough so just go out with him and have a lot of fun \\' \\'It\\'s just a date not a lifelong commitment …it\\'ll be fine \\' Kelsi just hoped that she wouldn\\'t chicken out before then and decide not to go. *****************************Summer ************************************* The rest of the afternoon was a blurr of activity as a last minute birthday party for a well to do member of the club had all hands on deck which including Mr. Fulton enlisting Kelsi\\'s help with helping Taylor set a few fancy tables and arrange flowers leaving the music to the piped in sound system for the time being. She hoped it wouldn\\'t replace her. Taylor straightened a fork on the crisp white napkin then caught sight of the time on her watch. \\' Kelsi, you need to go change like now or you are going to be late for your own date \\' \\' Arg! I don\\'t want to get in trouble for just leaving …\\' Taylor waved a hand at her.\\' Go already and I\\'ll explain. I am positive it is fine.\\' Kelsi made a beeline for the girl\\'s locker room; the butterflies dancing around her stomach, as she changed out of her work clothes into what she hoped looked really nice for a date. Ryan hadn\\'t given her a clue as to what they were doing or where they were going so Kelsi had decided on a simple turquoise dress with a sparkly silver belt and a pair of sparkly heeled sandals she\\'d found in a bin at the thrift shop for three dollars . She brushed out her curls, thankful that her hair was growing pretty fast already, added a touch of barely there lip gloss and considered herself date ready. Kelsi stuffed everything into her oversized bag, took a deep, cleansing breath, let it out, and then strolled back outside to meet with Ryan. \\'Cute shoes, Kels\\' called out Gabriella from poolside where she was busily cleaning the pool for the next day. No rest for the wicked or the lifeguard,\\' have an awesome time tonight \\' \\'I will \\' Kelsi was halfway across the parking lot when Ryan stepped out of the family wing caught her eye and approached her. He looked really good in navy slacks, a short sleeve buttoned down shirt, and a blue and white patterned cap that somehow exuded confidence. Ryan lifted his cap to take her all in finding himself not at all eloquent.\\' Wow,\\' stuttered Ryan,\\' I mean, wow, you look wow. I\\'ve always thought you look cute normally but seeing you all doled up like this is just wow \\' Kelsi blushed all the way to the tips of her toes.\\' Thanks. You look good too \\' \\'Um I didn\\'t know what I should wear because I didn\\'t know where we were going \\'stammered Kelsi , adjusting the glasses that slid down on her nose absently ,\\' I brought my bag since I figured you were going to drive me home later \\' Ryan took her bag from her and tossed it in the back of the family BMW.\\' Do you mind a short walk? If not I can grab a golf cart for us …..\\' Kelsi sent him a querulous look as Ryan reached for her hand to hold.\\' I don\\'t mind walking but I thought we talked about this not being at the country club. I get that it\\'s like your summer home, Ryan, but this is still just a workplace to me.\\' \\'Don\\'t worry, the date itself isn\\'t on the grounds but we do need to go out to the course to be picked up, Kelsi \\'He swung her hand and was relieved that she didn\\'t let go ,\\' Trust me \\' Curiosity gleamed bright in her eyes as she pondered his words.\\' Picked up …like in your Dad\\'s helicopter? \\' Ryan made a face as he shook his head leading her to the golf course farther up.\\' Uh, first, Dad would not let me borrow his personal helicopter even if I begged so and second, I had something else in mind for us \\' \\' You really don\\'t see eye to eye with your Dad \\' realized Kelsi and somehow that made Ryan all the more real and human to her , flawed like the rest of them were and it was alright . \\' Let\\'s just say my Father has a few very definitive ideas about who and what his son is and should be doing ,\\' explained Ryan, trying to keep the edge of bitterness from his tone of voice ,\\'I have no desire to be a jock or a business major \\' \\' I\\'m sorry about all of that but you are a wonderful dancer \\' admitted Kelsi , softly,\\' though I don\\'t need to tell you that as judging by that ego of yours, you are fully aware of it .\\' Ryan gave her a little tug, pulling her closer.\\' You know when you aren\\'t all being shy and brilliant, you are quite sassy, Kelsi \\' \\' I can stand up for myself \\' murmured Kelsi with a throaty laugh as she looked over his shoulder spotting a large wicker basket with a colorful oversized bright balloon awaiting them on the course ,\\' oh my God !What is a hot air balloon doing on the green ? \\' \\'It\\'s for us, of course,\\' said Ryan, his mouth stretching into a smile around the corners,\\' it\\'s still early enough for a balloon ride. Are you game? Martha didn\\'t think you were afraid of heights so I thought it could be fun for us to fly the skies …up, up and away \\' He gestured nervously at the pilot.\\' Pete is our pilot and we won\\'t be gone long …..Please say something, Kelsi, before I start sounding like an idiot \\' \\'Up, up and away in my beautiful balloon,\\' Kelsi reached up to give him an impulsive hug,\\' this is so incredibly cool! I really should tell you that it\\'s too much except it\\'s the sweetest, most romantic gesture anyone has ever done for me \\' \\'I\\'m glad you\\'re happy \\' Ryan held her a moment longer than necessary before approaching the pilot.\\' Are we all set, Sir? \\' The pilot from the balloon service gave them the basic run through of what their trip would entail then helped them into the wicker basket before pulling the cord that would carry them up into the sky. As they floated up into the sky high above the country club drifting to the sprawling desert mesa and the Sandia Mountains, Kelsi relaxed for the first time just soaking it all in, pink lips curving into a small smile as she held onto Ryan\\'s arm. \\'This is just incredible like a walk in the clouds \\' A grin spread across his lips as he looked deeply in her soulful eyes and the warmth that he found displayed there. He was really glad that he had followed his gut on this ride. Ryan moved closer to her then lifted a hand to brush at an errant brown curl. \\' That sounds very lyrical , Kelsi,\\' replied Ryan as they drifted further away from the club , the tightness in his chest loosening up and all of the expectations put on him by his parents and his twin didn\\'t seem to matter anymore ,\\' I was hoping you would find this romantic even if it\\'s a little bit much for a first date. I couldn\\'t quite get away with flying you to Paris for a romantic dinner date ….\\' Kelsi fixed him with a stern look.\\' Now that would have been overkill, Ryan \\' \\'I had a feeling that you would say that \\'allowed Ryan, draping his arm oh so casual over her shoulders,\\' everything looks far away from up here; it\\'s just us and the clouds. It\\'s sort of a freeing kind of feeling …..Almost like a freefall \\' Kelsi took a minute to study Ryan looking past the fact that he looked every bit as handsome like a cover of GQ magazine that always had the perfect and preppy looking male models. Ryan\\'s chin was just a bit sharper than the rest of his features appealing to her and she had to hold back her impulsive streak to resist removing his hat to muss him up a bit. \\'Why do I get the feeling you\\'re not exactly having fun on your vacation? \\' Ryan gave a careless shrug of his shoulders before looking back down at her. \\'How is it that we\\'ve known each other since kindergarten, share a few classes together, our lockers are literally neighbors, and suddenly it\\'s like you know what I am thinking?\" Kelsi felt a blush creeping up her face and pressed her lips together.\\' Maybe because we never really talked, I don\\'t know, but do we have to analyze it? Can\\'t we just talk and be together without making things weird between us ? \\' Things were going so well that Ryan didn\\'t want to risk putting a jinx on them. Kelsi wasn\\'t moving away from him nor did she seem to mind his arm around her which was all good as far as the dancer was concerned. \\'Did you say for, um, us to be together? \\' Her pink lips curved ever so softly.\\' You caught that, eh? \\' \\'I like the sound of that \\' \\'I think I do too,\\' murmured Kelsi, teasingly as she reached for his cap, plopping it on her own head then lifted a hand to mess up his blonde hair,\\' there, much better \\' Ryan\\'s blue eyes sparked as he pulled her into an embrace, holding her against his chest, feeling as if it was the most natural thing in the world between them, the past fading away until there were only the two of them and their rising hearts against the wind. \\'You\\'re a funny girl, Kelsi \\' \\'You look good like that, not all polished up and perfect \\' \\'You\\'d be the only one to feel that way about me \\' Feeling bold and a bit daring, Kelsi flipped open a button on his shirt, pretending to smooth out the collar as she patted at it . She felt the thundering of his heart beneath her palm and wasn\\'t sure if it weren\\'t his or her hearts a racing as she let out the softest of sighs. \\'I like the Ryan that I am with right now \\' The air crackled around them along with words not yet spoken as Ryan gently cupped the back of her neck with his hand, feathering his fingers against her jaw, before lowering his lips to hers into a deliriously tender kiss that spun out and around them. Kelsi never thought that she would fall in love and couldn\\'t catch her breath back knowing that she had irrevocably, hopelessly, crazily fell at this very moment in time in the sweep of the fluffy clouds and in the arms of Ryan Evans .'][Chapter 10] [\"The balloon touched down amid Wildflower Park where a large red blanket and basket sat amidst the colorful, desert flowers as the balloon wrangler assisted them out of the basket then proceeded to ground it until the next time. A quick sideways glance showed Ryan that the BMW had been already been delivered by Fulton for when the date was over. 'That was such an incredible ride,' muttered Kelsi as Ryan took her hand to help her from the basket,' the view was so breathtaking. The girls will be so envious when I tell them ….' ' Good ,' said Ryan, leading her to the blanket ,' well, good unless their respective boyfriends get angry at me for setting the dating curve ' He rubbed his chin, thoughtfully ,' if there is such a thing as a dating curve . I know there are codes about being bros but I've never actually gotten the gist of them …..' Kelsi couldn't hold back the laugh that bubbled up and didn't try to either.' I think this is the first time I've ever heard you babble like a normal person, Ryan. As for the guy codes, I have no idea but I am sure that you could ask one of the guys and they would enlighten you.' 'I was trying to impress you. Did it work? ' Kelsi blushed then squeezed his hands.' I think you're doing just fine, Ryan ' They settled together on the blanket and Ryan began pulling out food for their feast including the baguette, cheese, dried fruit, cold roasted chicken, and strawberry mousse. Ryan also produced a bottle of Italian Soda, a bottle of French sparkling soda, and two plastic cups. 'I know that you were kind of, I don't know how you were when I mentioned us having a picnic but I thought it went with the balloon ride. I honestly wasn't trying to copy off what Troy Bolton does,' replied Ryan as he poured the sparkling soda in a glass for her,' I don't pay that much attention to him. I did however make the strawberry mousse – well, Zeke helped me because that isn't something I have ever made before in Home Ec class ' Why did he get all twisted up around Kelsi ? He considered himself a confident sort of man but lately, he found himself turned into a blithering fool when his thoughts turned to caring for the pretty pianist. He raked a hand through his blonde hair making it spikier and offered her a plate figuring that offering to fix it for her wouldn't appeal to her. Kelsi was an independent girl. 'I love strawberries,' confessed Kelsi, her eyes sparkling behind the frames of her glasses,' I can't believe Zeke taught you how to make this mousse for me. It's really sweet, Ryan ' It was also unexpected and Kelsi couldn't help but to wonder how much more there was to Ryan than what she thought she knew. She had been nervous and anxious all week for this date, one part of her had debated about chickening out and cancelling and now Kelsi felt wonderfully swept 0ff of her feet. 'I try ' 'Did you make the chicken too? ' ' No but to be fair , Zeke was a very demanding teacher and I was busy ,' Ryan flashed her a sheepish grin that made her laugh at him ,' I bribed the chef to make it for me but Mom okay'd the man an extra day off so it's all good .' 'You could have brought us box lunches and I would have still thought it sweet,' admitted Kelsi, nibbling on a bite of the cheese,' I've got to tell you I've never had anyone go to this much trouble for me. Not that I date so much …..now I'm babbling ' 'You're a cute babbler ' Kelsi ducked her head to hide the color rising up to her face but Ryan tipped her face up so he could brush a light kiss across her mouth. She sighed smiling through the kiss. 'Ryan, how is this going to work between us? I hate drama ….and you're a drama major ,' rattled off a nervous Kelsi, cutting right through to the heart of the issue ,' I mean I am a musician and we both do spend a lot of the time in the theatre except that its summer and we're on vacation . I don't want everybody to know all of our private business …not that I think we are anything torrid. Oh God, make me shut up!' Ryan took her hands into his own, gently rubbing his thumb over hers in a reassuring gesture. ' I'm happy that your already thinking of us as a couple cause I was afraid I couldn't talk you into a second date ,' answered Ryan , gnawing on his lower lip,' I am pretty sure the whole secret dating thing wouldn't work for us since all of your friends know about us already . Do you want us to fight in private? ' 'Well, it sounds silly when you say it like that ' 'How about we just spend time together and go from there 'suggested Ryan, not wanting to analyze this date at all. He could probably wind up either complicating something simple or making it worse,' I mean, I am not aspiring for us to be some sort of power couple or anything. We don't need to impress anyone …..Right?' Kelsi fixed him with a rather withering look.' Why would you even ask me that? ' Ryan shrugged as he tore off a hunk of bread.' I can be stupid so why don't we forget this whole ridiculous conversation and talk about something else. Did you know I play the ukele ? I do a decent take on Somewhere over the Rainbow and some sixties tunes from old beach movies.' It was random but then they didn't really know all that much about each other and he definitely wanted to know more about her. He figured he barely knew enough to scratch the surface of Kelsi Nielsen but that would change soon. Kelsi nibbled at the sandwich that she had put together as she listened intently to him. ' Ukele ? Hmm, interesting but why haven't you ever tried out for orchestra or band? ' 'I can play the ukele but I'm not that good,' admitted Ryan with a shrug,' Fact is I'm more comfortable in the theatre onstage. I know Sharpay and I are considered a triple threat talent wise but I've been thinking a lot lately about maybe just focusing on my dancing …I have killer dance moves ' Ryan had been studying all of the great musicals of all times especially the choreography considering it a possibility of breaking into something new. Something more, rather than just being second fiddle performer to his sister. Mentioning it to Kelsi made it seem more real. ' I think you should dance then and let Sharpay worry about her own life for a change,' says Kelsi then bit her lip as she realized what she had just said ,' Sorry, I know she is your sister but it doesn't mean you always have to be joined at the hip, Ryan ' Ryan played with her fingers as he waited for the anger to come and was surprised that it didn't come. Maybe he was really growing and changing this summer. 'I'm not mad. I think I am figuring that one all by myself,' replied an earnest Ryan ,' it's way past time for me to make some changes in my life , take charge of it . Okay, your turn, Kelsi, how about your favorite color? ' 'Ivory ' Ryan gaped at her.' Ivory? Seriously, for real, ivory is your favorite color? ' 'Well, yes, but I like peach too ' 'I never would have guessed either of those colors,' said Ryan, shaking his head,' I mean, you're always decked out in bright colors like me. I would have gone with red or maybe green but never ivory and peach …. I like that you're unpredictable.' Kelsi just grinned at him. ' I could say the same about you as I don't think I've ever seen you in the same outfit more than once ' Ryan wagged a finger, playfully at her.' Aha but you have because I am hardly as obsessive as my sister. Can we please stop bringing my twin into this? Since we are playing twenty questions , I prefer turquoise blue .' 'Well turquoise does go with your blue eyes ' 'So, you know what color my eyes are,' replied Ryan, the picnic forgotten as he moved closer to hold Kelsi in his arms, 'I wish we had talked like this in school, we might have gotten here sooner ' 'We did run in different circles besides Ms. Darbus drama class ' Kelsi snuggled in closer, as he enfolded her in his arms.' Or the time wasn't right for us, Ryan, until now. Call me a dreamer but I'd like to think that fate brought us together ' Ryan didn't care if it was fate, God, or the stressed out pianist that had quit Lava Springs opening up the job for Kelsi, he couldn't have been happier than he was now . This was their own start of something new and they fit beautifully .\"][Chapter 11] ['Change was in the air and too many of the friends working at Lava Springs, it shook up their summer as well as perceptions of what they thought they knew. While it appeared that Sharpay was even more of a barracuda outside of school scheming not so secretly to hook her perfectly pink manicured nails into Troy, but the unexpected job promotion to Troy was turning the jock into a person no one, not even his best friend Chad, recognized. Gabriella, ever the trusting girlfriend, seemed to be taking things in stride though her friends expected that wouldn\\'t last long knowing a meltdown was coming in the near future. So witnessing the new romance of Ryan and Kelsi right before their eyes rattled more than a few within the group of friends of East High School . Kelsi arrived an hour early to work to meet Ryan for a morning date. She was trying to work past her own insecurities besides she and Ryan had set some ground rules to follow regarding the country club that they both felt were fair and reasonable. She liked Ryan and that was that. She found a small table in a quiet corner as Kelsi waited for Ryan, pausing to fiddle with the napkin then takes a sip of water when Taylor, who had been refilling her coffee cup, spotted her and grinning, swung over to pay a visit to her friend. \\'Good morning, Kelsi,\\' greeted Taylor, sliding into the empty chair across from her then fixed her with an inquiring look,\\' you look chipper this morning but aren\\'t you a little early for work? I\\'m giving club tours this morning with a group visiting from Roswell so what is your excuse?\\' Taylor, much like Martha, could always cut right through to the truth without batting a perfect eyelash. It would be annoying if Kelsi wasn\\'t in such a good mood this morning. \\'Roswell? Wish I could be in that group,\\' admitted Kelsi, a bonafide UFO enthusiast,\\' you know I still haven\\'t saved enough to go to the UFO Convention there. Not that I could convince any of you narrow minded folks to go with me …..\\' She couldn\\'t resist the teasing then grew serious.\\' Oh, don\\'t give me that look, Taylor, you brought up Roswell. I\\'m not avoiding either; Ryan is meeting me for a breakfast date.\\' Taylor let out a much unsophisticated squeal of delight, a grin tugging around her lips. \\'Oh my gosh! So are you and Ryan like an item now? \\' A slight blush warmed the composers face as she nodded.\\' Ryan and I are dating, yes, but I don\\'t want to be the topic of gossip central, Taylor.\\' Taylor folded her hands together, the picture of a serious young woman contemplating this as she would a matter of the student council. Being with Chad had loosened her up and she wasn\\'t so strict and unbending of other views than her own these days which was nice change of pace for her. \\'You and Ryan coupling up is much happier gossip than this weirdness with Troy and Sharpay lately, Hun,\\' informed Taylor in a quiet manner,\\' you might as well accept it. Gabi is still in trusting denial so that nothing I can say to her gets through that genius brain of hers …..\\' It bothered her, the whole messy debacle with Troy, Sharpay, and Gabriella, and her attempts at offering input /suggestions was met with firm resolute from her best friend. On top of that, her own boyfriend was alternately upset and angry with his best friend whom he didn\\'t recognize. Taylor was afraid it might get ugly before it got better. \\'Troy wouldn\\'t cheat on Gabriella,\\' says a stunned Kelsi, who fervently believed in her friends true love,\\' Maybe he is, I don\\'t know, blinded by all of the attention \\' Taylor snorted in a very un-ladylike way.\\' Blinded alright \\' Ryan came up beside Kelsi , placing a hand on her shoulder and smiling at Taylor . \\'Am I interrupting? \\' Kelsi gazed up at him.\\' Hi Ryan \\' Taylor let out a long suffering sigh.\\' Hello, Ryan, and nope just girl talk. I should get back to work anyway before the bus of Roswellians arrive ….i need to be there to greet them \\' Taking her cooled down coffee with her, the ever efficient Taylor rose and with her clipboard in hand, headed outside to greet the tour bus. Ryan bent down to press a kiss to Kelsi\\'s lips then slid across in the vacated seat, his sky blue eyes intense on her pretty face. \\'Sorry I\\'m late,\\' apologized Ryan, reaching for her hand to hold,\\' Dad picked this morning to want to talk. I got invited to tag along with him, Troy Bolton, and half of the U of A players this afternoon ...\\' He made a disgruntled face ,\\' My Father supports our interests but one part of him wishes I had aspirations to be a sports hero like he was in high school .\\' Ryan didn\\'t mind sports, he had even played on a few teams of baseball when he was younger before they moved to New Mexico but he preferred performing better. He was a dancer. It was in his blood and the more he really thought of what made him tick, he realized he wanted to pursue it more. Maybe choreography was his true calling. \\'I thought you mentioned that your Dad wanted you to be a business major \\' \\'Both have been mentioned to me before,\\' admitted Ryan, giving her hand a squeeze,\\' but enough about my Dad. What were you and Taylor talking about? \\' \\' Us , I mean, you and me as an us ,\\' answered Kelsi, softly ,\\' then this whole weirdness going on between your sister and Troy. Taylor is afraid Gabriella\\'s going to get hurt again but I am really hopeful in my belief that Troy is wholly madly in love with Gabriella and has only lost his mind this summer with all the new job perks .\\' Kelsi thought of Troy as the brother that she always wanted and trusted in him to do the right thing even if his actions seemed sort of shady right now. Gabriella was the sweetest, most trusting and well, she was constantly inspired by their love and hated Sharpay\\'s interference in their relationship . \\'I could try to talk to Shar about her little scheme with Troy but truthfully, I doubt she will listen to a word a say. We aren\\'t exactly getting along this summer \\' It was starting to feel as if they were from separate planets lately, separate worlds. A waitress came out of the kitchen to take their orders; Ryan had a bagel with cream cheese, coffee heavy on the cream and sugar, and a poached egg while Kelsi opted for a bowl of strawberries, scrambled eggs, half a bagel, and hot herbal tea. Conversation took on a lighter tone as they discussed their shared interests in UFO\\'s, aliens, and all things Roswell as they finished their breakfast making plans for a day trip together in the nearby future . A look at the clock reminded Kelsi that she needed to clock in and start work. \\'This was fun but I have to go to work now …\\' Kelsi was reluctant to leave his company but knew it wouldn\\'t be responsible to blow off work either,\\' thanks for breakfast \\' \\'You\\'re welcome,\\' Ryan stood,\\' want to meet for lunch by the pool? \\' \\'Yes but I have a late lunch today, \\'muttered Kelsi,\\' it\\'s not until 2:00\\' \\'Two it is \\' Kelsi leaned in, placing her hands on either side of his shoulders, brushed her lips over his in the sweetest of kisses then with a wave, the composer dashed off towards the kitchen leaving a grinning Ryan alone at the table. Maybe he would go lounge and hang out by the pool with the new issue of Variety until his girl had her lunch break. He couldn\\'t believe that they both were something of alien enthusiasts- just another thing that they had in common. Roswell was only a few hours from here and they could hit all of the hot spots together – he should find Taylor and the tour group coming in from Roswell and see if he could get some recommendations from them. Ryan signed his name on the credit card receipt for their breakfast then threw down a decent tip before heading out the double doors and onto the pool area when his sister stepped out blocking his path, all dressed to the nines in a black and white sleek dress, an angry line splashed across her glossy pink lips as her hands went to her hips. \\'Have you lost your mind? You\\'re really dating Kelsi Nielsen,\\' said an affronted Sharpay , anger boiling within her at his disregard for her feelings . He was her own twin, for God\\'s sake,\\' we talked about this, Ryan, and I thought you understood how bad this would be \\' Ryan held his ground, his own gaze steely.\\' Sis, you have no say in which I choose to date nor do I have to take orders from you. I like Kelsi therefor we are seeing each other so you might as well get used to the idea, Sharpay\\' Sharpay stepped back as if he had slapped her.\\' What has gotten into you? We are twins, we work together, and we always have each other\\'s back. Now you\\'re going off on your own and doing your own thing ….it\\'s just wrong, Ryan \\' \\'We still are twins, family, Sis, but why can\\'t you get it into that thick head of yours that I am my own person? My ideas and opinions matter,\\' stated Ryan, folding his arms across his chest,\\' I\\'m not just your puppet. I know that you can be overzealous a lot of the time but I really wish you would take a good hard look at yourself in the mirror and realize this scheme to get Troy is all wrong. People are going to get hurt including yourself …..\\' Sharpay clenched her fingers together, tightly, lips pursed together.\\' I listen to you…..sometimes. Troy sees me now. Not his precious Gabriella and it\\'s only a matter of time that we\\'ll finally be together. We\\'ll be the power couple, you just watch and see \\' \\' Only you see it that way \\' Ryan said as he walked away from her , feeling tension in his chest now and wondering if he should join his Mom for yoga to try to relax .\\' It doesn\\'t make it true \\' ***************************Summer Summer ************************************ Still stinging from Ryan\\'s accusations, Sharpay collected herself, smoothing an imaginary wrinkle from her skirt, adjusting the diamond bangle on her wrist, applied another shiny pink coat of gloss to her lips, and marched into the Lava Springs kitchen with authority. Jason saw her first, nearly dropping the colander loudly in the sink, while Martha stopped cutting fruit to toss her head in the direction of the super diva. Chad groaned as he collected the plate and headed to the dining room before he would be forced to serve Sharpay without wanting to kill the girl. It was way too early in the morning to deal with that witch. Zeke was busy plating the Eggs Benedict when he caught the sultry scent of the perfume that could only belong to the girl of his dreams. He straightened, determined to be cool and ignore the pain he felt when he saw her alongside Troy, which was frequently these days. \\'Good morning, Zeke \\' Zeke managed a polite smile \\'Morning, Sharpay,.. May I help you with something? \\' \\' Oh , I was wondering if you\\'d be sweet enough to make me a blueberry muffin of yours for my breakfast ,\\' She lowered her lashes , softened her voice , felt him attentively watching her ,\\' and I normally avoid such high fatty items like Eggs Benedict but it does look quite good \\' \\' I can\\'t just make one muffin , Sharpay, it doesn\\'t work that way ,\\' replied Zeke, forgetting protocol ,\\' I mean if that is your request I will whip up a batch of blueberry muffins for your table . \\'He moved around her to work on adding garnish to another plate,\\' How about you try my Eggs Benedict, Miss. Evans, and risk the calories \\' Sharpay frowned at the coolness in his voice which was far from his normally happy tone, . Normally she enjoyed her peers serving her as if she were Queen of Lava Springs (Well, the princess, if all else) but it sounded too formal coming from Zeke. She enjoyed his adoration and somehow this formality unsettled her much more than she wanted to think about at all. Zeke Baylor wasn\\'t like other guys. He seemed to see her in a much different light than most men. \\'I suppose it couldn\\'t hurt,\\' Sharpay tapped an elegant fingernail lightly against his white chefs jacket,\\' if you\\'ll have it sent to my usual table, Zeke. Thanks so much … toodles \\' \\'Of course, Miss. Evans \\' \\'You don\\'t have to be so formal, Zeke, its fine \\' \\'I don\\'t want to lose my job,\\' Zeke turned his back on her to begin pulling out the ingredients for the muffins;\\' I\\'d better get back to work.\\' Sharpay waited a beat for Zeke to be sweet to her and was slightly befuddled as well as hurt when Zeke resumed working rather than continue talking to her. He never gave her a second glance and there was a dull thud in her heart that the diva promptly ignored as she turned on her very sexy high heels and left the commonness of the kitchen. It didn\\'t matter anymore, there wasn\\'t anything there to be even a blimp in her heart, and she wouldn\\'t allow these feelings to matter. Jason waited a beat before risking in look at his best friend. \\'How ya doing, pal? \\'Asked Jason, wiping his hands on a dishrag,\\' you good? You were like Mr. Cool or something with Sharpay and she didn\\'t even go all Ice Queen on you either, Zeke \\' Zeke continued mixing the batter, his jaw set.\\' It\\'s all crap but I can be in control. I still think there is a different side to Sharpay than her whole façade but I won\\'t be played for her whims or whatever. If Bolton wants to play into her tiger act, I don\\'t give a damn …..\\' Chef David took the whip from Zeke\\'s hand and gestured towards the muffin tin. These teenagers were hard workers and livened up the normally tension filled kitchen milieu. \\'That girl is a viper, Zeke,\\' warned the chef, evenly,\\' you\\'d be smart to steer clear \\' \\'That is much easier said than actually doing,\\' replied Zeke, reaching for a towel to wipe his hands,\\' I\\'m not usually a quitter \\' \\' Think of it as self-perseverance ,\\' stated a wise Chef ,\\' now all of you, back to work as soon we must feed a busload of hungry Roswellians \\' Martha did a quick flash popping and locking to a song playing in her head before resuming cutting fruit , Jason dried an elegant glass bowl to her while Zeke began organizing ingredients to make his fabulous blueberry muffins – it was back to the daily grind of prep work . *************************************Summer Song **************************************************************************** The summer sun beat down on the pool warming Ryan\\'s face as he tilted his head up to bask in its rays momentarily , the pool wasn\\'t exactly packed in the middle of the afternoon as he sat on the edge of the pool dangling his legs in the water whiling away an hour until Kelsi had her lunch break . A shadow fell over him as the dancer removed his sunglasses staring into the grinning face of one Gabriella Montez, lifeguard extradonnaire. \\'Ryan, do you have something against the water? I\\'ve seen you swim in gym \\' Ryan gave her a wry smile.\\' No but if I get into the pool and my Father happens to be strolling by, it becomes more than me just relaxing. It becomes all about my form and improving whatever stroke needs improving and not my vacation \\' Gabriella laughed as she perused the swimmers assuring herself that no one was in grave danger of drowning if she took a few minutes to chat with her friend. It felt as if she hardly left the pool area unless it was break or lunch time or blessedly time to go home for the night but she could hardly complain, the paycheck was nice. \\' Gotcha ,\\' said the dark haired beauty , slanting her eyes at him ever so coyly,\\' so can I assume you\\'re not dying of boredom but rather waiting for a certain tiny musician we both know .\\' \\' Yes , you\\'d be correct ,\\' answered Ryan , jerking his head towards the building ,\\' I\\'ve been thinking about maybe seeing if I could , you know, work here myself this summer rather than be a guest . I\\'m trying not to bug Kelsi during work hours and hanging out with Shar and her wannabes isn\\'t appealing either …\\' Ryan lifted his shoulders then let them drop ,\\' If I worked then I wouldn\\'t feel guilty about fraternizing with Kelsi during work hours\\' Gabriella placed a hand on top of his, her smile encouraging.\\' That is really a very sweet thought, Ryan, and I am sure Mr. Fulton would jump to accommodate your request \\' It might send his sister into an early heart attack too but it was his summer. \\'It\\'s just a thought….\\' \\' Uh, hi,\\' Troy Bolton stuffed his hands in the pockets of his new pressed khaki pants staring down the rich guy with equal parts disdain before sending a questioning look at his own girlfriend ,\\' you have a pool side accident , Evans ? Gabi tending to you now …..\\' Troy knew he was being a jerk but didn\\'t really give a damn , it was Gabriella . Ryan withdrew his hand, frowning.\\' Nope, just talking \\' Gabriella scowled at Troy.\\' Sharpay\\'s private golf lesson finished already? \\' He scratched his head, absently.\\' Oh yeah, she\\'s getting a little better at her swing \\' \\'I bet \\' \\'Ryan,\\' called out Kelsi, wrapping her arms around his neck from behind him, her tone a bit excitable,\\' Guess what? One of the bus guests from Roswell left me a tip for playing his requests and he left me two tickets to the UFO Center in Roswell! How great is that and after we were just talking about it ….now we can go. My treat!\\' Ryan swung her around onto his lap causing her to giggle.\\' Sounds like you need a day off \\' \\'I know and I was thinking it\\'d be fun if we got Martha and Jason to go with us \\' \\'If you think they\\'d be up for a road trip with us ….sure \\' Troy looked from Gabriella then to Kelsi and Ryan, baffled.\\' Am I missing something here?\" \\'Only me and Ryan,\\' Kelsi stood and tugged on her new boyfriends hand,\\' come on, my lunch break goes by super-fast. I am absolutely starving! Bye Troy, bye Gabriella \\' Ryan draped an arm around Kelsi\\'s shoulder while Troy took in this new development within their group then met Gabriella\\'s dark gaze, inquiring not so subtly with his eyes of the flirtation he had walked on in prior. \\' Never figured Ryan Evans to get around this much ….first you are holding hands with the guy then he has Kelsi all lovey dovey with stars in her eyes all of the sudden \\' Gabriella lifted her chin, ignoring the jagged hurt in her heart.\\' I will forget that you just said that, Troy, because that couldn\\'t possibly be you. Not that you deserve anything right now but Ryan and Kelsi are together …excuse me I need to get back to work \\' If this was supposed to be her summer happiness then perhaps Gabriella needed to re-evaluate her priritories. Still Ryan and Kelsi were the surprise couple of the summer which was about perfect and they deserved to be happy .'][Chapter 12] [\"Ryan tried not to feel like an outsider looking in as he joined Kelsi and her group of friends in the kitchen corner reserved for the help. For once everyone's breaks seemed to mesh so they were taking advantage of the fact by hanging out together while the rest of the kitchen staff puttered around them busily. Ryan kept an easy smile on his face as he was here at Kelsi's insistence despite his internal struggle of doubt. Sure he went to school with everyone included, had known them since a very long time, but really Ryan skirted along the edge of the group. He'd spent most of his free time with his sister or in the theatre which was also still with Sharpay which meant, he was still more of a loner. 'Is Troy not joining us? 'Asked Kelsi, quietly as she took in their group. Chad and Taylor sat huddled together sharing a bag of chips, his jaw was clenched tight and he appeared agitated. Martha and Jason sat close together passing a Coke between them while Zeke hovered behind the couples clutching his chef's hat in his hands, listening. Chad scowled.' Bolton is hob-knobbing with Ryan's Dad and Sharpay again on the west patio ' Taylor opened her mouth intent on teasing her boyfriend on his new vocabulary word but upon placing her hand on his arm, felt his tension, causing her to change her mind. Chad and Troy were like brothers and this new Troy seemed to be testing the limits of their friendship. 'I know you don't want to hear this, honey,' brought up Taylor, choosing her words carefully,' but Troy's promotion probably does entail making nice with the members. Granted I didn't get the raise that he did but I spend an inordinately amount of time attending to the guests here and with Mrs. Evans. Maybe we could try to understand …a little.' Zeke scoffed at the suggestion.' Ha! Our so called Captain hasn't willingly spent this much time with Sharpay when we were in school ' Jason fixed him with a knowing look.' Jealous, dude ' 'The whole thing stinks ' 'What stinks?' asked Gabriella, joining the gang a little late. She was still dressed in her red regulation tank suit with a pair of matching board shorts,' I swear I got little Billy Palmer out of the pool before he could christen it. ' Everyone laughed as the tension was broken. Gabriella cheery personality always brightened everyone's moods though Martha lifted a brow towards Taylor signaling that they should turn the whole conversation around. No one wanted to hurt their sweet friend. Ryan saw an opening so took it.' Billy's as much a terror as his older sister is so kudos for keeping your cool with him, Gabriella ' 'Billy's a cute kid but he is really good at being 8 ' 'Is that holy terror Alicia's bratty snot nosed brother? 'This came unexpectedly from Taylor who wiped her hands primly on a wadded up napkin that had been discarded on the table,' I assisted the family luncheon the other day with Fulton. That brat spilled three iced cold lemonades down the front of my new dress which I know was done purposely …' 'I've always thought the kid was evil,' contributed Ryan, caressing the front of Kelsi's hands, gently,' Alicia has some wicked moves too. She isn't just like a clone to Sharpay , believe me , I've witnessed her evilness in action ' 'I would believe that,' muttered Kelsi, softly,' Alicia isn't exactly nice ' 'So are we all going to the Music in the Park concert tonight? 'Asked Martha, scanning the faces of her friends in agreement,' I hear its someone cool making their rounds for outdoor concerts throughout New Mexico and California ' 'I heard that it might be Dido,' sighed an enthusiastic Kelsi of one of her favorite 90's musicians,' I just love all of her music. Here with Me is so beautiful ' 'I think it could be really fun 'this came from Martha, ignoring Jason's glib comment about old angst ridden chick rock,' plus free!' 'Depressing chicks singing about their problems sounds like a blast to me ' Taylor nailed her boyfriend with a withering look that would have made a lesser man cringe in pain. However she and Chad had been dating quite a while now and he wasn't fazed by the look. 'You boys don't have to join us tonight if the music isn't to your taste,' said Taylor, as cool as ice,' feel free to do your own thing. It doesn't have to be date night or anything remotely romantic ….we'll make it a girls night instead ' Chad heaved a desperate sigh.' Babe 'He chose to ignore his girlfriend's haughty tone at the term of affection because he knew Taylor liked it,' Taylor, don't start on this, don't make it a thing. You know I'm dealing with my own issues with my so called best friend ….' Taylor pursed her lips together, took another bite of a chip.' I was starting anything, just stating that originally our plans for the concert were to be with couples. Its fine ' Jason shook his head sharing frowns with the guys.' Fine isn't a good word ' 'I don't trust fine 'volunteered Zeke, solemnly. 'Fine is never fine ' Gabriella chuckled, amused.' You're all being ridiculous. Maybe you'll change your minds when I drag Troy with me to this concert tonight and I am sure that Ryan and Kelsi are going tonight as well ' All eyes turned on the newly formed couple for the answer putting them on the spot. 'Uh, sure,' Ryan waved a hand towards Kelsi,' date night ' 'Date night indeed! 'Mr. Fulton appeared seemingly out of nowhere sweeping the group up in his always irritated state of mind,' Is this some sort of teen meeting brouhaha? I believe that break ended two minutes ago …the pool is unguarded, Miss. Montez. ' Gabriella gulped down another drink of bottled water.' Gotta go ' 'Ms. Nielsen, you are requested by Miss. Evans to accompany her on the piano in the family wing so you'd best hurry,' finished up Fulton, her nerves fraying as always when been pulled on by the demanding Sharpay . He spared Ryan a glance,' Mr. Evans, when did you become kitchen staff? Never mind, it might help if you were to accompany your girlfriend to practice ' Gabriella and the others scattered back to work not waiting for the rest of the lecture leaving Ryan and Kelsi to take the brunt of it. Kelsi heaved a weary side as she nodded her consent. She had known it was only a matter of time before Sharpay would expect her to serve as her own personal pianist as if the world revolved solely around her wishes. 'Off to face the firing squad …..' murmured the composer under her breath,' that's alright, Ryan, you don't have to go. I don't need protecting ….i can handle your evil twin ' 'You don't have to listen to her, Kelsi ,' reassured Ryan, placing a light kiss on her cheek ,' she has no authority over the employees . Only our parents have a say ' Fulton thumbed a Tums.' If only that were true, young Ryan, if only …..' ' I really will be fine ' stated Kelsi, reaching for her bag as she blew him a kiss then raced from the kitchen towards the separate family wing where no doubt Sharpay and her wannabes were already rehearsing for the end of the summer talent show at Lava Springs . 'You should speak to my Mother about Sharpay's orders and everything, Mr. Fulton,' spoke up Ryan, feeling braver than usual,' My sister isn't your boss ' Mr. Fulton stared back at the young man.' Can you say that you've done the same? ' Ryan was contemplative.' I like to think that I have been trying ' ***************************Summer **************************************** The Evans family wing was impressive, the practice room, large and spacious, complete with its own stage and a lovely baby grand piano, and soundproofed should any Lava Springs member get the idea to the best an Evans in a talent contest. Sharpay was dressed to the nines despite the fact it was a rehearsal , Jackie and Alicia were attempting to follow their marks as backup singers , Troy Bolton looked pained , while Kelsi pounded out the upbeat tempo of her normally soft ballad trying not to wince at the changes she had been forced to make to pacify the diva . A trip to the dentist would have been less painful for all involved. Despite everyone's best efforts, the duet looked and sounded straight out of an off very off Broadway production of Rent if it were screeching its story. 'Kelsi, keep up! Why am I ahead of the music? You can be replaced …girls, stop 'bellowed an annoyed Sharpay, tossing her microphone down and signaling for all to stop around her as Jackie and Alicia stumbled into one another ,' Is there a problem? The choreography is basic so it shouldn't be difficult to perfect, girls ' Jackie wiped her perspiration with a clean towel as she sat gracefully on the stage while Alicia simply plopped, reaching for the bottled water in her bag as Troy joined Kelsi by the piano looking for some sympathy. 'It's a little, er, choppy ' ' Kelsi keeps drowning our chorus out with her playing ' Kelsi gnawed on the inside of her cheek trying to compose herself before she did something rash like telling the snotty divas what bridge that they could jump off but she didn't want the confrontation . Tempting it was. Very tempting. 'It isn't supposed to be if it were sung correctly …' 'My way doesn't bore the audience into a deep sleep; Kelsi 'slammed Sharpay, hands on her hip as she assessed the situation. They had only been rehearsing for little over an hour. She had barely broken into a light sweat though the girls looked a bit peaked. Troy seemed to be more on board now than previously so that was a plus and having Kelsi here should have given her a bonus point. The choreography could be better but Sharpay refused to ask Ryan for help. She didn't want to alienate her brother any more than necessary. They were already on the outs and it felt as if something inexplicitly had changed between them. 'Just take ten ' 'Pretty intense,' sighed Troy, looking balefully at his friend,' why do I feel like Sharpay is trying to make this song into a music video or something? ' He enjoyed singing but shoot, this was damn exhausting.' Which I won't be giving her any ideas Kelsi gave him a wan smile.' Thanks ' 'So, you and Ryan Evans? How did I not know about this, Kels? ' Troy considered Kelsi as his honorary sister making it his duty to be overprotective which he nearly dropped the ball on and was seemingly left out of the loop here . Kelsi blushed prettily.' It's new, Troy, shiny new is all I am saying. I like him ' 'He isn't who I would have thought for you,' Troy scratched his neck,' figured for you with Jason who is clearly with Martha. Guess this is why men don't do the whole matchmaking thing like you women enjoy ' 'Jason and I have zero in common,' explained Kelsi, matter of fact,' besides which I would never date someone that my best friend is so crazy about. It isn't right at all ' 'Just be careful, Kels. Ryan is still an Evans ' Kelsi bit back a retort then lifted her own gaze towards a pacing Sharpay .' I could say the same thing to you, Troy ' Troy openly gaped at his shy friend. 'Whoa! What's this about? I am not with Sharpay – I'm just helping her out. Her parents have been really incredible helping me and being nice to Sharpay isn't anything like dating …..' He couldn't believe that he didn't have to explain himself to Kelsi – she was being really sensitive. Troy was trying to consider his future and never would he have imagined that a summer job would have perks that would help lead to his road of success. 'If you say so ….' Kelsi wasn't about to debate the issue with Troy and left it be. She didn't want to believe he would betray the love of his life but she couldn't help wondering if he realized how all the private lunches and golf sessions with the diva looked to others. 'That's enough;' Sharpay clapped her hands together,' rest time is over now. Kelsi, from the beginning please. Try to keep it upbeat , I'm not singing it sappy style ' 'I need this job 'muttered Kelsi , under her breath , ignoring the jab the insult brought as Troy rejoined the diva in hot pink center stage, retrieving the microphone from the chair . 'Can we do it without the wind machine? Makes it hard to sing if gusts of wind blowing around in my face …' 'That takes some of the pizzazz out of the number,' pouted Sharpay leaning in towards Troy as if to give him a side hug,' but I suppose it couldn't hurt ' 'Thanks ' Kelsi was afraid that it was going to be a very long day in practice hell – she would have preferred shining silverware to having to skewer her new love song . ***********************Summer Summer ******************************* Ryan suffered through a one on one game of golf with his Father with a resigned Chad caddying for them while Sharpay was closed off with Troy in the family wing rehearsing for the talent show which was a point of contention between them. Usually Vance enjoyed the downtime the summer brought because it allowed him more time to spend with his family but his daughter's devotion towards the talented Troy Bolton had inspired him to take a big part in helping to mold the young man's college dream through his own connections. He liked Troy, the young man wasn't wishy washy and his flighty daughter needed the stability that a relationship with the Bolton boy could bring to make her mature a bit more. His wife worried that Sharpay's meddling could be damaging to Troy's relationship with the Montez girl but Vance figured it was a challenge to test the relationship. Only time would tell in the romance department. 'Son, you missed that by a mile,' warned Vance, as the ball rolled right past the hole,' I thought you'd been brushing up on your game. You're getting older now; I was hoping to have you join me on the green when I conduct business throughout it, Ryan ' I didn't feel like taking golf lessons would be any fun ,' said Ryan, truthfully ,' maybe mini golf but the club doesn't have that here .' He smiled, weakly,' It's a thought, eh? New idea? ' Vance gave him an exasperated look . 'Hardly fitting anesthetic for Lava Springs. I wish you were as confident with the idea of working the family business as you are with the theatre, Ryan. It is an option available to you and your sister ' 'I know, Dad, but I was thinking Julliard first before I consider not making it out there ' 'Of course you know your mother and I support you and your sister's dreams but it doesn't hurt to keep business as a backup plan. Play it smart, son ' 'So you keep reminding me …' Chad handed Vance a different club then scooted closer to Ryan.' Man, Evans, your Dad is really giving you the hard sell about the family business. My folks are just glad I've kept my grades good enough to be considered into the U of A and even California University ' Ryan lifted his shoulders in a careless shrug noting that Vance's cell phone shrilled taking him away from his game back into that shark business mode he lived and breathed in. It would however give him a minute to himself then answered Chad's question. 'My sister has zero financial sense at all,' stated Ryan, not unkindly. It was a cold, hard fact that was his twin sister,' or much of a people person either …most of the staff here hate her. Fulton is terrified of her so I think Dad hopes to sway me on the idea ' Chad chuckled,' Yeah, you don't look like the idea took, man ' ' I'm trying not to put the blame on Troy, ' went on Ryan, leaning on the club he held ,' I mean Dad helping him with all the contacts and stuff , I figure the whole thing got Dad thinking that I should follow in his footsteps if my dancing career doesn't take off ' Chad considered this along with his own annoyance at his best friend.' You should blame Bolton all you want, Ryan. For all we know he might have brought it up …we don't know.' 'That's a stretch, Chad, way out there ' ' Yeah, well, I wouldn't put it pass him either ,' said a bitter Chad ,' I'm starting to not recognize the dude who's like my brother . Bolton's playing a dangerous game messing with Sharpay and Gabriella and I don't want to be around when that blows up in his face ' *********************************Summer Song ****** Despite the unusually long day at the country club along with the girls thinly veiled suggestions that went along with the free concert in the park, Chad, Zeke, and Jason begged off citing that they needed to just hang out , pig out on pizza and junk food, and watch action movies as a way to let off steam. Rather than complain at them, the girls deemed it girls night with the exception of the only couple joining them being Ryan and Kelsi and joined the masses clambering around the small stage in the park. Gabriella had cornered Troy during his break hoping to cajole him into joining her tonight but he was very apologetic having already made plans to have dinner with some of the college ball players from the U of A. Scholarships had been mentioned and Troy felt like it would be uncool and rude to cancel on them when they were helping him out. His girlfriend tried ignoring the hurt even as he apologized promising they would make plans soon but now as the local radio station blasted some alt hits from the 1990's , Gabriella tried to enjoy the music . Taylor tugged on Gabi's arm, giving her a shake.' Snap out of it! It's Troy's loss for choosing more of the snotty club than spending time with you tonight unless you want to give him hell in which case I will add my own two cents in ….' 'I'm trying to understand where he is coming from, Tay, but this is the third date he has cancelled on me this week ' 'You should let Troy know how you feel before I do,' stated Taylor, sharply,' I don't like him messing with my best friend and my boyfriend's feelings as if they don't matter. Chad's about a half a second of blowing up which is why I didn't make a big deal out of him not joining me here ' Gabriella tried to be fair as she fiddled with the necklace Troy had given her in a nervous gesture. She hoped this wasn't a repeat performance of last year. 'I am sure Troy isn't neglecting us on purpose ' Taylor narrowed her eyes then scoffed,' I don't know if I believe that anymore, Gab ' Before Gabriella could defend Troy's choices of late, Martha barged between them shooting them each fixed looks as if to say now wasn't the time for deep debates; this was a freaking concert, for Heaven's sake! 'Uh oh no work talks, no male bashing,' chided Martha, wagging a finger at both of them,' we're free tonight! It's Nelly Furtado! We're supposed to be having fun...like them ' She gestured towards Ryan and Kelsi – he had his arms wrapped around her then much to her surprise swung her out, Kelsi laughed out loud , Ryan spun her back into him, making up the steps to a dance only they could imagine together . Martha sighed; Taylor added her own sigh to the mix, as did ever romantic Gabriella, all wistful. 'Hello New Mexico ' Nelly Furtado bounced on the stage looking rock chic in worn jeans and a black tank top, long dark hair braided , as the familiar chords of her hit song reverberated from the band , she began to sing . You're beautiful, that's for sure You'll never ever fade You're lovely but it's not for sure That I won't ever change Ryan pulled Kelsi against him, she gazed up at him, a soft smiling touching her pink lips as she sang along, and he felt completely happy. I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is (And baby all I need for you to know is) I'm like a bird, I'll only fly away I don't know where my soul is, I don't know where my home is No one noticed the tall, gangly young man watching Ryan and Kelsi so intently; he ignored the slight pain behind his eyes, somehow recognizing that the couple could help him with his quest. He just needed to figure out the best way to approach them to ask for help but right now wasn't the time. He glanced at his watch then headed for his car to go home. He could make it back to Roswell if he left now .\"][Chapter 13] [\"Kelsi felt as if she was floating on a sea that was sweeping, swirling, spinning around possibly drifting into love. Every moment spent with Ryan brought new surprises; they had so much in common, and were learning more about one another all of the time. He made her laugh and got her to try new things. She challenged him to be his own man and Ryan owned it. Her friends were accepting him into their little group more and more each day even Chad who had been reluctant and suspicious of Ryan's motives according to Taylor. If Ryan joined her on the piano during the lunch rush at the club, Mr. Fulton only nodded, without a word to them. They were partners and a couple. She thought they were becoming closer every day spent together; found she was looking forward to spending more time with him. Kelsi had hoped that Ryan would get on with joining them working at the club but knew he had been wavering about it for weeks now. For a guy who was totally confident, Kelsi thought it odd that Ryan was afraid of that much change when it came down to talking to his parents about a job. Or maybe it had to do with the expectations of the rich though as far as Kelsi could tell, his mother worked efficiently at Lava Springs yet still managed to fit in an afternoon at the in home spa or entertaining the ladies luncheon. Sigh either way Kelsi didn't want to become the nagging girlfriend so she kept silent. This afternoon was the employees practice baseball game which Kelsi was hoping to convince Ryan to come along with her to watch the game then maybe go out afterwards. She was clocking out when Martha came up behind her, swatting her arm, lightly. 'Did you ask Fulton for hazard pay for having to play for Sharpay and her evil wannabes? ' Kelsi made a face as the practices hadn't gone any smoother than to be expected with Sharpay being demanding, Troy attempting to keep up with her, and the usual drama that the diva always seemed to bring with her. She tried not to think how it ruined the playful, sweetness of the song that she had written as it only made her upset. She had tried standing her ground insisting the song wasn't available but Sharpay wouldn't have it so she had given in. She could have asked Ryan to talk to his sister but Kelsi didn't want to be that needy. 'I wish,' admitted Kelsi as they walked outside into the clear blue skies together towards Martha's car,' Even with Troy sort of singing the duet with her, Sharpay has managed to butcher the love song. Never mind me, where is Jason? ' ' The guys got off work an hour ago so they went out to the field to start batting practice ,' explained Martha of her own boyfriends absence ,' Chad was trying to see if they could hit up Troy to join them but I'm not expecting that to happen .' 'He has been awfully absorbed in his own stuff lately 'says Kelsi , smoothing her lips together in a thin line ,' Troy seemed okay to me during rehearsal the other day ' She hated to think the worse of her good friend even though it appeared to her as if Troy wasn't exactly dissuading Sharpay's flirtation. To play devil's advocate, Kelsi really couldn't tell if he encouraged the diva either and she had been witness during the last two practices. It only made her feel awkward if truth be told. Martha rolled her eyes heavenward as they climbed in her car then took off towards the field a couple miles up the road from Lava Springs. Though the ballpark connected to the country club, it was just distance enough to make it seem separate. 'Well I think Troy is acting like a big jerk,' declared the opinionated Martha with a flip of her dark hair, her yellow plastic earrings moving as she talked as she pulled into a parking spot near the golf cart,' Jason tries to be neutral about the whole thing but I know he feels as if Troy has been ignoring him. Not that he would ever admit it, he is still a guy ' 'That is too bad 'surmised Kelsi , adjusting her red cap on her head . She and Martha had changed out of their work outfits into shorts and bright colored tee shirts for the game though neither of them was playing,' you know I was hoping to get Ryan to join us to watch the game but I haven't seen him all morning ' Martha fixed the bandana from sliding down her hair as they climbed out of the car then began walking towards the bleachers in the stands to join their friends as Taylor and Gabriella were supposed to be saving them seats. She scanned the crowd for their friends lifting her arm to her forehead to shade the sun from her face when she noticed the spiky blonde hair that could only be Ryan Evans looking to be having a very lively conversation with Gabriella. 'Um, Kels, he's already here ' Kelsi followed Martha's gaze to the bottom row of the bleachers just as Ryan leaned in closer while Gabriella laid a hand on his arm. The composer pursed her lips as an unknown emotion swept through her body at the innocent gesture. 'What are you talking about, Martha? O…oh, I see …..' Did Gabriella have to be so touchy with her boyfriend? As if sensing the direction of her thoughts, Martha patted her hand.' I am sure it is perfectly harmless, Kels. Gabs wouldn't poach your guy. We all know she's gaga over Troy and the girl wouldn't think of cheating ….' Everything Martha was saying was valid. There was no reason not to trust Ryan or Gabriella but the sight still made Kelsi's nerves bunch up with apprehension kicking her own insecurity into overdrive as it were. She was being ridiculous. Gabriella had been super supportive of her and Ryan from the get goes, not to mention that she and Ryan were friends as well. Goodness Gabi had even tutored Ryan in math last year. She must have been soaking up too many bad vibes from the country club for her brain to be kicking it crazily into the absurd . 'I know, Martha, it's just a surprise is all to, um, see them here together ' 'With Taylor….. ' Taylor spotted them waving them over then jabbing Gabriella in the ribs in indication. 'Gangs all here ' Kelsi pasted her friendliest smile on her face.' Let's join them ' The stands were crowded with familiar faces from the kitchen staff to the cleaning staff filling the stands as all were taking advantage of hanging out to watch the baseball game as well as enjoy the perfect New Mexico summer afternoon . During the actual game they would be playing against the kids from the halfway house in town but for today, it was all fun. Not to mention a productive way to let off steam from the stress of catering to the fancy folks at the country club on a daily basis and all of their demands . Chad was already at the bat giving some practice swings while Zeke and Jason were out in the field tossing the ball around absorbing themselves into the game. Their team leader was noticeably absent, Troy's energy missing from the sports itself. Hurt that Troy hadn't responded to her three texts and phone call, Gabriella did her best to put the problem behind her to enjoy the day instead with her good friends. Ryan had seemed a bit out of sorts when she had run into him earlier so Gabi had invited him along to the game. Ryan had brightened considerably at the invitation planning to surprise Kelsi too. Breaking away and changing had a cost that Ryan feared he was being painfully paying the price for excluding him from all of what he had always known. Funny how it wasn't fame but family that ate at him today. He liked doing his own thing but couldn't deny he still felt the sting of being rejected by his own twin and still felt as if he wasn't quite good enough to strike out performing on his own. Not wanting to bring Kelsi down by his damn mood, Ryan had avoided his girlfriend choosing to go for a walk to think when Gabriella had discovered him insisting that he join her and Taylor this afternoon. He wasn't allowed to mope any longer. Gabriella wouldn't take no for an answer so now Ryan found himself sitting on the bleachers between her and Taylor listening to the girls debating over French fries and a diet coke for a snack . He thought ballpark food all sounded good that he might even go all out and have a hot dog, nachos and cheese, and a regular coke. 'I had a salad yesterday,' announced Taylor as if it was some sort of executive decision rather than just lunch,' I deserve salty French fries ' 'Go for it ' Taylor took off for the concession stand while Gabriella smiled sweetly up at Ryan placing a hand lightly on his arm. He looked in dire need of some cheering up. 'Ryan, I was thinking about the talent show,' brought up a tentative Gabriella,' since you aren't in the show with your sister maybe you could help all of us, the staff, I mean, by directing us. Kelsi is composing the music but we have no idea how to put it together into anything ...' She wants me to go up against my sister 'realized Ryan to himself,' wouldn't that be the ultimate betrayal? ' Was it another test of his will? Still the idea of choreographing and directing a whole group of people stirred something creatively in him so then how could he turn that down? He would never know what he was capable of if he didn't learn to let go and fly. Ryan chuckled inwardly to himself noting with irony of a performer that he was taking life lessons from Wicked and Fame. What the hell! It had to be some sort of karma or fate gig. Who was he kidding? He absolutely had to take the gig! 'Uh, sure, I think I can do that if you think kids will listen to me ….' Ryan scratched his brow,' Besides it'll be a project that Kelsi and I can work on together ' 'What can we work on together, Ry? 'Inquired Kelsi, as she and Martha scooted in beside them on the bleachers,' what are you doing here? I looked for you this morning but I never saw you …now here you are ' If hurt crept into her voice, she couldn't help it but managed a tight smile that didn't quite reach her lips. If Ryan noticed it, he never let on as he reached for her hand to tug her down on the bleacher seat beside him, keeping her hand firmly in his own. 'Sorry,' apologized Ryan, sheepishly,' I overslept then there was some family things going on so I didn't get up to the main room in the club. I was, uh, actually heading your way when Gabriella kidnapped me ...' Kelsi's smile didn't quite reach her eyes.' That was nice of you, Gabriella ' 'Ryan looked like a gloomy Gus, Kelsi, so I insisted he needed to come watch practice with us 'answered Gabriella, ever so sweetly. As usual, she looked beautiful in a pretty floral camisole and capris. 'He has also just agreed to be our director for the staff portion of the talent show ' 'Wow, that is great ' Ryan bumped his shoulders against Kelsi's managing a rueful grin.' The experience will be good plus Gabriella can be really persuasive ' Besides Kelsi, Martha let out a very un-ladylike snort.' I bet ' In spite of her only moments earlier defense of Gabriella Montez, the young woman couldn't help but notice the tell a tell weird signs of the dark haired beauty sitting quite close to Ryan and the extra attention she seemed to be paying to him . It was a bell ringing alarm clanging type of signs that was hard to ignore though she hoped to God, Kelsi didn't notice . Fact was that Gabriella loved Troy, Troy loved Gabriella, but unless you were blind, something was wrong with their relationship this summer even if neither one of them acknowledged said facts. Onto fact number two that Gabi didn't like or approve or play games, maybe she was unconsciously projecting her feelings onto a clueless Ryan Evans or so Martha hoped was the case. That more likely had some strange sense to it but Martha still didn't like it, it was shady. 'I'm glad you're here, Ryan 'muttered Kelsi, under her breath. She rested her head against his shoulder as he bent to drop a kiss on her hat,' I missed you ' He removed her hat then kissed her hair.' I missed you too ' She lifted her face to stare at him, eyes wide and thoughtful beneath her frames, not forgetting what Gabriella had said about him being in a gloomy mood. 'If your upset about something, we could go for a walk and talk ' 'I don't feel like talking,' Ryan cut her off, his tone sharper than he intended missing her wince at it then looks away,' let's just watch the game. Okay? Hey, I'm going to go grab some lunch for us ...' 'Could you get me a water ' 'Sure 'Ryan stood up, letting go of Kelsi, leaving her feeling utterly bereft,' keep my seat warm ' 'I'll go with you, Ryan 'Gabriella chimed in, moving to his side,' Tay is going to be stingy and wont share her fries with me ' Taylor grinned.' Get your own calories, girlie 'She popped a French fry into her mouth as Gab and Ryan walked towards the concession booth then she noticed the stricken expressions on Kelsi and Martha's faces ,' oh no, stop that thought right this moment , both of you ' 'I have no idea what you are talking about 'denied Kelsi, playing with the bill of her cap. Martha met Taylor's gaze.' I hate to think it , Taylor, but Gabriella did everything but toss her hair and the lean in , which incidentally we could have missed …maybe the girl doesn't get what she is doing ' 'Martha, don't,' this came from Kelsi, ignoring her own unease,' I am sure it isn't like that. Gabriella and Ryan are friends, she is just being friendly …..' Taylor wagged a handful of fries in their direction.' Compelling argument, Martha, but Troy isn't even here for Gabriella to make him jealous if that is what you are suggesting. I happen to know my bestie , I think Gabi is just adopting Ryan today as her pet project ' ' Ryan isn't a pet ,' remarked Kelsi, sounding perturbed at the idea ,' He just has a bunch of family stuff going on right now that he is trying to figure out . Not to mention our relationship is still really new and we're still figuring us out …' Taylor fixed her with a stern look.' All the more reason for you not to be jealous, Kelsi ' Kelsi let her eyes stray towards the concession stand where a giggling Gabriella allowed Ryan to pull her into an impromptu swing dance and the composer's heart plummeted at the sight. Innocent or not, she couldn't help from biting down hard on her lip, worrying. 'Or be a lot jealous '\"][Chapter 14] [\"It was the baseball game from hell. What was supposed to be a fun break away from work with only a bit of friendly competition between friends and co-workers had turned into an aggressive game as Chad and the guys taking their frustration on the Troy Bolton situation rolling it into the game . Even Jason Cross who was always the optimistic seemed to be playing on the hazy side while Zeke still reeling from what he now termed the Sharpay incident appeared almost glib . It wasn't a pretty sight all the way around and from their vantage point in the bleachers; the girls were at a loss at how to fix the matter themselves. Taylor clenched her hands tightly on her lamp wincing as Chad angrily tossed the bat aside before loping around the bases nearly elbowing the person guarding it in the process. 'I can't believe Chad's behavior,' muttered a concerned Taylor, under her breath,' it's unsportman-like and just plain rude all the way around. I know that he is still pissed but this behavior is so unacceptable …..' 'Men are barbaric and stupid, Tay,' remarked Gabriella in a tone no one recognized from the genuinely sweet young woman,' just because you are Chad's girlfriend doesn't mean you can think for him. Maybe Chad needs to just be angry for a while to get over the whole thing ' Taylor pursed her lips, turned her head to focus on her bestie , and bit back the retort that was on the edge of her tongue . Gabriella was also not acting much like her normal self at the moment in flirt mode with Ryan Evans but Tay didn't want to cause a scene either. She had already did her best to dissuade Kelsi and Martha of any wayward thoughts they might be considering all the way intending to pull Gabriella aside after the game for a full on interrogation to be on the safe side . She had it all under control. 'That may be true but I don't want to lecture myself right out of a relationship,' picked up a thoughtful Taylor,' Chad and I are good together. I am learning the art of compromise and picking then choosing my battles with the boy …' Ryan took a drink of his pop, nodded.' That makes sense, I would think ' Martha turned away from the fence, heaving a wary sigh as she dropped her arms to her side. ' I just hope the stress doesn't get Jason hurt out there ,' said Martha , biting the side of her lip ,' he gets easily distracted when he is worried so he doesn't pay as much attention as he should be . They've sucked the fun right out of this game...we should have just forgotten the whole thing and gone out to Taylor's for a cook out instead ...' If the guys didn't start focusing more on the game rather than focusing on the absence of Troy, not to mention their obvious anger at him, the main kitchen staff was going to start getting even more pissed at them. Jason was likely to get whacked by a ball yet. Kelsi sent a sidelong glance at her own boyfriend before standing to join Martha by the fence. Whatever was going on with Ryan causing him to be sort of standoffish towards her, which was his problem? If he didn't want to talk to her, that was just fine. She would be fine; she would handle this in a mature matter. ' Maybe we should suggest calling it quits on practice today ,' brought up the composer , quietly ,' before someone does get hurt out there for real . Maybe getting away from all of this country club vibe getting back into town to hang out would be for the better.' Ryan dropped his gaze to hers.' Country club vibe? What exactly does that mean, Kelsi ? ' 'It just means that getting back to normal for a little while could help us all ' 'Right because this isn't the average norm for the rest of you…..i get it 'snapped Ryan, finding himself unreasonably annoyed by the statement and with her, seemingly. Kelsi's eyes flashed momentarily at him.' All of this tension isn't fun for any of us ' She was suddenly very confused – were they talking about their friends or the state of their relationship? Kelsi wasn't at all sure of what to make out of Ryan's behavior which seemed to be changing in a flash before her eyes. So much for her plans for them spending a fun, carefree sort of afternoon together but she didn't need him, she was a big girl, and this day could still be salvaged. 'You know it all starting to feel a little too much Dawson's Creek for me ,' announced Ryan , feeling more like an outsider again,' I think I'll just go back to my room ' Gabriella slapped an iron hand on his wrist then gave him a stern look.' Only because you're pouting like Dawson Leery, Ryan, so, you need to stop. You are not going anywhere and Kelsi is exactly right. We are going to call a time out or a hiatus on this game and go to Taylor's house for the second annual McKessie cook out of the summer ' No one uttered a word to stop her nor did Chad or the others put up a fight, they simply agreed to call the game quits, gather their equipment together, then everyone headed towards the vehicles forming a caravan back into Alberquere. ***********************Summer Summer Summer ******************************* Though Taylor's folks were taken by surprise when their daughter showed up with her group of friends on her heels, Taylor quickly explained that the lines between work and play had taken a toll on the baseball game prompting them to decide on an impromptu cook out here. Not wanting to know more about the current angst of teenagers, they reminded Taylor of the ground rules of the house and left them to it as they had plans of their own. Outside, Jason and Martha worked together at putting up the volleyball net while Chad concentrated on the charcoal grill as Kelsi would be along shortly to play their own personal d.j. , having gone home to get her portable keyboard and sound board . Ryan had got drafted to set out lawn chairs from the small shed. 'Do we need this many chairs? I thought there was just going to like 10 of us …..' Chad studied the charcoal bricks intently before placing the bag on the ground then fixed the dancer with attitude with a disgusted look. 'Twist a muscle there, Evans? Too much work for you lugging a two pound ancient lawn chair from like 1987 then feel free to stop ' Chad tossed back , gauging the foil ,' did you and Kelsi have a fight or something ? You've been in a crappy mood all the way over here …' Ryan flopped down unceremonially in a chair, taking off his hat.' I didn't twist anything, and Kelsi and I didn't have a fight. Like you have room to lecture me, I wasn't out on the field trying to take anyone out because your pissed off at Bolton ' Chad tossed the roll of foil on the picnic table as he let out a low growl.' I know I've been acting like an ass ,' admitted a defeated Chad , under his breath ,' You don't have to call me out on it, Evans , kind of shocked you got the balls to do so . I'm trying to let it go before I make my girlfriend reconsider dating me …..Which she would ' Ryan gave a half shrug.' It's a lot of work trying to be friends with you guys. You don't exactly make it easy, not to mention, I am in a war with my sister, so you don't hold the record on being pissed either ' Chad chuckled, lightly.' Guess your human after all, Evans.' Sometimes Ryan seemed too put together and perfect, it grated on his nerves. His life wasn't perfect and Chad worked hard at it because dating Taylor who embodied it wasn't always a piece of cake. He had a rep to protect as the second in command of the Wildcats, keep his grades decent, and Taylor had all of these expectations of their relationship, it could be rough sometimes juggling everything when his best friend had it all. Except now he didn't know who the hell Troy was these days, let alone what the hell was going on in his brain, it hurt and it really made him rage over it. It was like the dude didn't give a damn anymore. ' Never claimed otherwise ,' admitted Ryan, dryly,' I've been in a crappy mood since this morning which is why I shouldn't have even came to this shin dig but Gabriella didn't give me much of a choice . I must have done something wrong because Kelsi has been avoiding me since we left the ballpark ….' Having overheard the boys conversation, Martha picked up the volleyball lobbed it over the net bopping the surprised dancer in the head. Jason sent her a weird look as he called out an apology. 'Hey!' 'Sorry, Ryan, 'called out Jason,' Martha wasn't paying any attention, she didn't mean to hit you ' Martha folded her arms across her chest and feigned a sweet smile.' Yes, I did,' declared Martha, not one to mince words,' you need to stop being an idiot, Ryan, and pay attention to your actual girlfriend, if you know what I mean ' Ryan stood to face Martha, baffled by her comment.' What exactly does that mean?' Jason considered this a no brainer but obviously Ryan was preoccupied by something.' Dude, you need to spend more time with Kelsi, duh. Riding into town with Gabriella probably wasn't the right thing to do in a girls mind ….not that it means anything bad because that would be silly.' Martha tugged on her boyfriend's hand.' If Ryan can't figure it out on his own, we're certainly not going to give him any hints.' Jason gave her a puppy dog look that she couldn't resist.' I am right, Martha. I know I got this one. Even I am not blind …' Martha distracted him with a light kiss on the lips.' Close enough honey, but we are not helping him anymore. I have to stand by Kelsi on this one.' They headed to the garage for the large cooler then took off to pick up some water and soft drinks to contribute to the cook out leaving Ryan scratching his brow and pondering the issue at hand. The dancer looked hopefully towards the jock. Chad finished lighting the charcoal then looked up at Ryan.' Beats me but Jason must be close or Martha wouldn't have dragged him off. My guess you need to be more lovey dovey with Kelsi, man ' 'I can't do that if Kelsi is avoiding me …' 'I have my own problems, Evans,' said Chad, not unkindly,' just fix it ' Meanwhile in the kitchen, Taylor had pulled out bags of potato chips from the pantry, along with hamburger and hot dogs from the refrigerator while Gabriella had raided the house for ingredients to put together a cold pasta salad. Kelsi had called earlier saying she would be along in thirty minutes with the music equipment and a pan of chocolate brownies that she was making. Gabriella busied herself cutting tomatoes on the cutting board as she waited for the water to boil for the pasta and resisted the urge to check her phone. She had sent another text to Troy inviting him to the party but hadn't had a response yet then again he hadn't answered the first text from nearly two hours ago either. It hurt to be ignored and dismissed. Gabriella tried to be positive, not wanting to give into her fears about their relationship, but it was growing oh so more difficult with every day they didn't make time to spend time together especially since Troy seemed to be able to find time for Sharpay Evans . Taylor caught her stray gaze and fixed her with a knowing look.' Still no Troy ' Gabriella busied herself by placing the tomatoes into a large bowl.' Taylor, don't start, please, I'm sure it's something work related. Troy is very focused right now is all ' Taylor scoffed at the idea as her friend dumped pasta into the boiling water with more care than was necessary. She glanced down at her detailed list and thought about her words, carefully, before opening up a big, ole can of worms. 'Okay I won't bring up the she-devil,' hedged Taylor, watching her friend's spine go rigid at the veiled reference to the blonde diva,' I know you have eyes, girl. However, you might not be aware that you might be projecting whatever it is your feeling onto Ryan Evans ' Gabriella twisted the gold necklace Troy had given her, nervously.' Taylor, what on Earth is you talking about? Please stop psychoanalyzing me and being ridiculous ….Ryan and I are good friends. You know I got to know him better since I tutored him last semester helping him so he could pass math …' Taylor picked up a cucumber that needed sliced before wagging in her best friend's direction. ' Gab, I love you but your body language is putting the moves on Ryan ,' pointed Out Taylor , matter of fact ,' I know it's probably self-conscience sort of thing where maybe you don't get what your doing so this is why I am telling you to stop . We all know that Ryan had a little crush on you last year; I know he's crazy about Kelsi, but you wouldn't want to accidentally give off the wrong impression. It could get messy really fast, Gabriella ' Gabriella took the vegetable from her friends hand then collected her thoughts.' I think you've been watching too much One Tree Hill with Chad , Tay, but if it will make you feel better , I'll stop whatever it is you claim I am doing ' Taylor took some large plastic bowls from the cabinet, nodding.' No more hair tossing ' Gabriella pretended to be offended.' I do not toss my hair! I never toss my hair ' 'Don't start! Don't give Ryan any signs either ' 'Go nag your boyfriend, leave me be 'Gabriella shooed Taylor away before picking up her phone one last time for the afternoon. No missed calls, no new messages either. Obviously their relationship wasn't as much a priority to Troy as it was for her. ******************************Summer ***************************** 'No more brooding please, Chad 'muttered Taylor, placing the platter of burgers and hot dogs on the small table besides the grill before draping her arms around his neck, leaning forward to look at him,' I know your still upset at Troy which you have every right to be but could we try to put it aside for the rest of the day.' Chad managed a wan smile before drawing her into a slow, steamy kiss.' How's that for distractions? You can keep me distracted like this for the rest of the afternoon, Taylor ' Taylor sighed, dreamily.' We'll see …..We may have to help distract others ' 'Shit! Why? Can't we mind our own business? ' Taylor put on her resolve face.' I refuse to be held for possible break ups ' 'Which you wouldn't be if we didn't interfere ' She handed her boyfriend the spatula, her expression determined.' Man the grill ' Chad swore under his breath then manned the food. Kelsi and Zeke were neighbors of sorts living only a few houses down from one another a fact that she was quite grateful for this afternoon especially since it meant they could carpool to the party at Taylor's house. Zeke had whipped up a batch of homemade chocolate chip cookies for the party and was only too glad to help her lug everything from the car to the yard. Zeke collected the Tupperware with the sweets in them.' I'll put these up then come back to help you with your equipment, Kelsi . Don't try getting them by yourself ' Kelsi tucked her keyboard underneath her arm. 'I can manage fine, Zeke ' Ryan removed his hands from his pockets looking sheepishly at her.' I'll help ' 'Suit yourself …' managed Kelsi, coolly,' the rest is in the trunk ' It would have been much easier to bring her Dad's ancient portable boom box but having her equipment would keep her busy from socializing. Maybe it would give her some clue as to what exactly was going on with Ryan who hadn't exactly rushed over to kiss her or anything. Maybe Ryan had changed his mind about her or maybe it really was a summer thing. 'I missed you, Kelsi …' 'Yeah, me too 'echoed the composer, softly as she walked away from him. Ryan pulled out the sound board pausing to stare at Kelsi as she busied herself wondering exactly what is that he had done wrong with her. Was she giving him the cold shoulder or just being quiet? Kelsi could be just quiet when she wanted to be there didn't have to be a problem. Zeke took the speakers from the back.' I don't know what you did to the girl but Kelsi didn't say more than two words over here. You should probably start groveling, Evans ...' Ryan gaped at him.' I didn't do anything; we haven't had a fight that I know of …..I must have missed something back at the ballgame ' 'Better apologize,' suggested Zeke, helpfully,' Kelsi probably wouldn't do anything but her best friend is Martha. If that girl gets it into her head you hurt Kelsi, I wouldn't put it past her to get revenge ' Ryan swallowed the lump lodged in his throat.' Revenge? This isn't a teen soap, its real life' Zeke just sent him a knowing look.' Your sister is the Queen Bee of Mean and your questioning whether Martha Cox would murder you for hurting Kelsi ? Think about that one ' 'Good point 'conceded Ryan, hauling the soundboard from the car then assisting a very quiet Kelsi in setting it up. She pushed her black frames up on her nose then went to work, adjusting knobs then the sound and not so much giving him the time of day . Ryan was contemplating the best approach with Kelsi when Gabriella handed him a plate of food then began questioning him about the difficulties in learning to swing dance. He didn't think she had that much intrest in the forties style dance but he could explain it to her. 'It's not that difficult to learn,' replied Ryan, trying to catch Kelsi's eye but she ignored him,' it's a few simple steps which I could show you how to do them, Gabriella ' 'Oh would you, Ryan? 'Gabriella touched his leg, innocently enough unaware that Kelsi was seeing red,' I just think it would be fun to learn. It's something different, you know …..' 'It's cool ….' Taylor slapped iced cold bottled water against Gabriella's shoulder.' No, no, no ' 'It's just choreography,' said Ryan, simply,' I've been giving it a lot of thought lately. I could give you a lesson after we eat, Gabriella …it's no problem ' 'Thank you, Ryan 'Gabriella flashed him a million watt smile that no male was immune too. Focusing on learning something new would take her mind off of Troy. Kelsi set her jaw then let loose with the next track reverberating loudly through the yard mirroring her own feelings at this very moment. So tell me who makes the rules ….. Should have been born on the Milky Way. I wanna belong to the world today Oh, life's a bitch and then you die Can't believe what I heard today If I fall …oh if I fall Martha winced, sent a worried glance towards Kelsi before handing Jason her empty plate with orders.' Go drag Ryan into a game of volleyball, get Zeke to help you if you have too ' Baffled at the weirdness happening around them, Jason noted that Ryan was twirling Gabriella around the yard oblivious that this hard music really didn't suit it or that Kelsi looked kind of sick. Nothing good was going to come from whatever was going on here. 'The dude is dancing …' 'You could beat Ryan up for me but I should talk to Kelsi first,' admitted Martha, signaling for Taylor to do something about Gabriella,' I don't know who to blame here ' Jason took in the dancing non-couple , a hovering Taylor, and a stricken looking Kelsi figured it was some huge misunderstanding but beating up Evans wasn't on his list on fun things to do at a cook out with his friends either . However, Martha looked furious. So tell me who makes the rules …. Oh, life's a bitch and then you die Kelsi glanced down at the paper plate, the hamburger growing cold, as the composer sank into the chair that had been brought over for her, her appetite gone completely. Ryan seemed to be totally charmed by Gabriella as Taylor tried to suggest an alternative to a couples dance for them all , Kelsi couldn't help agreeing with the sentiment of the old 1990's song . Oh she knew that she was probably being unfair, that she should get up and talk to her boyfriend but old insecurities had reared their ugly head making it seem so impossible. Even if it was all harmless fun, Kelsi knew she could never compete with Gabriella nor was she up to a confrontation with Ryan either. It was much too hard. 'Save the dance lessons for work, Evans,' Chad snagged the volleyball from a relieved Jason,' how about some volleyball? Guys versus the girls ' ' I'm down with it ' announced Zeke, finishing up his third hamburger and the last handful of greasy potato chips wiping his hands on a napkin ,' burn off some energy so we can make room to eat dessert ' Gabriella stepped back from Ryan, hands moving to her hips, suspicion directed at her friends who seemed intent on making something out of nothing. Honestly, she had thought that they had long learned that lesson by now but she didn't want to go down that road again. 'What has gotten into you guys? Can't we wait until everyone has finished eating ,' Gabriella picked up her diet soda as if to prove a point ,' reminder I don't want this to be angry volleyball either .' Jason watched the tableau as if waiting for someone to explode and when no one did, he helped himself to another handful of chips. It was getting super weird and tense again. He had thought they had all finally shaken all of that crap off earlier but nope it was hanging around the backyard. Maybe hanging out as a group wasn't a good idea this afternoon. ' Uh , the multi-plex downtown is showing Footloose ,' brought up Jason, directing this towards his own girlfriend ,' I, uh, just remembered about the matinee so I thought Martha and I could go see it since it's her favorite movie and all .' Martha sent him an exasperated look.' That's a sweet idea, Jason, but I'm not finished here ' Jason stole a glance at his watch.' We have plenty of time ' Kelsi removed her headphones and stared hard at her best friend. 'Don't say it, Martha,' Kelsi held up a hand,' I don't know what's going on any more than you do. This isn't turning out as I had hoped for either which is why I think you should take Jason up on his offer for Footloose ' Martha gripped her hand, fiercely.' He isn't exactly playing the role of the doting boyfriend ' 'Well, I'm not perfect either but your own boyfriend is pretty thoughtful so will you just forget about me and go see your movie with him already, Martha 'stated Kelsi, firmly. ' Kels, he's being a jerk …' 'Goodbye, Martha ….go, pleases.' Kelsi waved at her,' I will call you later ' 'We're going to bail now,' Jason handed Martha her purse,' we'll swing by after to help clean up and all. Thanks for the lunch, Taylor, everyone …..' Resigned, Martha called out her goodbyes to their friends sparing a baleful gaze at Ryan Evans who had resumed his conversation with a seemingly entranced Gabriella Montez as she pondered how she could rectify this situation herself. 'It's none of our business whatever it is that has you riled up, Martha,' Jason cut through her thoughts as he helped her into the passenger seat of the car,' we're steering clear. I'll forget what's been bugging me and you'll do the same /agreed ' 'That was what the party was supposed to be ...not a damn scene from Beverly Hills 90210 ' 'I don't know what that is so it's probably good we're leaving ' While Martha stewed over the possibilities that shouldn't be happening, Taylor lamented the fact that her party was going downhill fast. Zeke yammered on in her ear about the fine art of pastry while he worked his way through his third hot dog, Kelsi had set herself apart from the group focused on their playlist and apparently avoiding them all, and she was convinced Gabriella must have finally gone over the deep end. ' This will go down in history as the lamest , worse party in the history of backyard cook outs ' Chad rubbed absently at the knot of tension in her neck then pressed a kiss against her dark hair. He was hoping the rest of the gang would follow after Jason and Martha and leave them so that he and Taylor could spend some time together. 'Not enough of us here to rate the party, babe,' reassured Chad, trying to be helpful,' if it matters, I am feeling much more relaxed than I was earlier. I think putting the distance between us and the country club was an awesome idea so thanks ' Taylor relaxed in his embrace and they shared a slow, easy kiss until Zeke let out a heavy sigh. 'Sorry,' shrugged the baker,' it's nice, the two of you being happy and all. I just wish it would happen to me in the near future ' 'Give it time, man ' 'Yeah, well, I think I'm starting to run out of that hope I had for that …' said a solemn Zeke ,' so before I depress the rest of the table, I'm going to bring out the cookies.' 'Are you trying to tell me something, Kelsi, or are you just feeling the top break up songs of the early nineties? 'Ryan approached her, lifted a hand at her speaker where Losing My Religion was blaring out in full angst,' Cool songs but might be depressing the crowd ' Kelsi smoothed her lips together in a tight line.' If you don't care for my song choices you can always walk away, Ryan. It's not all that important or anything in the scheme of thing ...' The smile slid from his face as Ryan tried to move to sit with her.' I happen to enjoy debating music with you but why do I get the feeling that I've done something wrong here?' ' You've been hot and cold to me all day so I don't know what would give you that idea at all ,' quipped Kelsi, ignoring the slight quiver in her voice and trying to be aloof ,' you and Gabriella seemed to be having a blast . I certainly didn't want to butt into your fun' Ryan blinked, confused.' Huh? Are you jealous? Is this what it's about?' Kelsi shook her head and began shutting down her equipment much to the puzzlement of Ryan and all of her friends. She refused to give in to her fears and cause a scene. If he and Gabriella were exploring the waters, Kelsi refused to be stuck in the damn middle of it. She had her pride, after all. 'I'm not anything, Ryan,' stated Kelsi, jabbing at the frames of her glasses as she pulled plugs from the speakers,' it's been a long day, I think I lost my mood to party so I am just going to go ' ' We can go together …' suggested a clueless Ryan , reaching for her hand which she yanked away as if it burned her ,' we could maybe take a drive …' 'I don't want to take a drive with you, I'm just going to go home 'stated Kelsi, not giving him room to talk or argue with her.' You do whatever you want, Ryan Evans ' Too confused and lost, Ryan didn't even put up a fight, he just walked away. No one around them knew exactly what had just happened or why but afraid of the consequences that would surely follow .\"][Chapter 15] ['Alex Whitcomb didn\\'t know what the hell he was doing only that he wasn\\'t doing whatever it was back home in Roswell but in Alberquere which was just a literal hop, skip, and car ride from his own hometown . His mind was cluttered with a million little things swirling around in there along with a sort of hazy feeling that made him seem out of sorts. Wasn\\'t he supposed to be en route to the airport for a month long program in Sweden? He\\'d applied ages ago before his life got filled with danger and drama of being friends with the Pod Squad which was respectively the four alien /human hybrids which consisted of Max Evans , his beautiful sister Isabel , Max\\'s best friend , Michael Guerin, and lastly blonde bombshell , Tess Harding . He never would have imagined any of this yet still it blew his mind – it had all happened a year ago when his good friend Liz Parker had been waitressing at her folk\\'s restaurant, The Crashdown Café , a couple of guys had gotten into a fight , Liz had been shot . Max had healed her thus saving her and so began it all, the almost nearly epic daily saga that was Max and Liz, the soul mates of their little circle. Max\\'s best friend Michael, tough as nails and a hothead, battled it out with their sassy free spirited Maria Deluca until their passion had them falling in love with each other . Tess, the other alien, who had been raised by Nasedo, the groups protector until he had been killed, had been Max\\'s wife on their home planet. A Little fact that Max didn\\'t recall at all and rounding out the We Know the Alien Club was Sheriff Jim Valenti and his son, Kyle, whom Max had also healed. It was a wild ride. Alex didn\\'t know why he was being so thoughtful, his head buzzed slightly whether from the heat of the sun or from all of the stuff bombarding his brain, he didn\\'t know. Something had compelled him to pull into the Hubs diner figuring maybe a root beer shake and a burger might help settle him down. Hubs wasn\\'t kitschy like the Crashdown but the aroma of French fries wafted into the air making his empty stomach growl as he found a seat at the empty counter . He perused the menu, his cell phone went off, a quick glance showed that it was from Tess. Don\\'t waste time Alex ignored the message, dropped the phone on the counter, as he rattled off his order to the waitress as the bell above the front door jangled bringing in the pretty brunette he had seen at the park on his last visit here. It had to mean something or maybe she was a part of this too. Funny how he couldn\\'t seem to recall exactly what this thing was supposed to be? Alex rubbed at his forehead, the pounding increasing causing him to wince. \\'Double chocolate milkshake please,\\' called out Kelsi, sliding in beside Alex,\\' Heavy on the chocolate please \\' Alex lowered his hand to meet her eyes, noticing how pretty she was with brown curls, bright eyes beneath framed glasses, and pretty pink lips. She had a kind of quiet beauty despite the funky outfit and instantly thought Liz and Maria would probably like her. She wasn\\'t Isabel but then there was only one Isabel Evans but there was an openness to the young women he could immediately sense. So good, still lucid, not losing my mind, keep it up, oh boy. Alex sent her the patented Whitcomb sweet smile.\\' Rough day, eh? \\' Kelsi managed a rueful half smile.\\' Shows huh? \\' \\'Maybe a little bit ...like a smidge \\' \\' I don\\'t know what exactly it was but it felt pretty horrible so rather than torturing myself , I left the weirdness to come here to drown myself in chocolate ..\\' sighed Kelsi,letting out a heavy hearted sigh,\\' and I\\'m sorry, who are you ?\\' \\'Not a crazed loony, I assure you. Alex Whitcomb of my band, The Whits , just passing through here from, uh, Roswell \\' He wanted to kick himself for acting so lame , not to mention, his band had been pretty much in limbo for months with all the insane alien stuff taking priority over Alex\\'s semi- normal life ,\\' just Alex ..\\' \\'Nice to meet you, Alex. I\\'m Kelsi Nielsen,\\' She folded her arms across the counter , feeling completely out of whack or was she just being foolish ,\\' It\\'s kind of funny you mentioned having a band , I don\\'t one , but I am a musician , too. Um, what brings you here from Roswell? \\' An image of Tess Harding, blonde alien girl, flicked thru his mind along with the book of alien symbols in his backpack then as if he was thinking too hard, it was gone. Feeling pressure behind his eyes, Alex made a face, rubbed tiredly at his forehead, and tried to get it back together. \\'On my way to La Cruces, \\'answered Alex, truthfully,\\' no, I mean, to go to the airport for an exchange program. Made better time than I expected then I got hungry so thought I\\'d stop here to get some diner food …\\' What if his help wasn\\'t at the University but here instead? Tess had imprinted the image of this girl in his head for a reason that was unfathomable to him. Was it possible she was another alien like that Skin Courtney? Or another ally? She looked normal enough to him but then so did his alien friends too so you never knew. Would it kill Tess to be more specific? Did everything have to be mysterious and cryptic? Kelsi knitted her brows together in concern.\\' Are you alright?\\' \\'Nah, I\\'m fine,\\' Alex waved it away casually,\\' headache probably because I haven\\'t anything too eat. Low blood sugar or , I know we just met and all, but if you want to vent, I am a awesome listener. Fun fact my two best friends are both girls so I know you couldn\\'t possibly say anything weirder than from what I have heard from Liz and Maria ….unless you also share a connection to some Czechoslovakians..\\' Alex was grateful for the arrival of his food instantly reaching for his shake as if it were a lifeline. He took a long swig on the thick chocolaty milkshake enjoying the momentary brain freeze all the while musing that Maria made a much better shake at the Crashdown . Kelsi frowned, puzzled.\\' That hasn\\'t been a country for like ten years \\' \\'I know ...believe me, I know \\'Alex munched down on a handful of fries feeling the déjà vu in the room,\\' it\\'s been really stressful in my life lately so going to escape and decompress. You have, um, sad face which makes me think you fought with your boyfriend \\' Kelsi wasn\\'t one to open and share with a virtual stranger yet there was something about Alex that beckoned her to confide in him. He wasn\\'t a threat; he had an open honest face and a kindness behind his intelligent eyes that spoke of knowledge. It was weird but nothing in this entire day had been normal, what was one more thing to add to it? Besides it might not hurt to get an outside opinion from someone who wasn\\'t within her little circle of friends. An objective option. \\'Yes, we fought,\\' says Kelsi on a sigh of frustration,\\' it was our day off from work because me and a bunch of my friends work at my boyfriend\\'s family country club but we weren\\'t together when we got the job. It\\'s a whole thing , I know , and anyway , today was supposed to be practicing for the upcoming staff baseball game , I invited Ryan to come with me but I never heard from him which is strange but Martha and I get to the field , he is already there with Gabriella . I\\'m sorry, am I confusing you? I know you have no clue that any of these people are ….\\' Alex gulped down more shake, only nodded.\\' No, I follow. Believe me I speak Maria so following your train of thought here is a piece of cake, Kelsi . So is this Gabriella making a play for your guy right in front of your face? \\' Kelsi bit her lip, nervously.\\' No...I mean, it didn\\'t look good and Gabriella is the sweetest, nicest girl I know.. We\\'re friends. She\\'s madly in love with her boyfriend Troy who\\'s been acting like a jerk lately but I don\\'t know …..She was being super friendly with Ryan then he didn\\'t want to talk about what was bothering him. It hurt a little but I thought he wanted some space...only he didn\\'t seem to want any around Gabi because he was teaching her a dance and being all flirty. I may be shy at times but I am not blind, it was obvious so I just left the party ...\\' \\'You broke up with his stupid ass?\" assumed Alex, thinking of the ongoing saga that made up Michael and Maria\\'s relationship in comparison. Kelsi\\'s tale of strife and heartache did not sound milder and less intense nor did it have the soulful angst of Liz and Max so really he should be safe to offer his sage advice. \\'I didn\\'t ...i mean, I couldn\\'t handle whatever was going on so I just left ,\\' said Kelsi in a tiny voice,\\' you think Ryan might think I broke up with him ?\" \\'Possibly,\\' admitted Alex,\\' if he was being such a jerk, it\\'s probably for the best. You\\'re positive this Gabriella isn\\'t a snake in disguise? \\' Kelsi played with the straw, idly stirring the ice cream in her glass.\\' I didn\\'t even want to believe or think it was flirting when my best friend pointed out how obvious she was being and well, it was never a secret that Ryan had a crush on Gabi last year and I certainly can\\'t compete with Gabriella Montez. Even if she was acting that way to make Troy jealous, he wasn\\'t even there so how can I believe that either?\\' Kelsi bent her head letting out a disgruntled cry.\\' This is why I avoided dating, it\\'s a mess \\' Alex nodded, thoughtfully. His own relationship or non-relationship with Isabel Evans had him conflicted then befuddled more often than not which is why this trip away from Roswell and all of the insane alien issues was exactly what he needed right now . \\'Ryan wants space then I think you should give it to the guy, let him come to you,\\' suggested Alex,\\' sometimes there are certain people who just don\\'t see what a good thing they have until it\\'s gone. Don\\'t be such a puppy for this jerk, Kelsi ..\\' Kelsi frowned, biting down on her lower lip.\\' You\\'ve known me for all of five minutes but you think I\\'m pleasing like a puppy? You think I am clingy? Oh God! \\' Alex held up his hands in his own defense wincing slightly at her wail of despair. His puppy dog comment might have been a little much; it might have also been more directed towards himself than the pretty musician beside him. This was bad. He had only been trying to help when he should have just called Maria to let her field it. \\'No, no, no,\\' insisted Alex in a plaintive tone of voice, imploring her to give him another shot in the help department,\\' I never meant that in a bad way or to suggest you gave your boyfriend puppy dog eyes. \\'He laughed, nervously.\\' I\\'ve been accused of that myself \\' Apprehension filled Kelsi then reflected in her expressive eyes back at Alex allowing the vulnerability to show through as she measured the advice for the merit it was given. Alex lived in Roswell, he had nothing to gain for offering her his suggestion, and she believed him to be sincere. Maybe she and Ryan had happened too fast, maybe the newness had worn off, or a hundred million scenarios that Kelsi didn\\'t want to contemplate with herself. Alex put down his sandwich on the plate, wiped his hands on a napkin , tossing it on the counter then moved closer to the young woman , as he laid a light hand on her arm . \\' Kelsi, please don\\'t look at me like that with the sadness ,\\' implored Alex, wondering why he suddenly felt protective over a girl he literally just met ,\\' I meant well but truthfully, I don\\'t know anything about your relationship with your boyfriend . I was just trying to help so feel free to completely ignore any or all of that \\' His cell shrilled alerting him of a text message from Tess, he chose to ignore it. Kelsi managed a thin smile that didn\\'t meet her eyes.\\' It\\'s not as if it\\'s a life or death ordeal, Alex, \\'says the composer, pushing her frames back up on her face,\\' my own best friend thinks I should just break up with Ryan . Martha also wants us to start a We Hate the Evans fan club \\' Alex opened his mouth, registering the name, Max and Isabel\\'s last name, shut it, then pondered if it a clue, a connection, a link. Or not because his friends had been adopted by the Evans when they were little kids so it would be weird for an alien connection right here. \\'I have friends back home ...in Roswell ...they are Evans too \\' Kelsi shrugged, pushed her shake around with the straw.\\' Afraid I know nothing of the Evans family tree though to be fair ,Ry is into the whole alien thing as much as I am \\' Alex managed a weak laugh,\\' You and the boyfriend are into, uh, aliens? I mean, you believe in the whole aliens are real thing?\\' \\' Well, I\\'m not a conspiracy theorist or anything like that ,\\' defended Kelsi, her cheeks flushed with pink as she tried to explain herself ,\\' but yeah , I do believe in aliens . I think it would be presumptuous of us to assume we are the only beings on the planet \\' \\'You live in Roswell and you don\\'t? \\' \\' H a ha erm, you live in alien central then answer that question \\' Alex pushed his near empty shake aside chugging the glass of iced water instead all the while taking in Kelsi\\'s take on the aliens. They had all walks of people come into Roswell day in, day out, the crazies, the conspirators, so, nothing really should surprise him yet Kelsi was very matter of fact about it all. While Alex pondered if Kelsi was friend or evil alien, his phone went off again making him grind his teeth together. God, Tess could be more annoying than Maria at time but he knew she wouldn\\'t let up until he responded to her texts. Time is wasting, Alex. Flight to Sweden should be up in the air by now. Move it. The book of destiny awaits your translation. Alex shook his head, rifling through his backpack for the vials of essential oils Maria had insisted he needed with him, pulling out a handful, along with a guidebook to Sweden, map of the University of La Cruces, and the alien\\'s strange unreadable book of destiny that nobody could read. He stacked them up not paying any mind to them as he found the vial of peppermint oil, uncapping it, and running it under his nose as Kelsi looked at him, curiously. \\'Peppermint helps with the breathing or so my friend swears,\\' insisted Alex, collecting his thoughts,\\' feel free to ignore my insane ramblings and horrible advice, Kelsi. It\\'s been nice talking with you but I really need to get back on the road...long way to go \\' \\'Sorry I bugged you with my problems …\\' \\' I\\'ll take your normal problems any day of the week, Kelsi \\' said Alex , picking up the contents on the counter to put back in his bag as her gaze fell upon the book of strange alien symbols with intrest . \\'What\\'s that, Alex?\\' inquired Kelsi, drawn by the strange designs,\\' the book of runes? Are they Mesilako or older? Sorry, I worked as a volunteer on a dig last year with my Dad out in Arizona; I kind of have an interest in that sort of thing ...\\' Something clicked on with Alex as he straightened up; holding the book protectively in his hands, mind warring at this new revelation. Could it be as simple as that? Is that why River Dog hadn\\'t been able to help with the translation of the book? \\'Uh maybe, it\\'s the project I\\'m working on …..So you are familiar with, er, runes?\" Kelsi gave a tiny nod, pushed the food around her plate, happy for the distraction. \\'Well, I\\'m no expert or anything but I know a little bit \\'admitted Kelsi, reaching out as if to touch the book but Alex held it back. Weird,\\' it\\'s like nothing I\\'ve ever seen though \\' What if she was meant to jump start him? Help could be good. Alex made a snap decision. Hell with Tess. He could waste one more day before he went to the University, if he could get help translating the damn book, he would take it. \\' Kelsi, I know we\\'ve just met , you must think I\\'ve lost my mind but here\\'s another wacky idea ,\\' rattled off Alex, pushing through the fuzziness in his mind to the clarity ,\\' what if I got a room at a motel here for tonight . If I treated you to a meal would you mind helping me out with the book …maybe see if you can read any of the runes before I take off? \\' Kelsi stared at him, her argument with Ryan momentarily forgotten; work not on her mind either, as she considered his idea. Alex looked harmless. He seemed nice. It would also put some life back into her; wrecked day plus it might be fun to do something different. Alex held up both hand, palms facing up. \\' I swear I am not a seriel killer \\' Kelsi chuckled in relief.\\' Sure, Alex, I\\'d love to help \\' \\' Thanks \\' Alex offered her his hand , she placed her small hand into his , their gazes holding , unaware that outside the window of Hubs Ryan Evans stood watching the scene with a mixture of bafflement followed by a dash of hurt . He wondered who the hell the guy was that was smiling so damn warmly at Kelsi, debated barging in demanding answers which probably would only piss her off more considering how the day had gone done between them . Ryan needed to apologize to Kelsi but maybe he should wait, see if Kelsi called him herself or bothered to tell him about her new friend. He turned away accidentally bumping into a young man with light brown hair and eerie blue eyes, a pensive expression on his face. \\'Sorry \\' \\'Watch where you are going \\'said the stranger as Ryan walked away from the diner. Nickolas, leader of the Skins, stepped up closer to the glass window of the diner, noting the animated conversation between Whitman and the pretty brunette. It looked more cozy and knew it wasn\\'t a part of Tess\\'s plan – it looked like he might stick around town in case he was needed to remind the human what he was expected of in the name of Antar . \\' Looks like the mind warps slipping already, Tess ,\\' murmured Nickolas , his gaze never leaving the gangly teen from Roswell ,\\' looks like I\\'ll have to fix the nerd Alex for us all \\''][Chapter 16] [\"Ryan hadn't called her and stubbornly, Kelsi refused to give in calling him to find out where they stood in this relationship. She guessed they were at an impasse of sorts. It sucked. Throwing caution in the wind and out of the door, the musician found her turning into the tiny motel just on the outskirts of Alberquere into an empty spot near room 23 where Alex Whitman was staying while in town. She shut the vehicle off, removed the keys, and then just sat staring at the peeling orange paint on the door contemplating if she was being stupid. It wasn't as if she was not here to meet Alex for a bout of torrid sex or anything as remotely exciting or out of character for herself nor did she believe the guy could be a potential serial killer, Kelsi felt that Alex was a good guy. Though she had only just met him, his baggy clothes and self-deprecating humor appealed to her along with the kindness in his eyes. He wasn't a threat to her and Kelsi had learned to trust her instincts. Kelsi gathered up the handful of books on translating runes that her Dad had been working on then reached for her oversized tote bag , blew out a cleansing breath , as she got out of the car strolling over to knock on the door . A rumpled looking Alex answered with a warm smile. ' Kelsi, hi ,' greeted Alex, ushering her inside the room ,' come in . Uh, really glad you didn't change your mind or bring your boyfriend to beat me up for asking you to meet me at a motel cause that would be very bad …for me.' Kelsi managed a nervous laugh taking in the single bed then decided to take the single chair beside a small desk. It definitely wasn't the Holiday Inn but if Alex was on his way to Sweden he probably didn't want to blow his money on a room at a decent hotel. ' I doubt very much that Ryan would hit you ,' stated Kelsi, dryly ,' I haven't even got so much as a text from him so our fight must have been bigger than I thought ..' 'I'm sorry about that,' said an sincere Alex, removing the hands from the pockets of his cargo jeans,' but I appreciate you trying to help me with my, er. Little project ' Alex went to his luggage , removing a package wrapped in a black cloth , then revealed it to be a book of some sort of weird , metal with signs and runes on the cover then sat the book on the desk in front of Kelsi , waiting for her to recognize its contents . Kelsi blinked behind the dark frames of her glasses, pushed them up on her nose, then stared in awe at the strange book then looked up at Alex, puzzled. 'What exactly is this book, Alex? It looks old. How did you get ahold of it? Shouldn't it be in some museum back in Roswell? ' Alex started pacing across the worn shag carpet stopping only once to rub at the headache between his brows before figuring out how much to reveal to this woman. What had he mentioned before at the diner? His brain was getting all blurry again. ' It's called the Book of Destiny ,' admitted Alex, knowing that is what his alien friends referred to the book as being that ,' It's not stolen, Kelsi, I swear to you , I am not a thief . I told you that where I am going...one of the things I have to do is computer work to try to figure out the translation for the book. Its part of the whole work exchange thing I am doing ' He waited a millisecond as if expecting the young woman to have another change of heart while wondering if he wasn't looking for his own way out even though Alex somehow knew it was up to him to translate the book and lives depended on it. Or it was just Tess Harding playing around in his head with her powers of mind warp ability. 'Well, I'm no super computer but we can see if any of these ...Runes match from my Dad's research from the last dig 'Kelsi opening the metal book to reveal drawings of two young men then two young women ,' wow , these drawings are incredible ' Alex noted to himself that it clearly was depicted of the Royal Four must have known exactly what Max , Michael, Tess, and Isabel were going to look like because it really was spot on accurate . He stared at Kelsi again waiting for some sign that she was sent by Tess to help him or was another alien ally but she pulled out her book, a loose notepad of paper, trying to match up any of the runes pictured. He heaved a sigh,' you thirsty? I saw a soda machine in the hallway, I'm just going to grab us a couple of root beers? Or should I get you a diet? ' 'Root beer is fine, Alex, thanks ' Alex sent her a smile then left the motel room, striding down to a small hallway that held a soda machine, a vending machine, an ice maker, and an old washer with a sign that proclaimed it was out of order. Another charming New Mexican motel. 'Alex Whitman,' Nickolas stepped into the alcove with him, his tone dripping with just the right amount of sarcasm and wit. By all appearances, the alien was the picture of a All American 14 year old boy other than what he actually was a leader among his own alien race called The Skins. An old enemy of his friends from their home planet who obviously survived the last fight between them in Roswell,' Vilandra's close friend – Isabel, I know she goes by that now. ' Alex raised his hands in front of him, weighed the situation.' Nickolas, uh, hi. Fancy meeting you here but I have to tell you, Max and the others are not with me so this is a complete waste of your time. You could uh, kill me here and no one would even be aware of it unless that is exactly what you intend to do to me …' Nickolas steepled his hands together, splayed his fingers together, pondering if taking the human out would be feasible. Tess needed the geek for her plan though he couldn't understand the pit stop in Alberquere or his hook up with the pretty brunette . Unless the girl could be the Antarian historian reborn in human form? Perhaps there were more her at play than the Skin was aware of but Nickolas discarded the whole thing as a waste of time. Tess was busy dealing with the Royal Three back in Roswell and if this plan were to actually work, Whitman needed to get back on the highway soon. Nickolas moved forward closing the distance between the tall, wiry young man until they were eye level. Alex blinked but didn't show his fear surprising the Skin. Hmmmm .interesting. He drew up to his full height, closed his eyes, and focused on working altering Alex's mind. 'There is nothing for you here. The girl needn't be involved and is preventing you from doing the task that has been assigned of you, Alex. Dismiss her and get back on the road immediately ' ' W..what ….what the hell ? 'Alex blinked his tired eyes, rubbed at them, and then looking around him realized he was all alone. No creepy Alien threatening him,' I must be losing my mind ' Alex gathered up the cans of soda and junk food then strode back to the motel room where Kelsi was scribbling furiously on a notepad pausing to look up at his return. She chewed nervously on the end of her pen then let out a sigh of relief. 'Oh good your back,' says Kelsi, lightly,' I could have sworn someone was watching me earlier which is totally ridiculous, I know. I was creeping myself out over nothing …' ' I think it's the motel itself , Kelsi ,' replied Alex, peering over her shoulder at her notes ,' oh, you found a few actual words ..' Kelsi shrugged.' Not enough words to actually make out anything this book is saying , I am afraid since I only translated the words 'you' and the word 'created . Are you sure you don't want me to get my Dad? He might be more help to you than I am ' 'No, no,' dismissed Alex, fidgeting with his top on the soda,' I don't want to trouble the man. I shouldn't have asked for your help either though I appreciate all that you have done for me...a stranger ' 'Well I don't work this evening so if you want, we can go over the book together, see if we can figure out more, Alex ' Alex moved to snatch the book away from her, shaking his head, vigorously. He sat the can down on the scarred nightstand along with the book then glanced at his watch, idly. It felt as if his time table had slipped and time was a wasting. 'Thanks so much, Kelsi, but something has come up so I'm going to have to ask you to leave so that I can leave myself. You ought to work things out with that boyfriend of yours ….i understand that obsessiveness is often misunderstood ' Not wanting to overstay her welcome, Kelsi collected her things shoving them in her bag then stared at Alex. She couldn't help but notice the weariness that hadn't been there earlier. 'Are you sure you're alright, Alex?' Alex's smile was sincere.' I'm good just way behind schedule, Kelsi ' 'Well, sorry I couldn't be more help,' Kelsi stretched to place a chaste kiss across his cheek,' next time your passing through here, don't be a stranger. ' 'Same goes if you are ever in Roswell, you can always find me at the Crashdown Café ' With one last look back at Alex, Kelsi left the motel, got in her car, shoving her bag onto the seat, just sitting there, and contemplating the weirdness of everything when her cell phone alerted her to a text. It was from Ryan. I was a total jerk. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me? I'm sorry Kelsi responded back easily enough,' I'm sorry, too. Meet at the park ' As Kelsi started up the car , flipped the radio on , heading back in town towards Ryan , she couldn't help but sing along with the breathtaking beautiful words of the song that echoed around her . Oh I am what I am I'll do what I want But I can't hide And I won't go, I won't sleep Until you're resting here with me\"][Chapter 17] [\"Kelsi's brief encounter with Alex Whitcomb of Roswell , New Mexico , and with weirdness abound had triggered the realization that this tap dancing she and Ryan were currently doing to avoid whatever the problem was needing to stop . If Ryan couldn't even confide in her then how were they to communicate their feelings in a relationship? Granted they had only been together as a couple for a few months but if they actually were only meant to be some short lived summer romance , Kelsi needed to know , needed to end it so she could work on mending her broken heart . Though Ryan's apology text felt real to her, the composer wondered if it really were or simply wishful thinking on her part. The park wasn't busy this early evening so finding a nearby parking space was easy enough , Kelsi parked the car, scanning the lot for Ryan's familiar car , then not seeing it , she decided to take a walk until he arrived . A light breeze ruffled her brown curls as she strolled aimlessly at the playground when a figure with dark hair caught her attention. The girl was dressed in a pair of white capris and a cheerful red halter tank tops her hands clutching the straps of the swings. 'Gabriella,' Kelsi paused in front of her friend,' what are you doing here? ' Gabriella dug a toe of her white sneaker into the dirt before meeting her gaze.' Hiding ' 'From who or should I not ask? 'Inquired Kelsi, folding her arms across her chest. She gestured back towards an empty bench,' if you want to be alone , I can leave .' Gabriella shook her head then gnawed nervously on her lip.' Tonight is supposed to be date night but I think Troy must have gotten a better offer because he canceled on me...again. ' Kelsi smoothed her lips together in a thin line unsure of what to do or say now. She didn't know if saying a bunch of platitudes here would simply fall flat only for the fact that earlier she hadn't felt good thoughts towards Gabriella. 'Maybe you should be having this conversation with Troy rather than with me ' ' Troy must be hanging out with his new college pals or Sharpay ,' said Gabriella , a bitter edge in her tone ,' he doesn't even have the courtesy to return my calls or shoot me off a text .' Kelsi snorted,' Must be a guy thing ' 'What?' 'Nothing, 'dismissed Kelsi, lightly,' Ryan and I had a fight. Our communication kind of went out the door this past week but he's supposed to meet me here to talk about it ...' Gabriella stopped swinging then stood to face her friend, the reality of her earlier actions becoming clear to her. Not to mention the scalding lectures from Taylor made her realize she might have been cause for the fight between Ryan and Kelsi . ' Kels, about the party the other day, I am really sorry about my behavior ,' stated Gabriella , shamed by her blatant flirtation with Ryan ,' I was really furious with Troy , Ryan is so thoughtful and understanding and I think I leaned on him more than I should . I despise when girls do that yet here I am! Argh! ' The composer clenched then unclenched her fist.' Alright but it takes two to tango, Ryan wasn't exactly innocent either, but I accept your apology ' Ryan watched Kelsi and Gabriella from the distance trying to gauge exactly what the situation might be between the friends. He knew that he had mucked things up between himself and Kelsi the other day because he was an idiot. The attention from Gabriella had been flattering and just the ego boost that he had needed but Ryan worried his mistake would ruin his relationship with Kelsi . That was why he hoped to fix the damage prepared to beg if it came down to it and he certainly wasn't too proud to beg. 'Ladies, hope I'm not interrupting …..' Ryan approached the women, cautiously,' thought I'd better see what was going on with you two ' ' Actually Ryan I was just leaving ,' Gabriella rose gracefully to give them privacy ,' I have a wayward boyfriend to track down to see if said boyfriend still wants to be the boyfriend in this relationship . I will talk to you both later. Bye ' With her mind set up finally about her relationship with Troy, Gabriella walked away with the intention of fixing the damage already done leaving Ryan and Kelsi to work through their troubles together. This summer wasn't the dream she had imagined from the start. Ryan moved forward to face Kelsi who stood in a defensive position, arms folded across her face, apprehension clouding her pretty eyes. Apology texts aside this might not be easy. It felt as if the newness and the giddiness of their relationship had moved into uneasiness. Ryan hated it with a damn passion, hated himself for causing it. 'Hi ' Kelsi met Ryan's gaze, worry clearly etched on her face.' Hi ' God when did it get to be so awkward and painful? This wasn't some lame soap opera or Dawson's Creek, this was real life! Ryan dragged his hands across the sides of his jeans as he tried to find the words that he needed to say. He didn't know what the hell he was doing and it sucked. His father, his sister, his whole life had just overwhelmed him with all the crap expected of him and that was just a freaking excuse. Kelsi deserved better than that from him. ' I was a jerk the other day , a big jerk , ' admitted Ryan , as Kelsi watched him warily ,' I didn't know if you'd even want to talk to me , let alone still be with me after the way I behaved at the party . That wasn't really me...okay, it was me but I was in a bad place ' Kelsi's eyes clouded but she refused to give in to the tears. 'We had a fight, Ryan, but honestly, I wasn't sure if you weren't trying to tell me that you wanted to break up with me. 'There was a slight catch in her voice,' especially when you didn't follow me and you didn't call right away, I didn't know what to think …I thought quite a lot actually ' Ryan stepped closer to close in the distance between them, touched her shoulder, felt her tremble. He had fumbled now he had to fix this. Boy he sucked with the sports metaphors. He needed to leave those to his friends, the jocks and be himself. 'I didn't, I don't want to break up, I never did,' swore Ryan, grasping her shoulders with his hands to look at her,' I still don't …I should have just stayed away from the club and from everyone the other day . I had a big blow out fight with my Father about how I could use this summer to experience other interests since Sharpay was managing the talent show this year, I could study the business of running Lava Springs, I could take advantage of his U of A contacts, maybe give sports a try as if I have any intrest in any of that boring stuff? ' Ryan tried to tamper down his hurt.' Because I am obviously just not good enough for the man who thinks the freaking sun shines on Troy Bolton rather than his own son! But I'm smart , he can show me the ropes if I apply myself meanwhile Sharpay is crying about how horrible I am betraying her this summer because I am not her spy any longer ! ' 'Oh Ryan …..i knew you were having problems with your family but I never imagined it was this bad. I wish you had talked to me …' pleaded Kelsi, touching his cheek, gently. Ryan placed a tiny kiss on her hand then stepped away, releasing her from his embrace. 'Mom was trying to play peacemaker, there were a lot of angry words, a lot of expectations for me that I can't ever meet, I felt like I was going to explode,' went on Ryan, winding down now that it was out of his system,' I should have just walked away from the club, went back home, took a road trip, anything but go to that stupid practice with Gabriella ' 'Or you could have told me you needed to be alone, I would have understood ' 'I was feeling so damn much, I was pissed at myself, at the situation, I didn't think, 'continued Ryan, if he were to be brutally honest with her,' it was easy enough to just let Gabi drag me to the field to watch the game. Which was also very, very stupid of me ...?' 'It wasn't smart …..nor does it explain why you couldn't talk to me,' expressed Kelsi, her voice thick with emotion,' Ryan, if we can't talk about the hard times and our problems with each other than how are we going to be together? ' She made a little strangled sound in her throat then walked as she talked.' Troy and Gabriella are the perfect couple, I always thought they were the couple to aspire to be but look at them, Ryan? They aren't communicating at all and we're barely talking ….what does that say? ' Ryan reached out to grab her arm before she could sprint away from him.' Kelsi, stop it! We are talking now. That's what matters here. The way I figure is at some point in our relationship me or you or hell, both of us are going to do stupid things that we're going to fight about...i don't believe that there is a handbook on love ' Kelsi turned, his words stopping her in her tracks, her heart pounding like the beat of the drum, fervently wishing his words were true. It was scary this ledge they were out on with all of those hopes and dreams for them tucked inside waiting. 'Love? 'Whispered Kelsi, lifting her gaze to hold his, the intensity she found there making her shiver in anticipation. She had been holding tight to her own growing feelings for Ryan since the beginning mindful of not rushing or daring to speak the truth of her heart. Ryan turned her towards him, holding her lightly.' Yes, love! I know it's crazy, I know we've only been together a short time but the truth of the matter is that I have been falling in love with you for some time now. You challenge me to get out of my comfort zone, you listen to what I have to say , not to mention you get so wrapped up in your music in such a passionate way – I love you ' Kelsi's pink lips curved slightly around her mouth as she reached up to open the top button on his pressed red button front shirt then slid her hands down the front of his chest . 'You can't just use all of that charm to sweet talk me into forgiving you! It drives me insane that I allowed myself to be jealous about Gabriella because I know better! I know better and I still wanted to strangle you, Ryan, for making me feel that way! ' Ryan's lips twitched into an easy going grin. 'Does that mean you might love me too? ' Kelsi slipped her arms around his neck, holding on tightly. 'I was going to write a song to tell you how I felt about you but I suppose face to face is better. You can irritate me with all your glibness when you've got your back up about something or the other then go be incredibly sweet and absurd the next, and you have no game , period which is really cute . Of course I love you, you doofus ' Their lips met in a heart stopping, soul searching kiss that melded their hearts together then nothing else mattered. Though the summer had been full of the unexpected and was winding down to a close, Ryan and Kelsi were happy, so very happy. Whatever came next for them, they would face together .\"]","Summary":" [\"Disclaimer : I still don't own High School Musical , just playing in New Mexico .

I was still trying to sleep when he randomly jumped onto me and was shouting in my ear, I was so confused as to why he was excited. Oh wait another school where we are famous and for the teachers to give up on me, yay. *note the sarcasm* I got up slowly then stared at my brother. Why had he stayed in my room? L- C\\'MON JAKEYYY IT CANT BE THAT BAD!! I groaned and finished getting changed. J- at least your teachers won\\'t fucking give up on you! Logan sighed and knew what I said was true, he pulled me into a hug and promised that this school would be different. I didn\\'t believe it but I agreed to please Logan. P- BOYS YOURE GONNA BE LATE FOR YOUR FIRST DAY AT EAST HIGH!!!! We both groaned after we realised that we had to find our classes and make friends. Although Logan was excited earlier about school I saw straight through his excitement and was itching for today to be over with. Before we left for the bus me and Logan made a pact. \\' if either of us gets into trouble we will be there for one another\\' Our Mom hurried us out of the door and let us head to school, when we arrived instantly everyone saw us and were shocked as to why two famous vine stars are at their school. We walked straight to the office and was handed our locker numbers and schedules, the secretary then mentioned that we were gonna have people show us around the school. She said that mine was someone called \"Troy Bolton\" and that Logan\\'s was one of his many friends who had moved here a while ago \"George Janko\" as soon as Logan saw a glimpse of George he ran over there whilst I was still waiting for Troy Bolton. He eventually arrived and greeted me, so far he was a pretty cool guy not gonna lie. He showed me around and then showed me all his friends and his girlfriend, Gabriella Montez. T- guys, I want you all to meet? J- Paul, Jake Paul. Everyone except Jake and Troy- Hey! G- I\\'m Gabriella, I\\'m Troy\\'s girlfriend. S- Sharpay Evans and you\\'re a cutie We all laughed and then everyone else introduced themselves. K- I\\'m Kelsi Neilsen S- yeah the geek of the group. I heard her sigh and look down, Sharpay reminded me a lot of my ex. J- sharpay, you may think you\\'re all this and that but that doesn\\'t mean that you can treat her like that! She got pissed and walked away, making I think it was her brother follow her away. K- you didn\\'t have to do that J- no, i did. It wasn\\'t fair on you, plus that used to be me at my old school and I wanna change. I smiled and she smiled back, she was a really nice girl. Z- where are you from? Also I\\'m Zeke, the baker of the group. J- that\\'s really cool Zeke, anyway I\\'m from Cleveland, Ohio. Ja- finally someone else who is from Ohio! We all laughed and then my brother came up and George surprised me, I didn\\'t think that they would speak to me? L- bro, you good? J- I\\'m Gucci bro! Ge- WHATS UP BITCH!!! George practically screamed in my ear, I was still so shocked! J- GEORGE!!! We bro-hugged and him and Logan ruffled my hair and left. J- sorry that was my brother, Logan and his friend George. Everyone nodded their heads and then Troy asked me to see my schedule. T- who is your homeroom teacher? J- someone named Mrs Darbus. T- she\\'s our homeroom teacher as well, c\\'mon we\\'ll show you where to go. Also I think your brother might have the same teacher as us although he\\'s in an older year. We followed Troy to my homeroom and we all walked in and sat in our seats as the bell rang. Logan then walked in and sat next to me, we started talking then Troy and George gave us the heads up to not be on our phones as she will put us in detention. This weird, hippy type lady walked in and welcome everyone back to the school. She then called me and Logan up to introduce ourselves. Mrs. D- okay, I guess we have brothers in here. Logan and Jake Paul can you please come up here and introduce yourselves. We stood up and walked towards the front, we heard many people gasping and saying we were from vine but we couldn\\'t care less. L- okay, I\\'m Logan Paul and somehow me and George met each other again. Also this is my younger brother Jakey! It\\'s honestly really funny on why we we\\'re here so I\\'ll let Jake explain it. J- okay, I\\'m Jake paul and basically we are here because our old teachers from Cleveland Ohio gave up on me and he just came because why not. Also we both do a lot of sports and yeah, also you all might recognise us from Vine. We are those Paul Brothers from Vine. And can we go sit down now as it\\'s meant to be your class and we\\'ve just taken over. The teacher smiled at us then let us sit down. Mrs. D- okay, seeing as you\\'re all back and I have nothing planned we are going to have an art competition! Everyone groaned and I stayed quiet, I liked drawing so I was okay with it. She handed us paper and let us listen to music on our phones and use them for inspiration. I grabbed my pencil and colours and sat there drawing until I got this: I then flipped it around and drew this: When I finished on both sides Logan looked over and was shocked, he then shouted out, \"HOW DID YOU LEARN TO DRAW THIS GOOD JAKEYY?!!!!!\" I felt heat go into my cheeks and I sunk into my chair more and then Troy and Chad looked at my drawings and were in shock. C- THATS AMAZING!! Soon enough everyone was crowded around my table and was admiring my art. Mrs Darbus announced the winner and it was me, I didn\\'t care to be honest. I just wanted to focus on this year and make it count. The bell rang and it was time for Gym! YESSSS! I\\'m actually obsessed with Gym, me and Logan hugged and were going to see each other at lunch. He ran in the opposite direction of the gym because he had maths. I laughed and Troy, Chad, Zeke and Jason all showed me to the Gym. In the male changing rooms: J- So, who\\'s the coach? T- my dad! J- cool! Z- Jake, is it true that your teachers gave up on you? J- among over things, my parents are divorced and my mom is up here with us. My dad stayed in Ohio, and to top it all off my mom doesn\\'t want me and Logan ever going near him. Z- sorry man. J- it\\'s fine, if it didn\\'t happen then I would have never met you guys! We all laughed and then Jason asked. Ja- Jake? Do you miss your old friends from Ohio? T- dude, what kind of question was that? OF COURSE HE WILL. We all laughed and I was getting asked about them. We all finished getting changed and jogged out to the court. Coach Bolton\\'s PoV; When my class all came jogging out I noticed that the JAKE PAUL was in my class. I was really confused as he was the best basketball and football player from Cleveland! What would make you want to leave? I called the lads over and Jake introduced himself more and explained that his teachers from Cleveland said he would amount to anything and that they gave up on him. I felt bad for the kid then I told them all to run 2 laps around the gym, I challenged the older ones (Jake, Chad, Zeke, Jason, Troy etc.) to see if they can sprint it. Only Jake was able to and he carried on for another 3 laps before he finished, and he didn\\'t even break a sweat!!!! Jake\\'s PoV: The real reason I ran an extra 3 laps was because my dad had been trying to get in touch with me and no one else knew, I honestly wished that Chance and Anthony were here!! When I finished the laps and everyone was huddled up together we were all told to get into groups and practise shooting from the 3-point- line. I smiled, playing basketball reminded me of Anthony and my home. We had to get into groups of 5. My group went, Troy, Chad, Zeke and Jason. Another went Graham, Jack, Zac, Corbin and Chris and the last group went Lucas, Drew, Blake, Daniel and Dylan. Seeing as there were 3 groups mine and Lucas\\' group shared a hoop, it alternated between e.g. Me then Lucas, like that. When we had all finished shooting we all got told to go get changed, whilst I was chilling waiting for Troy etc my phone went off. I checked it and my eyes went wide, Jason noticed and asked. Ja- bro, you good? J- IM MORE THEN GOOD!! IM ECSTATIC!! T- why? J- LITERALLY MY BEST FRIENDS FROM OHIO ALSO GOT KICKED OUT OF THEIR SCHOOL AND HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED HERE!!!!'][Chapter 3] [\"Chance's PoV: Me and Tony never realised how easy it was to get kicked out of school! If it was that easy we would have done that ages ago when Jake first got kicked out! We missed him like hell and we prayed that he hadn't forgot about us. When we got home, our parents had decided to send us to Jakes new school! As soon as we fount out I texted Jake: In chat: Pizzy Paul: why have you been trying to call me? IceAge Squirrel: GUESS WHAT? Pizzy Paul: What? IceAge Squirrel: ME AND TONY JUST GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL AND ARE GETTING SENT TO YOURS!!! Pizzy Paul: YESSSSS! IM SO HAPPY RN!!! IceAge Squirrel: we'll be up there in a couple of weeks, we need a new house (both of us) and we need to get accepted! Anyway, got any new friends? Pizzy Paul: a couple, their names are Troy, Chad, Zeke, Jason, Sharpay, Gabriella, Ryan, Kelsi and Taylor. IceAge Squirrel: literally can't wait until we see you bro! We got a flight up there to look around next week so we'll see you soon! Pizzy Paul: I miss you guys sooooo much it's unbelievable! I can't wait like as soon as I see you guys, whether it's during class I will actually get up and hug you guys! IceAge Squirrel: guess who else is moving up there? Pizzy Paul: Are the others acc coming up here?! IceAge Squirrel: they will be over time. Pizzy Paul: I've got to go but I will text you in like 10 cuz it's break after this then 2 more lessons then lunch. IceAge Squirrel: Kk, see you bro. Text Tony cause I'll be with him and his phones always charged completely. Acc call him! Pizzy Paul: Kk bye bro IceAge Squirrel: Bye! End of text When I finished texting Jake I told Tony that he was going to call us. We put my phone on charge and chilled in his room until Jake called us. Me and Tony were thinking about today and how that it was our last day there, we never have to see Mrs Clark again!!! She was such a bitch to Jake like what exactly was he doing wrong? I mean me, him, Tony, Kade, Nathan, Chad, Emilio and Ivan were all acting like the 'Golden Boys' mainly because we were but like we still studied and got the highest on tests. We may have been idiots to people and in class but that's how we learned to not do those things! We made the mistakes so people wouldn't make them, themselves. Jake's PoV: Me and the gang all went to the basketball courts outside and I decided to call Chanthony. On call: J- CHANTHONY!!!!!! Chanthony- JAKEYYYYYY! J- I miss you guys so much! It's unreal! Ch- dude, get these things off of your chest. It'll make you feel better! J- since when did Ice Age Squirrel become so inspirational? Ch- Since I got kicked out of high school! We all laughed and I decided to put them on speaker. J- guys, hold on, you're going on speaker. Chanthony- okay on speaker* Z- hey, Jake. Who is this? J- crap, I forgot to introduce you guys. This is Chance and Anthony, Chanthony, this is Gabriella, Troy, Zeke, Jason, a fellow Ohioan, Sharpay, reminds me of Alissa, Ryan, her twin brother, Kelsi, Taylor and someone else. Sorry what's your name? M- oh I'm Martha! J- thanks, and that's Martha. These are my new friends! Ch- what's up guys? I'm Chance Sutton and this guy is... A- I'm Anthony Trujillo! Ch- dude, we gotta go. We might be getting grounded okay? So if we aren't I'll text u later k? J- Kk, see ya guys. Chanthony and Jake- OHIO!! End of call I was so happy that for the rest of the day I kept on drawing things associated with either Ohio or Chance and Anthony. I couldn't help myself! I wanted to see them so I could explain all my stress to them!! When the last bell rang I was invited to go chill at Troy's with the gang, I accepted and then they let Logan come as well. When we arrived we chilled in his backyard and started playing truth or dare. L- Jakey, truth or dare? J- truth L- are you and Erika still going out? J- yes! C- wait? You're going out with THE ERIKA COSTELL?! J- yeh?! T- good for you bro! J- anyway, Troy. Truth or Dare? T- DARE! Logan and Jake- I dare you to go up to my mom and start being really nosey Everyone laughed and we drove up to my house, we all walked in and I saw this guy. He looked older then my mom. I whispered to Troy to call it off for a bit and go chill in my room whilst me and Logan ask what's up and all that. They all nodded and walked upstairs into my room, Logan took them there then came back downstairs, and me and Logan walked into the Kitchen. J- mom, who's this? P- oh, that's David! D- nice to meet you two, you must be Logan and Jake right? Lj- yep! L- I'm Logan! J- and I'm Jake! D- anyway, Pam wanna tell them? P- Jake, Logan, this is your step father... LJ- SINCE WHEN DID YOU GET REMARRIED AND DOES DAD KNOW?!!! Mom and David stared at us and then the doorbell went soon went to go answer it, leaving us with David. He approached us angrily and then whispered to us. D- You try something to split us up and I'll be digging your graves by the end of the month. GOT IT! He then yanked on my arm and held a tight grip, when he noticed that my Mom had gone outside he tightened his grip and pinned me against the wall with a thud. Logan had tried to get him off of me but he let go instantly and I fell to the floor by the time my mom had walked in. Logan was quite frankly scared of him and so was I, they both helped me up and me and Logan didn't say a word. Once they were in the backyard we dashed upstairs and locked the door, we both collapsed onto my bed and I showed everyone what happened. G- so that's what the thud was!!! Me and Logan nodded and he went to go get me some ice, Troy and Chad went with him in case he tried anything they could film it. They came back upstairs and handed me the ice, I put it on my wrist and it was painful. I winced but then got used to it, we decided to head back to Troy's because we wouldn't want to stay here any longer then what he had to. As we were leaving I got a glimpse of Chance and Anthony, they saw me and came running at me. We hugged and Troy invited them to his as well and their parents let them. J- I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WOULDNT BE HERE UNTIL NEXT WEEK!!! Chanthony- WE CAME EARLY TO SURPRISE YOU!! Logan then hugged them and we introduced them to everyone properly. I was so happy that I completely forgot about what just happened did my bro hand shake with both of them. As soon as I did my arm was in serious pain, they both asked what happened and I told them but as soon as I did David was looking straight out of the window and walked outside and towards us. D- and where in the name of god do you two think you're going? L- Mom let us go round Troy's for a bit. D- introduce me to your friends kids! G- I'm Gabriella T- I'm Troy C- I'm Chad M- I'm Martha K- I'm Kelsi Ta- I'm Taylor S- I'm Sharpay Evans R- I'm Ryan Z- I'm Zeke Ja- I'm Jason Ch- I'm Chance A- I'm Anthony, me and Chance are friends from Ohio. D- okay, I'm David their Step Father and I would like to invite you and your parents to have dinner with us on Friday. I would like to meet them as I want to see who my kids are with. J- I like that you're taking an interest into our lives but we ain't your fucking kids. You aren't our dad so stop acting like him! And with that I walked into the house and it left Logan to apologise to them for me. I knew that Chance and Anthony came running after me but I didn't care, I was pissed that he is acting like my dad when he clearly fucking isn't. I ran into my room, slammed the door and punched the wall over and over again until I felt someone grab me, I realised that it was Chance and slowly started relax but I couldn't properly. Anthony then stood in front of me and guided me over to my bed and sat me down on it, I laid down on my bed with Chance one side and Tony the other. Ch- dude, let us see your hand I showed them and I heard Tony sigh, he then went downstairs to get me an ice pack whilst Chance was confused as to who they just met and what happened. J- I'm so fucking done man! I like it here but I miss Ohio. It ain't the same and I can't deal with this!! Ch- bro, that's why we came early. Your mom and Logan told us that you have been showing signs of stress so we came here. And we will get to see you tomorrow at school! J- are you serious right now? Ch- yep! J- I'm so glad that you both are back in my life rn! I wanna explain EVERYTHING but it's like, I dunno like touchy if you get what I mean? Ch- yeah I do. Dude, your dad hasn't looked worse. He was talking to me and Toner before we left and said that he really badly wanted to see you and that he couldn't wait until he got the chance to. I sighed and closed my eyes, I wanted this day to be over with but that means that I would have to say goodbye to Chanthony and I didn't wanna. Tony came back upstairs and my mom followed with Logan. P- Jake? J- what? P- what did you do to your hand? J- nothing you should be concerned about! Anyway how come you've only just decided to tell me and Logan about our step father?! P- because I didn't know how you both would handle it!! J- Also he invited our friends' parents with them over for dinner on Friday! Right as I said that David came walking up the stairs and had a grin on his face, when he saw my hand he started acting like my dad. It was getting me pissed so I just backed away from him and said, J- like I said earlier, I appreciate that you're trying to be nice but you're acting exactly like my dad! And you ain't my dad!! And with that he walked out and my mom went after him. I was tired of his shit! A- hey, come round mine then we'll go to Chances and say hi yeah? Ch- I'm down J- thanks, let's go! Logan you coming? L- yeah, why not?! And we left my hell hole and walked to Tony's and said hi to everyone. J- HEY MR TRUJILLO!! Tony stared at me but then we all started laughing as he looked away. When Tony's dad came out he smiled and hugged me as I hadn't seen him since I left Ohio! ???- Jake, Ive told you a million times not to call me Mr Trujillo. Call me Brad! We all laughed and I nodded my head. J- sorry brad... B- sounded better when you call me Mr Trujillo We all laughed again and then I remembered that my step dad invited him round to dinner on Friday. J- oh yeah, Mr Trujillo my step dad invites you to come have dinner with us on Friday, dunno the time yet but when I find out I'll text Tony. B- I'm sure that'll be a good idea! And I never knew you had a step dad J- neither did I until today! I shrugged my shoulders and as Tony's dad was looking down to tie his shoe lace he caught a glimpse of my hand. As he was doing his shoe lace he asked me about my hand. Great. B- so, Jake, what did you do to your hand there? J- got frustrated and punched a wall! B- okay, how many punches did it take till you dented the wall? J- 3! Ch- I swear your dad knows more about him then us Tony! A- YEAHHHH!! What gives dad? We all laughed and we talked for a bit before we said hi to Chances parents. We then left Tony's house and walked to Chances who's was right next door. Ch- MOM! I FOUNT A WILD JAKE PAUL ROAMING THE STREETS!!! CAN WE KEEP HIM??? I hit him in he back of the head playfully and laughed at his expression, Chances Mom soon walked around and hugged me! ???- OMG JAKEYYYYY!! We've missed you! How was your first day at East High today? J- it was alright! How was your flight here? Crystal- OMG IT WAS AMAZING!!! Me and Chances mom had a really nice conversation until I thought about going back to mine, Logan had left earlier to go to George's after saying a quick Hello to both of their parents. I then left and walked back to mine, once I walked inside I heard this yelling and it sounded familiar. I walked into the kitchen to see someone I didn't want to see...\"][Chapter 4] ['Gregs PoV: As I came to Albuquerque I knew she wouldn\\'t take me back, I just had to say goodbye to my kids once and for all. I came by earlier and saw this Jeep, Pam answered when I knocked the first time and told me to go wait in the bush there so no one (Jake and Logan) would see me. When I heard a door slam I saw that Jake and Logan were with friends, that\\'s my boys!! I missed them like crazy and was fighting the urge to go and hug them, I knew that they would never want me in their lives again but I wanted to be apart of it and if that means earning their trust again so be it. When I saw Chance and Anthony I knew that Jake would have cried if it was just them three, I know him so much that I knew how\\'d he\\'d react to me coming here and it\\'s safe to say not in a good way. When they all left again I finally saw this man start acting like me?! I\\'m guessing that Pam got remarried and that was their step dad, as soon as I saw Jake run off I was heart broken. HE HATES HIM! It was 10 minutes later until Jake, Chance, Anthony and Logan came out and I saw Jakes hand, he punched a wall. They all walked over to Chances I think and went inside, there was my chance to see my ex wife and talk to her about saying my final goodbye to Jake and Logan. I walked inside and thought that the house looked nice! I saw her comforting their step dad and I approached with ease. Gr- I\\'m not here for trouble guys, I wanna say a final goodbye to my boys as I didn\\'t get to see them when they left. P- Greg, nows not the time! You should have done that when they left!! G- sorry, it\\'s not my fault that their mother wouldn\\'t let me say goodbye is it?! P- SERIOUSLY ITS NOT MY FAULT!! G- then who\\'s is it? Cause if I remember correctly when I had to talk to you with all the goddamn lawyers you clearly said \"I don\\'t want this man near my children ever again\" why? What have I done wrong?! P- I DONT WANT THEM NEAR YOU BECAUSE WHERE WERE YOU ALL THESE MONTHS?! PROBABLY WITH SOME RANDOM GIRL GETTING HER PREGNANT AS WELL LIKE YOU DID ME! G- ARE YOU BEING FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?!! THAT WAS MONTHS AGO WHEN YOU STRAIGHT UP SAID THAT YOU NEVER WANTED TO SEE ME AGAIN AND NOW YOU\\'RE COMPLAINING THAT I WASN\\'T THERE FOR THEM! J- WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?! Gr- hey son... J- DAD!?! Gr- bet your wandering why I\\'m here?! J- I don\\'t care why you\\'re here I\\'m just glad you are! Jakes PoV: We hugged and stayed like that for awhile, I just wanted my dad back and here he was! I was on the verge of crying when he said this next part. Gr- the court doesn\\'t want me near you guys anymore so I came to say my goodbyes! J- dad... I love you so much that I literally won\\'t be able to last not seeing you... He held me tight and let me cry into his chest and then Logan walked in. L- dad... I didn\\'t realise it but I left my phone round Chances so him and Tony came round to drop it off when they walked in I knew that they were as gobsmacked as Logan. Logan soon joined in and we both said our goodbyes to him, I couldn\\'t believe that he was leaving. As soon as he left Chance and Anthony pulled me into a hug and we stayed like that until I pulled away from their embrace and cleaned myself up. When I came back my mom had invited them and George over for dinner and they were all allowed so we had all of our old friends here! Dinner ended a while ago and me and Logan were chilling in our room. It looked like this: I laid on my bed and closed my eyes, Logan looked over at me and smiled. I then drifted off to sleep, dreaming about Ohio. Logan\\'s PoV: 6:00am* It was 6 am and my alarm was going off, I switched it to snooze and woke up properly. I sat up in my bed and looked at my brother who was still asleep, I went over to him and woke him up. J- Logan? What\\'s the time? L- 6 am bro! J- thanks And with that he slowly got up and went downstairs with me. We saw David making all of us breakfast and I told Jake to apologise to him about all of this, thankfully he tried and David accepted and now they are on good terms. By the time we had finished getting changed and ate breakfast it was time to leave, we left and caught the bus on time instead of being late like yesterday. We arrived at school and met with our friends, well Jake went with Troy etc whilst I went with George, Mark, Evan and Chloe. Chad\\'s PoV: When we all arrived at school I was a little shocked to see that Jake and Logan were on time but that was only because they were a little bit late yesterday. I was super excited for after school as it was tryouts for the basketball team and then tomorrow was the tryouts for football. Jake met up with Chance and Anthony and we all became close friends with them. T- guys, what did you exactly do to get kicked out? J,ChA- a lot of things C- how many fights? J- 20 Ch- 8 A- 8 J- did you and Chance fight each other? Chanthony- no, just had the same amount of fights. J- I also kept on getting in trouble with my teachers, back chat, swearing, skipping class, skipping school. The lot T- so basically you three were the naughtiest kids in the school?! JChA- pretty much. Ch- we had this group which consisted of us, Kade Spieser, Nathan Spieser, Emilio and Ivan Martinez, Chad Tepper, at times Nick Crompton and that\\'s it! C- so basically it was like a golden boy type group? J- pretty much. G- what are you guys talking about then? T- well, you are looking at the Golden Boys from Cleveland Gabi. G- what? J- we were the naughtiest boys from Cleveland! Ta- we honestly don\\'t believe you! Chanthony- ask mark or Logan or George they\\'d all say it. And with that they walked away and left us to believe that they were the trouble makers they said they were. We were all waiting in homeroom for Mrs Darbus to come a lecture us and Chance, Anthony and Jake hadn\\'t arrived yet so I took the liberty to check with Logan and George to see if they were. L- what\\'s up Chad? C- is it true that Chance, Anthony and Jake were all the naughtiest kids from your old school? L- it\\'s brutally true! Like I have so many videos of him getting into fights like it\\'s unreal. I\\'ll send them to you later. C- K, thanks. I walked away and told Troy what I fount out. C- FYI all that stuff they said is true, Logan\\'s sending me videos of him getting in fights later. T- he\\'s such a cool and relaxed guy, I don\\'t understand why he would do that. C- I would say ask him but we don\\'t know how personal it could be. T- true! The bell rang and we sat down, suddenly all 3 of them walked in and Jake had a note as to why they were late. Somehow Mrs Darbus accepted it and then they sat down. During the entire homeroom Jake had sat with them and he just drew? He was drawing something and it caught Logan\\'s attention. Soon enough everyone had crowded around him and was looking at it. J- you all can relax, it\\'s only us with the Ohio flag. As soon as he said that everyone sat back down and let them be. L- Jake, how much do you miss Ohio? J- a lot and I\\'m fine, go sit down before you get shouted at! He then came over and sat down, we looked at him and Logan said simply. L- he misses Ohio, quite a bit. We all nodded and soon enough the bell rang for English. Anthony\\'s PoV: Me and Chance checked our schedules, crap, we had English with a teacher named... oh fuck no no no no... not the teacher we drove out of our old school!! A- guys... we have Mr Kennedy next... Ch- wait... the mr Kennedy?! J- oh god... C- guys, he\\'s a really good teacher! JChA- WE DROVE HIM OUT OF OUR OLD SCHOOL! They all looked shocked and we entered the classroom with our heads down... We took our seats at the back and then he did role call. Mr K- Jj? Jj- yo Mr K- Logan Paul\\'s ludicrous younger brother. J- seriously, you\\'re still mad? Mr K- YOU MADE ME LOOSE MY JOB! A- more like you quit! Mr K- Screw my life, the trio from Ohio\\'s here! Ch- hey!! We were only asking if you were still mad! Take a chill pill! Mr K- Troy? T- Hi Mr K- Chad? C- PRESENT! Mr K- Jason? Ja- hey Mr K- Zeke? Z- how ya doin\\' Mr K- Martha? M- Here! Mr K- Deji? D- sadly here! Mr K- is that everyone as I only have a small register!? T- I swear that\\'s everyone! Mr K- okay, thanks Troy. Now as it\\'s our first lesson together I was thinking we could relax, and write a paragraph about our lives! Everyone groaned and Me and the boys took this opportunity to be our old selves! J- do I have to fucking do this Chris? Mr K- HOW DID YOU FIND OUT MY NAME?! A- it\\'s not rocket science you tit wank. Mr K- boys, don\\'t do this again! Remember what happened last time?! JChA- we got away with it! Mr K- really? Ch- no shit Sherlock, we only said it for the fun of it. No duh, I swear we should have a lot worse to you! Mr K- YOU THREE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW! JChA- NO! J- why should we? You\\'re a fucking pedofile so why should we?! Ch- we literally have a video of you fucking a teacher and them saying that they didn\\'t want it and that you came onto them! Everyone in the class gasped and watched us fight the teacher pretty much. By the time it was break we managed to traumatise him which we thought was hilarious! We were all hanging at the basketball courts when we randomly got asked. C- guys, was that how you used to be? J- no, that is a small bit of how we used to be. Ch- like we said, we got in a lot of fights. Well Jake did and we always jumped in if anything happened, the worse one he\\'s had is when his girlfriends ex was calling her a slut and a prostitute and it pissed him off so he fought him and walked away with a bruised nose and a broken fist. C- what happened to the guy he was fighting? J- in the hospital on life support! He is better now and knows never to call her those again otherwise I\\'d kill him. T- what caused you all to act that way anyway? J- at our old school when we were really naughty we had a sub for his class and it was because he was raping a teacher, and like we filmed it as we skived class and we said. \"The next time we see you, you better let us do what we want otherwise I\\'m posting this video\" and bamn here we are! Z- you guys trying out for the basketball team? JChA- yeah! T- I\\'ve been the co captain alongside Chad and we get to pick who\\'s on the team, so we\\'ll see what we can do but we need to see you guys play before anything starts! Ja- wait, I swear Jakes the best football player in the country, Chance is the best soccer player in the country and Anthony is the best basketball player in the country. L- it\\'s true! Logan said joining in. J- HOLY CRAP LOGAN! Everyone laughed and we all walked to Maths, we all had different teachers except me and Tony as we are the smart asses in the group. We walked in and sat down, the teacher didn\\'t even acknowledge us! YESSSS! Me and Toner day next to each other at the back and were messing around, she eventually gave up on teaching us, fuck another teacher!, and sent us to Chances class. Man that was a huge mistake, everyone who was supposed to be on Chances row wasn\\'t there so we sat next to him. During class we all agreed to shout OHIO in the middle of it. next part whispered* J- 3 Ch- 2 A- 1 not whispered, shouted* JChA- OHIO! Everyone laughed and the teacher stared at us, she then looked back at her computer and somehow survived us in her class. I know everyone wants to know why I\\'m acting like this, well it\\'s because things at home aren\\'t great. The whole reason why I didn\\'t explain dinner was because my mom and step dad started to fight and mine and Logan\\'s names kept on being mentioned. (A/N: not about me it\\'s Jakes PoV so that\\'s what happened at his dinner. ) I felt really uncomfortable so we started acting like all hard because that makes me feel like I\\'m back in Ohio instead of being in this new state. I knew as soon as the golden boys turn up here, all hell will break loose...'][Chapter 5] ['Kade\\'s PoV: When me, Chad, Emilio, Ivan and Nathan all stepped off the plane and into the airport we were thinking, DAMN ITS HOT HERE. No one except Logan knew we were coming today, it had been 3 months since we had last seen Jake, Chance and Anthony and were excepted into their new school. I don\\'t understand the hassle of being kicked out, just transfer! Well they are the trio so I\\'m guessing that they would go out in style. We got Uber\\'s to our houses and all got invited to Anthony\\'s House by his dad, I guess more people were in on it then I thought. B- guys, Jake, Chance and Tony have all started acting like the bad boys of the school! Ka- how many fights? B- Jakes had 12, Tonys had 5 and Chance has had 7 N- but why? When I called Tony he said everything was fine! E- and when we text him, he say it\\'s fine and then says bye I- Jake says he\\'s fine but then I hear screaming and he ends it and doesn\\'t text me for days. Chad- somethings going on for definite! I mean why would they go back to this? Is anything happening here or at home for this to happen? B- not here, most likely Jakes. I don\\'t know what changed them! E- we go to school with them now, don\\'t we? I- yeah, Emilio! Chad- well not right now, it\\'s Sunday. We have to go back, sleep and then go school and see what we can do. Even if it means re making the golden boys... I heard everyone except Chad gasp, he was correct. We need to re make the golden boys to get closer to them again and find out what\\'s up. Ka- guys, he\\'s right. We need to make the golden boys again, as much as I loved it when we were in Ohio we have have to do it so then we can get them back! We all agreed to get the boys back and so we told our parents and they weren\\'t going to ground us because of this. They supported it and we all fell asleep, dreaming about how the boys will be back. Jake\\'s PoV: I sighed and slapped my alarm clock, after being suspended for a couple days and being in seclusion and being on report it really took a tole on me. I mean, the only reason I\\'m acting like this is because of family shit that only Chance and Tony know about. That\\'s the whole reason why we act like this, I have so much anger built up that I use it in class and then Chanthony does it as well to make it seem as if they\\'ve turned me back when in reality I\\'ve turned them back. I got up and got changed into this: With dark blue, ripped jeans. My hair stayed the same, I walked downstairs and saw David. Ughhhhh, he\\'s such a dickhead! He\\'s been trying to talk to me about this but why should I tell him? After all he\\'s the one who caused all of it! D- Jake, what\\'s going on?! We all wanna be there for you but we can\\'t if you keep us in the dark. J- forget it... And with that I walked out of my house and knocked for Tony then Chance, we walked to school together. Before we got to school Tony asked me what happened last night and I explained it. J- basically, David and My Mom were fighting again! And like I heard it and they were saying like that maybe my mom and dad should get back together and that it like should be a good idea for me to see my dad! A- sorry bro! And I have even worse news JCh- what? A- Alissa is coming to school... she\\'s moved and she\\'s in our class for everything... J- KILL ME NOW!!!! Ch- she told me that she wants to get back together with you! J- if I go stand in the street maybe I\\'ll get hit, hopefully I do! Chanthony- sorry bro... J- it\\'s fine, as long as she doesn\\'t fuck my brother if we end up getting back together it\\'s fine! Also you spoke to Erika? Ch- she\\'s still heartbroken although she was the one who broke up with you. J- okay, whatever... A- you been cutting? J- nope! Ch- you sure? J- I\\'m one hundred percent telling the truth! A- good on you! Lie. That was so easy to lie to them, I was getting hot so I took my hoodie off and I had forgot to put a top on underneath so I stayed shirtless. Chance and Tony did it as well because I knew that they wanted to show off to the ladies. As we walked into the school I saw my best friends... (A/N: Logan had to drop out because he got a full scholarship to a football college and he was meant to be in college then but got put in school with Jake.) JChA- CHAD, EMILIO, IVAN, KADE, AND NATHAN?!! They all turned around and stared at us shirtless, we laughed, we put our bodies back on and hugged them. Ka- dude, wanna remake the golden boys?! J- HELL YEAH! WOOOOOHOOOOOO THE BOYS ARE BACK BABY!!! Everyone looked at us as I had screamed it but as soon as I looked at them they all turned away, apparently we had taken the title of kings of the school away from Troy, Chad, Zeke and Jason but we didn\\'t care. Me and the guys were safe we just never talked to each other anymore, we drifted apart and it all started when all my friends parents met my step dad. Flashback* Me and everyone, except my step dad, was eating Chinese and suddenly he appeared and started being really rude and was being really offensive. I hit my head with the palm of my hand and apologised for his behaviour and then suddenly he started talking saying that I apparently don\\'t like them and all of that so he pretty much ruined my life single handily. And that\\'s one of the main reasons I\\'m like this now. end of flashback* I was brought out of my daze by Kade clicking his fingers together right in my face. Ka- bro you good? You spaced out for a second there. J- yeah I\\'m fine I slightly smiled at him then suddenly the one person who I didn\\'t want to see was here! Ali- JAKEYYYYYY!!!! J- ALISSA?! Ali- IVE MISSED YOU SOOOO MUCH!! J- actually you miss sex and my brother. Ali- I miss being with you!!! My life\\'s been crap ever since we broke up! J- YOU STARTED IT! You cheated on me with my own brother and I walked in on you two doing it! Ali- PLEASE TAKE ME BACK!!!! I swear I\\'ll never do it again with anyone (you know). I sighed and threw my head back, the guys had my back and said that I would think about it. She hugged me and ran off, what have I gotten myself into. J- thanks guys. E- that\\'s what friends are for! Ka- let\\'s make a pact. Everyone except Kade- sure! Ka- we are brothers and we tell each other everything! No matter what! Everyone except Kade- DONE! J- instead of being called the golden boys let\\'s be called Team 10? X except Jake- deal! Ka- can Tessa, Erika, Mackenzie and Alex all be part of it as well. I mean they are part of the squad. X except Kade- Sure! Ch- we might have to add Alissa though because Jake and Alissa could still get back together! X except Jake- #JALISSA J- I hate you guys so fucking much, actually I\\'m gonna take her back! Let\\'s go tell her! We all walked towards Alissa and she looked nervous, Ali- are you giving me an answer? J- yep, and I will. You can cheat on me with people if you want I don\\'t mind! We hugged and I kissed her in the cheek. I held her hand we walked into Homeroom boyfriend and girlfriend, she sat next to me and we flirted the entire time. She somehow tamed me and that impressed my teachers! By the end of the day I had managed to get my work done and be good! Why did she make me good?! Although I loved being happy I wanted to be bad not good! Ughhhhh I think Alissa Violet made me soft. Alissa\\'s PoV: The only reason I asked Jake to take me back was because Erika had a plan, a very sneaky plan which meant we had to be uneasy allies. As much as I hated her I had to give her credit, her plan was something I would make. You see when me and Jake were dating in Ohio Erika had seen me having sex with other men and videotaped me leaving their house and took photos and she threatened to post them if I didn\\'t do it. I respected her and knew she would do it so I listened and I gave Jake my \"new phone number\" when in reality it\\'s was Erika\\'s new one and so she could then text him. When it came to like FaceTime and all that we would say that my camera and microphone was broken so then it would slip by. Her plan was simple: 1) Get Jake to take me back 2) Give him the number 3) \\'Text\\' him 4) wait for her to come up to Albuquerque 5)let her catch me cheating on him with Logan (who was in on the plan) 6) get closer with Jake 7) find out what\\'s going on with him 8) BAMN! He\\'s back and make him be happy! I texted Erika knowing that the first and second phases were done and that we could move onto the third part. Start of chat: TrickyRik: Hey, how was the plan? Alissy: he fell straight into the trap, he said that he would take me back and that he wouldn\\'t care if I cheated on him with other people TrickyRik: okay, well you need to play bf and gf for 2 more days okay? Alissy: okay! Also he\\'s got the number. TrickyRik: Kk thanks for doing this, after this is done I\\'ll delete the videos and photos so then I can\\'t accidentally post it cuz I\\'ve done that before! Alissy: np and thanks TrickyRik: gtg he\\'s texting me Alissy: good luck! End of text I feel bad that we have to lie to Jake but we need to old Jake back before he gets kicked out! The backstory as to why we don\\'t want him to get kicked out is because his own dad said \"I will kill myself if he gets kicked out of another school!\" And we all know that Jake wouldn\\'t want that! Everyone who either is or was friends with Jake, knows and is going to start getting closers or at least trying and are eventually when Erika gets here she would tell him. Jake\\'s PoV: I started texting this number that Alissa gave me and I recognised it from somewhere, the last time I saw it was on Chances phone when it said \"TrickyRik️\" I played along and knew that she would come up here, her and Alissa made a plan to do this and to be honest I really wanted Erika back. I couldn\\'t deal with this anymore! I had to text Rik as the suspense was killing me! I messaged her on Instagram: @erikacostell: what\\'s up Jake? @jakepaul: I know that you and Alissa made a plan @erikacostell: how? @jakepaul: I looked at Tony\\'s phone and your number matched the one she gave me @erikacostell: guess you want me to explain it to you huh? @jakepaul: that would be nice. @erikacostell: I was gonna get Alissa to ask for you back and you took her back which was in the plan. She then gave you her \\'new\\' number which you fount out it was mine and the next couple steps go you were supposed to wait for me to go up to Albuquerque and then catch her \\'cheating\\' on you with Logan, who knows, and then we were supposed to get closer and then I would find out and help you and get the old Jake back! @jakepaul: do you still like me Erika? @erikacostell: yessss, I love you Jake Joseph Paul! I regret breaking up with you!! @jakepaul: I never stopped loving you Erika and I never will️ @erikacostell: wanna be my boyfriend again? @jakepaul: aren\\'t I supposed to say that? @erikacostell: you know I ain\\'t big on stereotypes! @jakepaul: here\\'s the thing will you be my girlfriend? @erikacostell: OF COURSE️ @jakepaul: looks like your plan worked️ @erikacostell: what do you mean? xx @jakepaul: your goal was to make me happy and you\\'ve just made me the happiest man alive️ @erikacostell: I missed your cheesy jokes️ @jakepaul: I missed this️ @erikacostell: looks like my lil dinos back!️ @jakepaul: got that right! My lil goat️ @jakepaul: gotta go, my mom and step dad are threatening to kill each other. Love you Rik️ @erikacostell: love you my dino ️ Erika\\'s PoV: I CANT BELIEVE I JUST GOT THE LOVE OF MY LIFE BACK! I\\'m over the moon excited, i get to see him tomorrow and it\\'s the best!️ I need to tell Alissa to cancel the plan as he figured it out. Start of chat: TrickyRik: abort the plan! I repeat abort the plan! Alissy: what why? TrickyRik: Jake figured it out, the number you gave him matched the one in Tony\\'s phone and it got linked to me. Alissy: so are you two together now? TrickyRik: YESSS WE ARE!!! Thanks for this Alissa, before Jake fount out I deleted the videos Alissy: thanks! Luckily only the Golden Boys saw Jake take me back so we only have to convince them. Can we be cool, I know I\\'ve done a lot of messed up shit to you but I was jealous. TrickyRik: of course we can! Me and Alissa stopped texting each other and I ran around my house screaming, I had Mackenzie, Kade\\'s Gf, Alex, Chances Gf, Tessa, Tony\\'s gf and Kelly, Nathan\\'s crush, over and they all looked at me and asked what\\'s going on. Te- rik? What happened? You okay? Rik- ME AND JAKE ARE BACK TOGETHER! Everyone except Erika- awwwwww #JERIKA!!! I blushed deeply and then Jake called me, I answered it but went in a different room in case it was personal. On call: J- yo... Rik: Jake? What\\'s happened? J- I don\\'t fucking know anymore like my mom and step dad are arguing still, he pinned me against the wall and my mom watched and didn\\'t do jack shit! Apparently I\\'m grounded for saying to my mom and step dad that they need to relax! Like I acc hate my life rn... Rik: awwwww baby️ I wanna be there for you but I don\\'t fly out until next week J- can you hear the shouting? Rik: sadly... J- it\\'s like fucking Ohio all over again, why does every single fucking guy my mom marries, ends up getting into fights with her like I hate it! Rik: I love you and remember that! Please don\\'t do anything stupid!! J- too late for that. Rik: Jakey?... J- there is now a massive hole in my wall and my hand I\\'m very sure is broken... Rik: Jakeyyy, I\\'ll be there soon. Hang tight please. Look, I\\'ve got to go but I can still text okay? J- nah it\\'s fine, I\\'ll sneak out to Chances. Thanks though. Rik: you\\'re welcome my little Dino End of call, I sighed and walked out of the kitchen, I sat in the couch and shut my eyes. I can\\'t believe that he has to go through all of this alone as Logan has been sent to College. Everyone in the room could tell something was wrong so Tessa pulled me into her, my head was in the crook of her neck and let me cry. Te- Rik? What\\'s happening with Jake? Rik: he has a step dad and now him and his mom are arguing and Jakes like given up! Tessa looked shocked and held me, we all prayed that Jake hadn\\'t done anything else to himself. Te- Rik, where is he? Rik: he said he snuck out to Chance\\'s Te- go get some rest, I mean after all you\\'re going to see the love of your life! I smiled, walked upstairs, got changed and fell asleep dreaming of Jake.'][Chapter 6] ['Troy\\'s PoV: Ever since that first dinner where our parents met Jakes step dad something had felt off the entire time. Jake seemed less happy and more agitated with each passing day, we\\'ve all tried talking to him but he either doesn\\'t respond or changes subject. It\\'s painful to see someone who I used to know turn into this person who I didn\\'t know existed. Since Jake became bad again he\\'s been in 30 fights, excluded 3 times, suspended 2 times and put on report 40 times, altogether that adds up to 75 complaints in the space of what? Like 3 months?! He\\'s crazy, we\\'ve all started blaming Chance, Tony, Kade, Nathan, Ivan, Chad T, Emilio and Alissa. They all of a sudden arrive and the bad side of Jake Paul comes out, Deji, JJ\\'s little bro, had started chatting about Jakes gf and today he was gonna bang him out. He was saying the exact same things that his gfs ex was saying. But worse, he started calling her all of these, \"prostitue, slut, sket, hoe, fuckgirl\" he\\'s also been saying \"He\\'s gonna have to fuck her like a prostitue!\" He really hates Jake and I know Jake can easily take him but he would have to deal with JJ but I\\'ve fought JJ before and he\\'s really easy. It was 5th September, 2015 and we were all walking to school when we all saw Erika... What was she doing here?! Now that me and Jake started talking again he had told me to make sure that Erika didn\\'t see the fight and of course I was gonna listen. I ran straight up to her and she started staring at me, very uncomfortably. Rik: and you are? T- attitude much?, sorry I\\'m Troy Bolton. Look I know you\\'re Jakes gf so I came here to say hi and welcome you to east high! Rik: thanks, my names Erika Costell. Have you seen Jake? T- nope, doubt he\\'ll be here on time tho. Rik: okay, do you know where Mrs Darbus class is? I have to meet Tony there! T- you and Tony go back? Rik: me, Jake, Alissa, Kade, Tony, Chance, Ivan and Emilio, Chad and Nathan all came from the same school. T- wow, so you and Jake have been high school sweethearts then? Rik: you could say?! T- there\\'s Tony! I pointed to Tony, she thanked me and she walked away with him. I was nervous as I didn\\'t want her to see the fight but at the same time I did want her to stop it because if Jake truly loved her then he wouldn\\'t fight him. Tony\\'s PoV: I can\\'t believe that Erika\\'s actually here!! Jake will be over the moon to see her! I told Chance to make sure Jake makes it to school on time. A) he can see Erika, B) we all won\\'t have to wait long for Deji to end up in the hospital. Jake arrived 30 minutes before the bell and was complaining on why he had to be early. Chance dragged him into Mrs Darbus classroom where we set up for the entire squad to be, as soon as he set foot in the classroom he was shocked. Erika came running straight at him and they hugged, he held her as it brought tears to everyone\\'s eyes. We then forced Nathan to ask out Kelly as you could clearly tell that they liked each other. N- um Kelly? Would you make me the happiest guy ever and go out with me? K- OMG YESS A MILLION TIMES YESS!!! They hugged and Nathan kissed her on the cheek. They got all cuddled up together as did everyone else with their boyfriends. Rik: Boys, we all want you to stay in this school so we WILL break up with you all if you get kicked out! Ka- that\\'s a little extreme don\\'t you think? Ma: YOU ONLY CAME HERE TO GET THE OLD JAKE BACK!!! J- guys, that\\'s fine. We all need an education so listen to them, they know what\\'s best for us I guess. Ch- LOVES MADE YOU SOFT PAUL!! Alex then slapped him on the back of the head and we all laughed, we all promised that we would be good from now on. We just didn\\'t know if Deji would start on Jake and if the fight was still happening. During homeroom everyone from the squad had introduced themselves and soon enough everyone, including Mrs Darbus, was staring at us because we actually behaved! Mrs D- I\\'ve actually got an assignment for you all! You all have to make some songs!!! And they will be played in a months time at the homecoming game! J- YES FINALLY THERE CAN BE MUSIC FROM THIS CENTURY!! I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US WHEN I SAY HALLELUJAH!!! We all laughed at his remark and it even made Mrs Darbus chuckle. Rik: JAKE WE MADE A PROMISE! J- I can\\'t get kicked out for that surely!! Mrs D: not that I know of but that was funny, anyway what was this promise you made. Mr. Paul? Ka- Team 10 all agreed to it! That\\'s why we stayed good, the majority of the lesson. J- basically our girlfriends threatened us by saying that if we get kicked out of the school then they will break up with us. Just as he said that Deji walked by and came into our classroom... Jake\\'s PoV: We all turned our attention to the door and there I saw Deji... De- well if it isn\\'t snaky Paul and Erika hoestell. Me and Erika were holding hands and she felt me tense up dramatically. Rik: what do you want wedgie? De- does Paul now need his slut to fight his battles for him? Rik: Jake don\\'t you dare! You\\'ve got a broken hand and that\\'s only gonna make it worse. I let go of her hand and stood up, Erika had hold of my waist and didn\\'t want me to fight him, I even had team 10 keeping me away from him. De- THIS IS PRICELESS! YOU ALL ARE PROTECTING THAT SLUT WHEN SHE EXCHANGES FROM MAN TO MAN! ERIKA IF YOU WANT A REAL MAN I HAVE A BED READY FOR YOU!!! And with that I walked straight up to Deji\\'s face, looked straight into his eyes and within moments he was on the floor holding the side of his head. I crouched down to him and whispered something that I only wanted him to hear, whispered* J- don\\'t fucking test me! I could do a lot worse but I\\'m not as I feel as if I\\'ve made myself pretty clear! You probably would have done a lot worse to me if we were on about your gf but I didn\\'t wanna put you in the hospital but next time you say anything like this shit about my girlfriend I\\'ll instantly put you in the hospital, *grabs his collar and yanks him closer to him* you better start digging your grave by the end of the month if you say any of this shit about Erika again! *said this part loudly* DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?! De- Yes... J-Jake Paul! And he ran off, I didn\\'t care about the consequences but as soon as I stood back up Erika came running into my arms. She held on tight and we stayed like that until the Principal came to investigate what happened. (PM= Principal Matsui) PM- What happened in Mrs Darbus\\' classroom Jake? I shrugged my shoulders and stayed quiet, I needed Erika to help me calm down. PM- Jake?... Each word he said sounded as if it was an echo and I couldn\\'t understand it. PM- Jake, we need to know this stuff, please tell me and I promise that it\\'ll stay between us! J- Deji called my girlfriend a slut, prostitute, fuckgirl, sket, slag, a hoe and said that I would have to fuck her like a prostitute if you know what I mean. That\\'s exactly what he called her, happy now? PM- easy Jake, I need to know this stuff. Anyway we are going to put you in seclusion for the rest of the day and that\\'s as far as we\\'ll go okay? I nodded and he let me go, he explained it more saying that I would have seclusion after break. I went back inside the classroom and sat in my seat, Mrs Darbus had to speak to me but it was to only find out what happened and if I was okay emotionally and all that. Erika had been taken out because she was summoned by the principal or whatever, most likely to give a statement on what happened. It was soon second lesson and we walked to Gym! Finally a class where I can relax! C.B- okay, we are going to have a push-up competition, the highest anyone in the school has gotten is 250 and let\\'s see if we can beat it! We all got ready and got paired up, it went in couples, that were in the room at the time were together, Made (Mackenzie and Kade), Tanthony (Tessa and Anthony), Nelly (Nathan and Kelly), Chalex (Chance and Alex), Troyella (Gabriella and Troy), Chaylor (Chad and Taylor), Zarpay (Zeke and Sharpay), Relsi (Ryan and Kelsi), Jartha (Jason and Martha) and eventually Erika showed up so then Jerika (Jake and Erika). We all started then stopped when the buzzer went off. We counted all of the boys first: •Kade: 280 •Anthony: 490 •Nathan: 280 •Chance: 490 •Troy: 500 •Chad: 500 •Zeke: 500 •Ryan: 500 •Jason: 500 •Jake: 1212 Ch- Jake? That\\'s the least amount of pushups you\\'ve ever done, what\\'s up? J- did you seriously forget what happened in homeroom?! Rik: can I get your guys opinions on this? *lifts Jakes bruised hand up* does this look broken to you? Everyone except Jake and Erika: Yah! Rik: TOLD YOU IT WAS BROKEN! J- It doesn\\'t even hurt, I literally can\\'t feel anything! C.B- go get it checked out Jake, you may not want to but we have to! It\\'s for your safety! J- fine, whatever... Rik: JAKE! Respect him. J- sorry coach. C.B- it\\'s fine, I\\'ve raised a teen I understand the moodiness. T- I hate you at times We all laughed and continued to talk about the games when suddenly Coach said something I didn\\'t want to be true. C.B- our next matches for football, soccer and basketball are in Cleveland Ohio... Me, Chance and Tony instantly paled... we can\\'t go back there! They don\\'t understand why we left and never properly will even if we explain it to them! Ja- Wait, Jake. Aren\\'t you from Cleveland Ohio? J- yep... Chanthony- same with us! Terika- and us! Made- and us Kalex- with us as well. N- and me! Rik: what school are we playing against? C.B- Westlake High, why? J- that was our old school... Everyone was shocked but then me and Chance said this: J- when\\'s the game and all that? Ch- yeah because if we get there a couple days before the game we can show you around! mumbled* J- and I can see my dad without my mom knowing... C.B- we are going there a week before the actual games and we are going to do some classes there as well. Now when we get there we have to meet with this teacher called \"Mrs Clark\" I tensed, Erika felt it, I can\\'t believe that I have to go through the torture of playing against them! They will kill me! I never mentioned this to no one, not even Chance, Tony, Emilio, Kade, Nathan or Chad, the only real reason I left was because that school was the worst place for bullying alive. I should know as I was the main victim! Coach handed us the letters and we all left, I went straight to seclusion and chilled for a bit, I decided to text my mentor if I can talk to them. Start of Chat Mentor: what\\'s up Jake! Saw you walking to seclusion, what did you do this time? Jake Paul: can we please talk, I feel like the world around me is on fire and I just don\\'t feel comfortable! Mentor: of course, I\\'ll be right there! Which teacher should I ask? Jake Paul: Mr Reed. Mentor: okay I\\'m now leaving, I\\'ll be there soon! End of chat I finished talking to my mentor and he came and collected me from Seclusion and brought the work I was supposed to do with me. (Chris= Mentor) Chris- what\\'s up then Pizzy Paul?! J- I\\'m stressed! I have to go back to Cleveland for matches and no one knows why I really left! Like I feel scared on what\\'s gonna happen! Chris- Jake, take a breather and relax. You\\'re showing signs of anxiety but it can go away, you just need to relax. J- also as soon as I\\'ve finished with my matches I have to go to a show which I\\'m in and perform with Team 10! Chris- and aren\\'t your rehearsals after school? J- yep... Chris- Jake, how did you end up in seclusion this time? I shrugged my shoulders and looked down, Chris was the only person in this entire school, minus team 10, who understood what I do and why I do it. Chris- Jake, please tell me. You know you can trust me... J- Me and Deji got into a fight, well more like I punched him and that was it. Chris- what made you do that? J- he kept on calling my girlfriend a slut, a prostitute, slag, sket, fuckgirl and a hoe. Chris looked at me sympathetically and then had an idea. Chris- instead of being in seclusion how about I talk to Mr Matsui about letting you be in here whilst you\\'re meant to be in seclusion but you can see all your friends at lunch and get out on time yeah? J- that would be awesome! Thanks! Chris managed to convince them to let me stay with him and I can\\'t believe that it actually worked. It was lunch and I met the gang in the usual spot. Erika saw me and same running straight at me. Rik: I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN SECLUSION! J- Chris managed to get me out so now I\\'m chilling in his room and I get to go home at normal time! Rik: WE NEED A SLEEPOVER, YOU ALL DOWN AT MY PLACE?! Te- we\\'ve been inside there is nowhere as much room for all of us. J- how about at my place? Ch- what about David and your mom? J- won\\'t be there, visiting Logan for the week. Rik: who\\'s David? J- my step dad... I looked down at my shoes but then felt this force lift my chin up, it was Erika. She looked me in my eyes and smiled and I smiled back. Rik: Jake there is another reason why you can\\'t get kicked out... J- what? Rik: your dad thinks that he\\'s a failure of a parent and told me that if you get kicked out then he will actually kill himself...'][Chapter 7] ['(A/N: I am adding the tryouts now because I decided to add them and it all links up later so don\\'t be confused.) Jake\\'s PoV: Me, Chance and Tony were all practicing our skills for football before tryouts to get warmed up. Suddenly Troy and Chad walk over to us aggressively, we looked at them and they had a lot of attitude towards me mainly but some to Chance and Tony. T- dude, when you first got here you were such a nice, relaxed person but now you\\'re acting like this jerk! What gives? J- I told you! I gave you all a warning saying that I could go back! You just never believed that I would! T- DUDE, YOU\\'RE BULLYING PEOPLE INTO DEPRESSION!! J- Name someone then!... T- KELSI NIELSEN, ALISSA VIOLET, DEJI AND JJ! J- I don\\'t fucking care! C- DUDE, YOU SHOULD CARE! Suddenly Alissa came over looking pissed, Ali: LEAVE THEM THE FUCK ALONE! C- why do you care? Ali: BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE BROTHERS TO ME SO FUCK OFF! T- yet they bullied you into depression... Ali: I don\\'t care! You don\\'t know what\\'s going on in their lives! C- and you do? Ali: yes I do! C- anyway, let\\'s stop wasting our time on people who break people down and make them feel like shit! And with that they walked away and Alissa hugged me, I hugged back and apologised for what we were doing. J- sorry for everything we\\'ve done to you Alissa. Ali: it\\'s fine, I know you can\\'t control what happens and what goes on at home. We all smiled and suddenly someone was clicking their fingers in my face. (A/N: this is were it comes back after Jake finds out what his dad said.) I snapped back to reality when everyone was talking to me, we were sat on the bleachers and looked at the field, I was remembering what happened when me and Troy had our first argument. Rik: what were you thinking about? J- my first argument with Troy and when me and Alissa made up. I sighed, I still couldn\\'t get over what my dad said. Erika then started to sing softly: There was a time, when I used to look into my fathers eyes. In a happy home, I was a king, I had a golden throne. But those days are gone, and now the memory\\'s on the wall. I hear the songs, from the places I was born. Upon a hill across a blue lake, that\\'s where I had my first heartbreak. I still remember how it all changed. My father said, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry child, see heavens got a plan for you. Don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry now. Yeeeaaah, there was a time. I met a guy of a different kind, we ruled the world. I thought I\\'d never lose him out of sight, we were so young. I think of him now and then, I still hear the songs. Reminding me of a friend, upon a hill across a blue lake. That\\'s where I had my first heartbreak, I still remember how it all changed. My father said, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry child, see heavens got a plan for you, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry now. Yeeeaaah, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry child, see heavens got a plan for you, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry now. Yeeeaaah, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry child, see heavens got a plan for you, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry now, yeeeaaah, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry child, see heavens got a plan for you, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry now, yeeeaaah. Don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry child see heavens for a plan for you, don\\'t you worry, don\\'t you worry now, yeeeaaah. By the last couple lines of the song everyone had joined in and I had tears in my eyes. Tony wrapped his arm around me and pulled me close to him, he managed to put his chin on the top of my head whilst I placed my head in the crook of his neck, I didn\\'t cry we just stayed like that for awhile. I didn\\'t want to stay in school, I didn\\'t want to stay here knowing that my dad could kill himself in any second but I had to stay in school and not get kicked out. It was so confusing that we all started wandering around and we didn\\'t go to lesson, instead we stopped by my mentor\\'s and he let them stay with me considering what we just told him. Chris had left to go explain to all of their teachers what was up because we all had maths, I decided that I wanted to invite Alissa, Troy and his lot round as well. I mean we had the space. J- can you guys invite Troy and his friends round for a sleepover tonight, say I wanna apologise for everything I\\'ve ever done to him and his friends as I\\'m gonna explain to him everything. Chanthony- sure! J- thanks. time skip* Troy and his gang accepted the invite and soon enough we were all chilling at mine for a sleepover. We were all outside sitting by the pool when I needed to clear the tension in the air. J- guys, I\\'m sorry for all the shit I\\'ve done. It wasn\\'t cool of me and I get if you don\\'t wanna be friends but I wanna get rid of the tension. T- dude, we just wanna know what started it. J- my mom and step dad started arguing and the anger and like the attitude appeared, I guess. Ch- and then we all started acting like dicks to make it seem as if like we turned him back and make it less suspicious I guess. T- what\\'s it gonna be like when we go to Ohio for the game? Jcha- awkward Rik: Jake, you need to tell them! You can\\'t keep hiding it! Chanthony- do we know it? J- nope, Erika wasn\\'t even supposed to know. Everyone except Jake and Erika- you can tell us if you want. J- Westlake High was one of the biggest places for bullying. Rik: yeah, the \"golden boys\" turned into them! Ka- do you know why though? J- wait you know? Ka- I saw it and that\\'s how the golden boys were made! Chanthony- ohhhhhh! That thing! Kade told us! J- MOVING ON! Like I said it was the biggest place for bullying, and well before I was a bad boy I was the main victim! C- that\\'s messed up! J- then we made the golden boys and acted all like that so then it would stop! Rik: I mean ever since we all left my sister told me that it\\'s gotten worse! J- of course it has! S: ummm excuse me cheekbones but who are you!? Rik: Sorry, I\\'m Erika Costell, I\\'m Jakes girlfriend! S: YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND!! J- MAYBE IF YOU ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME THEN I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU! We all laughed and continued to talk, me and the gang now formed a massive group and it was awesome. We made really good friendships and I felt really happy! D- JAKE JOSEPH PAUL GET YOUR LOUSY ASS IN HERE!! J- holy shit! WHATS HE DOING HERE?! D- DONT MAKE ME HUNT YOU DOWN! J- IVE GOT MY FRIENDS OVER! ALSO DONT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! WHAT GIVES YOU THE FUCKING RIGHT TO?! D- THE FACT THAT IM YOUR DAD!! NOW GET YOUR ASS IN HERE THEN AFTER A BIT YOU CAN GO BACK AND SEE YOUR FRIENDS! J- YOU\\'RE NOT MY FUCKING DAD YOU ASS HOLE! I NEVER WANTED YOU IN MY LIFE AND NEVER WILL! I told everyone I\\'d be right back and I went to go see what he wanted. J- what the fuck do you want?! D- Don\\'t talk to me in that tone! J- don\\'t act as if you\\'re my fucking dad then! D- school called, you fucking punched DEJI! J- I don\\'t have time for this shit! I\\'m going to go be with my friends and anyway, what are you doing here? D- me and your mother are going our separate ways. We aren\\'t getting a divorce she just wants the old house in place in case you ever move back. J- okay, can I go now? Before I could leave he grabbed onto my wrist tightly and whispered in my ear \"You won you little fucking waste of space! I\\'ll be back though, and I will hunt you down and it won\\'t be pretty!\" He let go and I looked at my wrist, great it\\'s fucking bruising! I sighed and walked out the door to see everyone in the pool. I sat on the edge of the pool and leaned back, I closed my eyes and relaxed. I was too pissed to do stuff. Erika swam over to me and got up onto the side. Rik: Jake, what happened? J- ... Rik: Jake? By this time everyone was looking at us but I didn\\'t care, my own step dad said I was a waste of space and that just brought back the memories from when my actual parents were arguing. I opened my eyes and sat up, I put the hand that he grabbed down and immediately retracted it. Erika stared at me and realised that it was the hand that was supposedly broken. Rik: Jake, we are going to go get your hand checked out! Earlier you said you couldn\\'t feel anything! J- BECAUSE I COULDN\\'T BUT ITS NOT MY HAND THAT HURTS! Rik: THEN WHAT HAPPENED JAKE?! J- MY STEP DAD! Rik: are you being serious? J- Nah I said it for the fucking fun of it! I didn\\'t realise that we were shouting and soon enough everyone came swimming over. Chanthony- dude, tell them how long it\\'s been going on for. J- you know on my first day at east high? T- OH YEAH WE WERE THERE! C- he continued doing it?! J- ever since Logan left for college he started being a bit more aggressive. I sighed and threw my head back, why did all of this have to start when my friends where there? David then came to the outside door and shouted, D- going up to Ohio, see ya Jakers! I death stared him and he growled and left. As soon as he left I was in the best of moods! We all relaxed downstairs and the girls forced us to watch Camp Rock 2: the final jam, High school musical 2 and then Pitch Perfect 3. By the end of all the movies the guys were all about done with singing but ERIKA made us do karaoke! It was actually really funny to do karaoke with Erika, Tessa picked out our song and it was Wouldn\\'t Change a thing from Camp Rock 2, Erika: Its like he doesn\\'t hear a word I say His mind is somewhere far away And I don\\'t know how to get there It\\'s like all he wants to do is chill out Jake: she\\'s way too serious, she\\'s always in a rush He makes me wanna pull all my hair Out Jake: and interrupting Like he doesn\\'t even care Jake: like she doesn\\'t even care You Jake: me We\\'re face to face Both: But we don\\'t see eye to eye Erika: Like fire and rain Jake: Like fire and rain You can drive me insane Jake: you can drive me insane Both: But I can\\'t stay mad at you for Anything Erika: We\\'re Venus and Mars Jake: we\\'re Venus and mars We\\'re like different stars Jake: we\\'re like different stars Both: But you\\'re the harmony to every Song I sing and I wouldn\\'t change a Thing Jake: She\\'s always trying to save the day Just wanna let my music play She\\'s all or nothing But my feelings never change I try to read her mind, she tries to pick A fight Erika: why does he try to read my mind?, it\\'s not good to psychoanalyse To get attention, that\\'s what all of my friends say Erika: that\\'s what all of my friends say Erika: You Jake: me Both: We\\'re face to face but we don\\'t see eye to eye Erika: Like fire and rain Jake: like fire and rain You can drive me insane Jake: you can drive me insane Both: But I can\\'t stay mad at you for anything Erika: We\\'re Venus and mars Jake: we\\'re Venus and mars We\\'re like different stars Jake: like different stars Both: But you\\'re the harmony to every song I sing and I wouldn\\'t change a thing Jake: When I\\'m yes she\\'s no Erika: when I hold on he just let\\'s go Both: We\\'re perfectly imperfect But I wouldn\\'t change a thing, no Erika: Like fire and rain Jake: like fire and rain You can drive me insane Jake: you can drive me insane Both: But I can\\'t stay mad at you for anything Erika: We\\'re Venus and mars Jake: we\\'re Venus and mars We\\'re like different stars Jake: like different stars Both: But you\\'re the harmony to every song I sing and I wouldn\\'t change a thing But I can\\'t stay mad at you for anything Erika: We\\'re Venus and mars Jake: we\\'re Venus and mars We\\'re like different stars Jake: like different stars Both: But you\\'re the harmony to every song I sing and I wouldn\\'t change a, wouldn\\'t change a thing Everyone started clapping and we were born laughing so much, somehow Troy managed to convince me Chance and Tony to sing: Ohio Fried Chicken: Jake: Honkey Dong Tonkey tong Ohio Fried Chicken is what it\\'s called I got my truck, my overalls. Just me and my boys making fried Chicken y\\'all Tony: Kentucky can\\'t compete, No, OFC, sweep you off your feet. Please look up to me, we\\'ll tell you what to do, tenders the move. Hey, ya, get yourself some sauce, yeah you a boss. Chance: OFC that\\'s how we\\'re livin\\'. Come around town you\\'ll find me sittin\\', you\\'re a pretty girl with no care. No problem in the world not even her hair colour, I think I found what I finally need. Chicken and a girl that\\'s nice and thicken\\' slow it down or speed it up I\\'m making my way to Ohio Fried Chicken bitch. Jake: Honkey Dong Tonkey Tong Ohio Fried Chicken is what it\\'s called I got my truck, my overalls just me and my boys makin\\' Fried Chicken y\\'all They said I wouldn\\'t make it now my chickens naked And my truck is lifted Shout out to ma n\\' pops I got my piggy I got my goat But I still need a little boat I wanna make my family proud I just wanna sell out a crowd I need a girl who\\'s down to ride Workin\\' all day that\\'s, that Ohio pride Just me and my boys makin\\' Fried Chicken y\\'all We finished singing for the night but then we needed to do our assignments for Mrs Darbus: Ch- yo, we should make so many songs for the homecoming game! J- isn\\'t homecoming in Ohio? T- I think so J- well, I think me, Tony and Sunny, as we had the most trouble with the teachers there, make a teachers diss track and ask to perform it! (A/N: I forgot to add Sunny earlier on, sorry about that. So now sunny is in it️) Rik: work on that tomorrow, I mean after all it is the weekend! T- crap, I forgot it was! J- wanna meet up at like a park tomorrow and like play basketball or football or soccer? Everyone except Jake- sure! We all fell asleep smiling and having our best friends with us!'][Chapter 8] [\"Logan's PoV: I couldn't believe that Jake was getting 'abused' by our step dad. I felt so bad, the only reason I fount out was because Chad D had texted me explaining what had been happening. I had just gotten to Albuquerque's airport and was waiting for Erika to come pick me up, after about 20 minutes she arrived with Troy and his friends. We all got reacquainted and left for Jake's. They all snuck me in and I saw Jake outside playing basketball with Tony, I had been informed that later that day we were all going to the park and we're gonna play football and soccer etc. I walked outside and surprised Jake. We finally left at 2:30pm and arrived at the park in 10 minutes. The time we were there went like this: •Chad D, Troy, Zeke, Jason and Tony - basketball •Me, Jake, Nathan and Ryan - football •Emilio, Kade, Ivan and Chance - soccer. All the girls were cheerleaders and were practicing their routines, I caught Jake looking at Erika way too often and had to ask if he was good for him to come back to realisation. De- Sssssss, snaky paul! Sssssssss... J- fuck off Deji! I'm guessing Erika heard and saw what was happening as she instantly ran to Jakes side and held him back, everyone else just stared at them. L- wedgie, fuck off. Or do I have to let Jake kill you? Cuz he will! De- yeah because that's gonna scare me, anyway JJ sent me, he challenged you to a boxing match *points at me* and then I wanna challenge Snaky Paul to a match as well! LJ- you're on! Everyone cheered for us and then Deji walked away, I looked at Jake and he smiled. I can believe that we get to fix Deji and JJ's faces for free!! L- once we find out the date, that day will be the rise of the Pauls! J- I haven't heard that in ages! L- bro, let's show these English... what's that word that the English people like to use a lot? J- wanker?... twat... bastard...? L- all of those actually! I saw Jake chuckle and we continued with our day, it was really good until Jake asked me this. J- Logie? L- what's up Jakers? J- mom and David said that they were spending the week with you but you're here. So where are they? L- didn't David tell you that he's gone down to Ohio? J- yep, that's all I know... L- that's all I know as well, Mom never said anything to me about coming to see me and she knew I was gonna surprise you! J- you don't think her and David went down to Ohio to see someone... L- if that's true then Dad might need protecting because who else would they go see?... Suddenly I heard a phone go off, it wasn't mine. It was Jakes, he looks at the text then immediately puts his phone away and acts as if he never got the message. I walk over to him and ask what the text said: L- Jake, what did the message say? J-... L- Jakey? J-... I stared at him and he looked down at the ground, apparently he didn't want me knowing so that's just great! L- Jake, was that dad?... He shrugged his shoulders, why is he avoiding talking to me?! Something went off in my brain and all I knew was that it got me pissed... L- Jake! Talk to me lil bro! J- DROP IT LOGAN! L- NOT UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME NORMALLY! J- IM NOT GONNA TELL YOU WHAT THE TEXT FUCKING SAID! GET THAT IN YOUR BRAIN! L- WHY NOT?! J- IT DOESNT FUCKING CONCERN YOU! NOTHING THAT IS GOING ON IN MY LIFE CONCERNS YOU RIGHT NOW OKAY?! L- I WANNA BE THERE FOR YOU BUT I CANT IF YOU KEEP ME IN THE DARK! J- YOURE JUST AS BAD AS DAVID! HE SAID THAT EXACT THING THE DAY YOU LEFT AND MY LIFE BECAME A LIVING NIGHTMARE! L- that was David wasn't it?! JAKE WHAT DID HE SAY?! J- SO WHAT, IT WAS DAVID ALRIGHT! IM SICK OF BEING CONSTANTLY TREATED LIKE SHIT EVER SINCE MOM AND HIM STARTED ARGUING! GUESS WHAT? OUR NAMES KEEP ON GETTING MENTIONED! WHO DOES THAT REMIND YOU OF?! L- Jake... that reminds me of mom and dad when they were arguing! J- AT LEAST YOU DONT HAVE TO LIVE HEARING ALL THE SCREAMING! BECAUSE NEWS FLASH THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IVE HAD TO HEAR MOM YELL AT SOMEONE FOR THE MOST PETTY THING! YOU WERENT THERE FOR THE ACTUAL FIGHTS BETWEEN MOM AND DAD WELL IVE HEARD EVERYTHING SINCE WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED! And with that Jake walked away and didn't stop when Erika shouted his name, he made me feel like the worse brother ever. I didn't know that he had to go through all of this by himself! If I had known that he was listening and was staying at the house during the fights then I would have been there with him but I was always out with girls. Everyone looked over at me and all I said was: L- im the worse brother ever... Erika pulled me into a hug and soon enough everyone joined in and we all went to go find Jake. I never knew how much the fighting affected him, I wish I did. Jake's PoV: Ughhhhh, I blew up at my brother over a stupid message. I didn't wanna tell him the threats that David said because they quite frankly scare me, he was right. It was David but with a threat... The message: David- I had an idea and it will get messy, you tell your friends about any of this and well you will be the one in the hospital clinging onto dear life and when you're in there I'll make sure you never come out!... ️CONTENT WARNING: CUTTING SOON️ I understood completely where Logan was coming from just that I wish he was here when all the fighting was happening. When I walked away I kept on thinking this and knew that I was about to do something stupid. I can't do this anymore, I don't want to be here anymore! It was the honest truth on how I felt, everyone wanted me to say how I was feeling well there you are! The truth, I Jake Paul wanted to commit suicide! I walked straight from the park to my house and grabbed something sharp, the first thing I saw was a knife and maybe that's what I needed as Logan and Erika had binned my razors. I ran straight to mine and Logan's room, locked the door then went into the bathroom and locked the door. ️cutting now: here's the warning️ I grabbed the knife and brought it up to my wrist, I applied pressure and this red liquid came out. I smiled contently as I had drew blood. I continued cutting my arm until I realised that everyone would see, I then pulled my shorts down and pulled the elastic part of my boxers away from my skin and cut. It felt so good to finally be relieved of all the stress, I didn't care if they saw because I felt weightless! I heard these bangs on mine and Logan's door, it startled me but luckily I wasn't cutting, I heard that same voice that broke my heart. ️no more cutting️ Rik: Jakeyy?... I quickly cleaned up the knife, my wrist and legs then went and sat on my bed, I completely forgot that I was wearing a short sleeve top until Erika and Logan came barging into our room. Their eyes immediately locked with my arm and they were frozen. Logan walked in whilst he told Erika to go downstairs and get Chance and Anthony, Logan sat on my bed and looked heartbroken. L- jaker? J- ... L- Jake, I'm sorry that you had to deal with this all by yourself... J- ... L- I wish I could have prevented this J- ... it's not your fault *whispered* L- it is though, I should have been there for you! Helped you with this, instead I was hooking up with Alissa and making you wanna kill yourself! J- which I actually attempted... L- I'm the worse brother ever! I broke the pact we made! I broke the brother code! J- there's a brother code and I didn't know about it?! We both laughed and that brought a smile to Logan's face: L- yeah, there's a piece of paper with it on! J- good thing I never got it then! I wouldn't read shit! We both laughed again and I sat up, Logan brought me close to him and we hugged. L- dude, Cleveland's playing tonight in the NBA. Put your jersey and a hoodie on! J- I don't care if they see the cuts, it's something that I can explain to them! I then got up and went to go get my Cleveland jersey, Logan did the same. We both walked downstairs to see Chance, Tony and Mr Trujillo. B- Jake... J- you here to tell me off for the cuts because well I still do it! Chanthony- you lied to us?... J- I couldn't bring myself to tell you guys that I still was! I'm sorry... Ch- it's okay, we just wanna help! B- Jake, who are you staying with? J- no one, well now Logan. Our Mom went fuck knows where and David is down in Ohio... A- you don't know where your mom went? LJ- nope! Ch- wait, she told us that she was going to go see you for the week Logan! L- she never said that to me! I didn't even know that Mom talked about me! J- great! That makes our idea even more true! Everyone except Jake and Logan- what idea? LJ- that she went down to Ohio with David to see our dad... A- Jake, you need to tell Logan what your dad said... L- what?... J- dad said that if I get kicked out of East High he's gonna kill himself... B- why would he say that?!... J- apparently he's a failure of a father! L- Jake if you get kicked out of East High it won't be your fault okay, remember that! J- you all would be calling me a murderer if I got kicked out, that's true so don't even deny it! Chanthony- we wouldn't! J- I know that! L- Um, the match is starting soon between the Cavs and the 76ixers. Wanna see who can come round to watch it with us? J- invite George, Erika, and the gang we have! L- including everyone from today? J- yep! Team10 Chat: LoganPool: who wants to come over and watch the Cavs Vs 76ixers? Troy: I'm down! ChaddyD: Hands down I'm in! TrickyRik️: Is my lil Dino gonna be there? J Pizzy Paul: I live there TrickyRik️ Kelsi: okay, that'll be interesting! Zeke: me and Jas will be round! J Pizzy Paul: so is everyone gonna be there? Jason: yeah, we'll get the rest of the girls on board! LoganPool: y'all wanna stay the night as well? X- YES! J Pizzy Paul: Kk, we'll set it up! TessaBrooks️: we'll see you guys in 15? LoganPool: sounds good! End of chat... Me and Logan went around the house setting everything up, Mr Trujillo, Chance and Tony were gonna stay with us for awhile, A) because of me cutting and B) because we needed an adult. Exactly like Tessa said they all arrived 15 minutes after we were messaging them. They all walked in and were shocked as they looked at my arm, I nodded and I got use to all of them being gobsmacked about my arm. J- guys I know you all wanna ask why I did this, there is no explanation though I just did it. And hopefully you all won't judge me if I carried on doing it... X- we wouldn't judge we would just try and make you stop! I nodded and Logan decided to ask this: L- so after the match what do you wanna do? X except Jake and Logan- TRUTH OR DARE KARAOKE! JL- is that even a thing? Rik: it will be! I laughed and Erika snuggled up next to me and we watched the match, seeing as Jason and Zeke still had their 76ixers jerseys on we all started joking around saying the 76ixers are shit because they lost. It was time for Truth or Dare: Karaoke edition and I decided to film it on my dad's old camera. J- okay, so let me explain what's going on. We are all about to do... Rik: TRUTH OR DARE: KARAOKE EDITION!! J- so before we get into what that is let me introduce you all to each other! points at troy* he's mr Troy Bolton! T- wadup?!

Gabriella: I'm not a stranger to the dark Hide away, they say 'Cause we don't want your broken Parts I've learned to be ashamed of all my Scars Run away, they say No one will love you as you are But, I won't let them break me down To dust I know that there's a place for us For we are glorious!

J- Okay so I'm gonna end This here as well it's gonna get boring watching the same thing over and over again! So peace out!\"][Chapter 9] ['Logan\\'s PoV: Ever since Jake cut his arm really badly he hasn\\'t been able to stop. He no longer does it on his arms but he does it on his legs and ankles, sometimes I try and stop him but that makes him cut more. It\\'s been 3 weeks since he cut in the most visible spot and damn he got questioned at school, somehow only by the teachers and not the students. Jake was currently packing his bags because he and the soccer, football and basketball teams were all heading down to Cleveland for their homecoming games. I was on the edge of about letting him go but he needed to see our mom for a couple days, Coach Bolton told me that they were staying in a hotel but then I remembered that we have our dad\\'s house and our old house still available and in our parents names. The gang was all downstairs but then Chance, Tony, Zeke and Jason all went upstairs maybe they didn\\'t know where the bathroom was or something. I dunno. T- have you been trying to get him to stop? L- everyday, but then he cuts worse... T- I\\'m sorry you have to deal with this.. L- it\\'s fine, it ain\\'t your guys\\' faults because I wasn\\'t here for him and I broke the pact we made. Eventually Jake, Zeke, Jason and Chanthony all walked down the stairs and of course Jake and Chanthony were in their Cleveland Cavaliers Jerseys. I smiled as Jake threw mine at me and we all walked to school, I was coming with them because of Jake. Coach Bolton had spoke to me before hand that Jake may need someone to talk to and that his brother would be the best option. We all walked into the gym, once we arrived at school, and we saw everyone already there. Me, Chance, Tony and Jake had our jerseys on and they all knew that we were going to our hometown. JChA- OHIO! Everyone stared and laughed at them but it made Jake happy, we all got on the bus and left for the airport. The cheerleaders would be coming later today so we would still get to see them. During this 3 weeks, Me and Jake fount out where our mom was. She was indeed in Ohio in the old house so we were staying there, Jake was taken off of report, me and Chloe Bennett started dating and all in all life was actually fairly decent for once. Jakes PoV: We arrived in Cleveland at around 12:30pm and all got in a bus to the hotel, me and Logan were sitting in the back when Coach said, C.B- the cheerleaders forced us to have a bus with Karaoke... J- ERIKA! T- GABRIELLA! A- TESSA! Ch- ALEX! C- TAYLOR! Chad- SUNNY! E- why Karaoke? I- yeah? Why Karaoke? J- because our girlfriends like to make us look like idiots which I really don\\'t need help with! L- you do because you aren\\'t an idiot, you are a full on blonde choche! Everyone laughed and then I said, J- I never knew Donald Trump was on this bus? MARTINEZ TWINS RUN! HE COULD DEPORT YOU!! At this point even Coach Bolton was laughing and it was funny... L- well if I\\'m Donald Trump then you\\'re Ellen Degeneres! We all couldn\\'t stop laughing and then Chanthony said something incredibly stupid! Chanthony- JAKE I WONDER IF THEY HAVE ANY OF YOUR SONGS ON THERE! Everyone looked at me confused, I slapped them both on the back of their heads and then explained: J- because of how bad things were here for me I decided that like music helped like getting through it so I made a couple songs. Chad, Troy, Zeke and Jason have actually heard two... T- was one of them that Chitty Bang song then the other Ohio fried chicken? J- I had A LOT of spare time. A- DUDE, SING ONE OF THEM! J- Jesus Christ you two are savages... Ch- how about... THAT AINT ON THE NEWS! J- FINE!... Jake: Pressure hard They all watching now Make a mistake World on me now It ain\\'t easy just a Kid from a small town To every news publication Tryna take me down I\\'m human too They want me to lose Want me in a noose But they ain\\'t tell the truth Tryna drag my name Tryna stop my game Don\\'t know the pain Bitch I know the pain Where was y\\'all at when I was on email Tryna stop depressed fans from killin\\' themselves Where was y\\'all at when I was in the kitchen Whippin\\' up meals for kids on thanksgiving Where was y\\'all at when I was with the teacher Handing out backpacks and handing out t-shirts Or where was y\\'all at when make a wish hit me to meet my girl Caylee Damn that shit changed me That ain\\'t on the news That ain\\'t on the news You think you know me but That ain\\'t on the news That ain\\'t on your Twitter That ain\\'t on your insta That ain\\'t on your Twitter, man That ain\\'t on your insta I\\'m sorry for my actions man, I\\'m asking for forgiveness man I\\'m asking you to witness My growth in this business My growth as kid shit I know you can\\'t admit it You know that I kill it, You know my game pippin You know the views rippin You know that I\\'m a villain You know the bank chillin\\' You know that you can\\'t stop me Yeah I know that I\\'m cocky You know I\\'m tryna not be Like I said I\\'m sorry But I gotta ask man Where was y\\'all at when I was in the lunch room Stopping kids from getting bullied They were scared to come to school where was y\\'all at when I was 17 years old And living on my own, tryna find a way to grow Or where was y\\'all at when Selena left Disney Didn\\'t talk shit to her but now you talk Shit to me Where was y\\'all at when the neighbours didn\\'t hate me They all wanted pictures but now they tryna play me That ain\\'t on the news That ain\\'t on the news You think you know me But that ain\\'t on the news That ain\\'t on your Twitter That ain\\'t on your insta That ain\\'t on your Twitter, man That ain\\'t on your insta That ain\\'t on the news That ain\\'t on the news You think you know me But that ain\\'t on the news That ain\\'t on your Twitter That ain\\'t on your insta That ain\\'t on your twitter, man That ain\\'t on your insta I finished the song and everyone was shocked at the lyrics but then Chance had an idea... Ch- YOU AND LOGAN SHOULD SING! Logan nodded and I agreed... We decided to sing, Rise of the Paul\\'s: Logan: Let me just start off by saying, I think my brothers an idiot Jake: it\\'s true Logan: and he can be a real dick sometimes Jake: also true Logan: but he is my brother Jake: still true Logan: and I\\'m always gonna have his back... It\\'s... The... Rise of the Paul\\'s that\\'s right the brothers are back! Jake: we bout to make this shit look easy like a game, tic tac Logan: now eeny, meeny, miny, moe Both: pick a YouTuber and roast him slow Logan: all of their views be falling like snow Jake: and we just bought two lambos with the butterfly doors Logan: although, they so below Jake: it\\'s clear that all these other suckers plateaued Logan: we came in and grabbed youtube by the balls Jake: i know as a fact that it wasn\\'t ready for the Paul\\'s, at all Logan: Early 20\\'s and more talent then y\\'all Jake: and we ball... Logan: quit youtube, we still crush like a cannon ball Put Jakes name in your title and you can pay this months rent We know you\\'re calling your lawyers yeah that\\'s money well spent Cuz yeah, my brother messed up but he still got his Disney contract See me in person I guarantee you won\\'t make eye contact! Everybody parched Thirsty for the views but we be havin\\' some fun And these dude are like 30 and their names barely worthy to roll off our tongues Now I can\\'t tell the future Jake: but it\\'s a damn fact that we\\'ve just begun Logan: life is only moving faster Jake: me and logey \\'bout to hit mach 1 Both: the... grind... never... stops Only two ways to make it to the top Jake: one, be a leech. Gain your fame from the great ones Logan: two, be a maverick. Lead the pack like Napoleon Jake: I choose two, you can ride in my caravan Logan: got plenty of room in number one, for a lifespan! By the time we finished we had arrived at the hotel, everyone else put all their stuff in their rooms whilst me and Logan were waiting to take our stuff to our house. We chilled in Troy and Chads room before finding Chance, Tony, Zeke and Jason. They had put all of their stuff away and then decided to come with us and help set us up, we fount Coach Bolton and gave him the address and left. We arrived 20 minutes later and I took a deep breath, I hadn\\'t been there since last summer and Logan could tell I was nervous. L- bro, you good? J- ... L- Jake? J- huh? What?... L- you good?... J- yeah, yeah I\\'m fine L- I\\'m nervous too, you know?! J- why? I mean you weren\\'t here most of the time... L- jakers, I know that you and David haven\\'t got the best \\'relationship\\' but we\\'ve gotta do this for mom... I looked down and continued getting my bags out of the car, I heard Logan sign and knew that he wasn\\'t happy, most likely with me. As soon as we got our bags out of the boot we all walked inside and all the past memories I had came flooding back to me and I was considering walking straight back out the door but something kept me inside. Logan was busy talking to Troy and Chad so me, Chance, Anthony, Zeke and Jason took the bags upstairs. I walked into my old room and it was the exact same as I left it, I dropped my bags and looked around my room as the memories came back as if I did everything yesterday. I came across this picture, it was me, Logan, Mom and Dad when they were together. I started to tear up as I read the back of the frame, before long the tears were coming down my face and I couldn\\'t control it. After awhile I felt these arms wrap around my waist and they squeezed me tightly, I leaned my head back and let the tears fall. I didn\\'t know who was behind me until I heard my nickname... Rik: Dino?... J- sorry, it\\'s nothing... Rik: Jakey, it obviously is... you\\'ve been crying awhile that\\'s why I\\'m here! Logan called as soon as I landed and told me to come to the old house and go into your room... J- he\\'s the best at times... I turned around and me hugged properly, I felt her grab onto me a bit tight and knew that she was just showing she cared. Rik: Jake? J- y-yeah?... Rik: how did this start?... J- me crying for probably awhile?... Rik: yep, but also how did the fighting start?... J- ... Rik: jake... J- uhhhhh, me and Logan were joking around and then we both asked because we were also curious \"is the bed we were conceived on in this house?\" They both said no and then went on to say that it wasn\\'t even a bed and then one thing led to another my mom started getting pissed with my dad... Rik: Jakey... that\\'s awful... J- that\\'s also when the cutting started, I was convinced that it was my fault and school wasn\\'t making it any better. Rik: and the crying?... J- I was looking at a photo of me, Mom, Logan and Dad and it reminded me of when they were together and like I dunno... Erika just pulled me toward her and she held me, I couldn\\'t believe that she was so understanding. Just then David came barging in the house, by now everyone from the basketball, football and soccer teams had arrived. D- why the fuck are there like 50 people in my house? I then stormed out of my room and walked downstairs to face him myself J- THIS ISNT YOUR FUCKING HOUSE! AND WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO CLAIM IT?! D- PIPE DOWN! HOW WOULD YOU KNOW ANYWAY?! J- BECAUSE I ACTUALLY RESPECT AND ANYWAY WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT? D- THE FACT THAT IM YOUR FATHER! J- YOU ARENT MY FATHER! YOU ARE MY STUPID STEP FATHER WHO THINKS HE CAN WALTZ RIGHT INTO MY LIFE AND TREAT ME LIKE SHIT! MY DAD LIVES AROUND HERE SO MAYBE ILL GO STAY WITH HIM! I WANTED TO BE CIVIL WITH YOU BUT THEN THIS HAPPENED! D- GOOD RIDDANCE! And with that he shoulder barged me and walked straight into the backyard, I felt like shit and the fact that everyone had to witness it made it 10 times worse. I then turned around and they all stared at me and i shrugged my shoulders. Erika then came running at me and hugged me, soon enough Chanthony, Makade, Nelly, Troyella, Chaylor, etc joined. I then said that I needed some air and walked out the front and walked to my dad\\'s, I needed him! I knocked on the front door and he answered... Gr- jake... J- dad... And then I suddenly just broke down into tears, I needed him and he was there in front of me. He pulled me close to him and we hugged for ages. He walked me into his house and sat me down on his couch, he then sat next to me and put his arm around my shoulders and brought me even closer to him. Gr- jake?... J- ... Gr- jaker?... J- ... Gr- please talk to me... J- I-I... Gr- tell me what\\'s wrong please! I hate seeing you like this!!... J- I-I... I looked down, I was so ashamed of this. I wanted to give up, I couldn\\'t deal with everything. I considered showing him the cuts but I did because he\\'s my father and had a right to know, I pulled out of his embrace and stood up. He stared at me but once I showed him the cuts he pulled me into a hug just showed that he cared. Gr- Jaker? Why would you do this? J- because I\\'m done with my fucking life dad! I can\\'t live with the world always being a bitch to me! I CANT LIVE KNOWING THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE GONNA KILL YOURSELF IF I GOT KICKED OUT! Gr- Jake... I walked away from him and sat on the stairs, suddenly I heard this small noise walking down the stairs. I turned around and opened my eyes wide...'][Chapter 10] ['Lillie\\'s PoV: I heard this shouting so I came downstairs and saw someone looking upset, they must have heard me so they turned around and their eyes widened. I heard him say \"Dad\" which was odd as he was my dad. Li: daddy? What\\'s going on? ???- DADDY?! I HAVE A LITTLE SISTER?! Gr- JAKE NOWS NOT THE TIME! Li: is this my broder? Gr- Lillie, meet Jake. Your older brother... I approached Jake, I could tell that he was shocked. Suddenly he kneeled down and looked at me closely... J- h-hey?... Li: hi... J- I\\'m Jake, how old are you Lillie? Li: im 3... J- I\\'m sorry our shouting annoyed you, we didn\\'t realise that we were being that loud... Li: it okay, Dake... My dad chuckled and Jake smiled, I then hugged Jake and he hugged back... J- dad? Did you have Lillie with mom?... Gr- it\\'s complicated, bring Lillie into the room and then I\\'ll explain it to you both... Jake then picked me up and carried me to the room where I sat on his lap and snuggled into him, he looked down and smiled. J- please explain dad... Gr- yes, Lillie is your mothers. That\\'s the main reason we were arguing... Apparently when Pam first got pregnant with Lillie I had decided to leave her when you know that part and then yeah... your mom then left for that year and that was when she had Lillie... J- so that\\'s why her and David came to Ohio and left me and Logan there... Gr- bingo, anyway what are you doing here? J- the basketball, football and soccer teams have our homecoming here for some strange reason... Li: what home coming dake? J- something that I will explain later, K? Li: Kay... Jakes PoV: I couldn\\'t believe my eyes, there was this little girl in my dad\\'s house! I stood up and then screamed at my dad... J- DAD WHO IS THIS? Gr- JAKE NOWS NOT THE TIME! ???: is this my broder? Gr- Lillie, meet Jake, your older brother... She then came closer towards me and I was in shock, my dad had a fucking secret kid and didn\\'t tell us! Once she reached me I crouched down and admired her, she had the majority of my moms features but had my dad\\'s personality. She got startled when I crouched down but I reassured her that I wouldn\\'t hurt her. J- h-hey?... Li: hi... J- I\\'m Jake, how old are you Lillie? Li: im 3... J- I\\'m sorry our shouting annoyed you, we didn\\'t realise that we were being that loud... Li: it okay, Dake. Me and Dad chuckled then I smiled at her, I couldn\\'t believe that she was my little sister! I then asked Dad if she was moms and he told me to take Lillie into the room and so I did, when I sat down she snuggled into my chest. I looked down and smiled, she looked like an exact replica of me! My dad then explained everything and then Lillie started getting very fidgety... Li: I WANNA PWAY! J- Lil, want me to play with you? Li: PWETTY PWEASE! I heard Dad laugh so then I picked her up, put her on the floor and she went running off. Something felt weird when I stood up, my world was spinning and I was in A LOT of pain from where my cuts were, suddenly it went black... Greg\\'s PoV: Jake and Lillie were about to go play when Jake collapsed, I ran over to him and tried waking him up. Lillie looked mortified but I reassured her that she didn\\'t do anything wrong, I picked him up and put him on the couch. Jake then started clutching where he had his cuts, he was wincing and most likely passed out because of the pain. Gr- LILLIE, GO GET AUNTIE JO! And with that she sprinted up the stairs then suddenly Jo came running down the stairs with Lillie slowly following. Jo: Jake? Can you hear me? He slowly nodded his head and then Jo smiled a little bit. Jo- Jake? What happened? Gr- he has been cutting himself and then collapsed, he was clutching where his cuts were as I had just seen them. Jo nodded and grabbed some cold water, Lillie was in tears so I called her over and promised that she didn\\'t do anything wrong. It took 5 minutes for Jakes eyes to flutter open, he couldn\\'t keep them open but he was no longer in pain and remembered what had happened. Jo: Jake? What\\'s been going on at home? J- mom and my step dad, David, had started arguing and he started like grabbing me and hurting me... *whispered* Jake opened his eyes and not only did I finally get a good look at his appearance. His eyes had bags underneath them and they were all red and puffy, his arms and hands were all covered in bruises, his right eye had a small cut underneath it and Jake looked completely pale. Me and Jo both sighed and then we helped him sit up, Jake leant against me and I held him until his world stopped spinning. Lillie then came up to him and hugged him, she was in tears but Jake made sure she didn\\'t feel as if it was her fault. J- Lil, it isn\\'t your fault okay? Sorry if I made you scared I didn\\'t mean to... She smiled at him and he smiled back, I loved the way that they interacted with one another. Jo: Jake, you didn\\'t pass out because of your cuts. You passed out from anxiety and stress, we know that you\\'re scared to go back to WestLake for a bit and then you were stressed with the matches and the performance after the matches. Jake nodded and took a deep breath, I rubbed his back and I missed this. I missed having my boys in my life! J- dad? Gr- yeah? J- you and Lillie should come over later, I know that you won\\'t wanna but I feel like Logan should get to see you and meet Lillie at the same time. I smiled and accepted, me and Lillie told Jake that we would go back with him. Jake stood up and said that he would change Lillie so she took him to her room and 10 minutes later they came downstairs and Lillie looked adorable. Gr- looks like she\\'s got your looks son He laughed and then we got in the car with Jake sitting next to Lillie. We arrived 20 minutes later and just walked in. Jakes PoV: I was very thankful that Dad agreed to let Logan meet Lillie, once we pulled up I picked up Lillie and carried her inside. Dad was getting her bag and then followed us, as soon as I set foot inside I heard Pitch Perfect... Great... I shook my head and walked into the lounge where everyone was. I sang along when Anna Kendrick started to sing from the breakfast bunch. Jake: As you walk on by I SING LA LALA LA LA LA LALA LA! Everyone turned and started laughing at me, I put Lillie down and she went straight to the couch and was singing along. Erika looked confused and then I texted her everything, she nodded her head and was singing and dancing with Lillie. Logan then came down the stairs and dad had walked inside properly by the time Logan was in the Kitchen. J- Lillie, I would like you to meet someone... She turned and looked at me but then saw Logan and she went red in the face, I picked her up and went towards Logan. J-Lillie, meet Logan, your brother... Li: I got two broders? Me and Logan nodded and then she pulled us and hugged us, we smiled and hugged back. Dad looked really happy but then our Mom walked in... P: WHY WOULD YOU BRING LILLIE HERE?! J- cover Lillie\\'s ears and take her outside *whispered to Logan* He nodded and took Lillie outside and covered her ears. J- MOM DONT FUCKING START! YOU KEPT IT A SECRET FROM US THAT WE HAD A SISTER! Everyone slowly migrated outside and were with Logan and Lillie talking, Erika stayed with me incase I did anything stupid. P: ANYWAY WHERE WERE YOU?! ME AND DAVID HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYWHERE! J- I WAS WITH A PARENT WHO ACTUALLY RESPECTS ME! EVER SINCE YOU AND DAVID GOT TOGETHER AND WHEN WE MET HIM YOUVE BEEN TAKING HIS SIDE! LETTING HIM BE A DICK TO ME! Rik: Please calm down Babe... J- I CANT FUCKING CALM DOWN! MY PARENTS LIED TO ME AND LOGAN! Erika then came up behind me and started rubbing small circles in my back with her thumb, she was trying to calm me down but it didn\\'t work... D- WHATS GOING ON IN HERE?! JAKE GET YOUR ASS OUTSIDE SO THE GROWNUPS CAN TALK! J- NO! YOU THINK YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT TO DO WELL YOU CANT DO JACK SHIT TO ME! I WONT DO FUCKING ANYTHING! Gr- jaker... calm down... J- THIS IS BULLSHIT! NO ONE UNDERSTANDS WHATS GOING ON! Erika tried making me calm down but I couldn\\'t she then got me to look at her. Rik: Jake... look at me... I didn\\'t look at her the first time and I could tell she was getting worried as I started tensing. Rik: Jake look at me... Once I looked at her she whispered something in my ear which I couldn\\'t understand, I nodded my head anyway but continued to shout at my parents and David. DP- Explain then! J- what\\'s the actual point? I could tell you but then you all would start fighting and I\\'m honestly about to give up on life altogether! Rik: Jake... J- Erika don\\'t, let me do this! She nodded and told them to brace themselves for a massive information load. J- I\\'ve had to deal with you and dad arguing since it first started! I couldn\\'t believe what I was hearing and then you both got pissy with me about school! Which I got bullied before I turned into the troublemaker! Once when you were fighting I blamed it on myself and started cutting which I still do but no one would notice as everyone, mainly you two, were too busy fighting at each other and I swear to god I will tell everyone what I got called during one of your fights unless you stop being on David\\'s side constantly and fighting with him! It brings back memories! I\\'ve started hating my life and that got me thinking about suicide which I attempted when Logan hooked up with Alissa, she used my own brother to get to me and it worked! I went dead silent and looked at the ground, Erika came up in front of me and tried getting me to open up but I just said the one thing that broke me. David then came up to me and punched me, I didn\\'t fall to the floor but it caused the side of my head to start bleeding. He continued to punch the side of my head until my dad stopped him, Erika rushed me into the bathroom and cleaned me up. Rik: Jakey, how do you feel? J- extremely dizzy, I can\\'t focus my eyes at all... I leaned my head against the wall and closed my eyes, my head was pounding and it wasn\\'t helping at all. (A/N: forgot to mention but he\\'s sitting on the bath side.) Erika kissed me on the top of my forehead and stayed with me until my head stopped spinning, the bleeding stopped but the pain hadn\\'t vanished. We walked out into the lounge and everyone was back inside but my Mom, Logan, David and my dad were outside. We sat down on the couch and I leant my head back, Erika snuggled into my chest and watched me close my eyes. Li: Dake? J- yes lil? Li: I\\'m scared... J- hey, come here She then climbed onto my lap and snuggled into Erika and I, i eventually fell asleep and soon enough Erika and Lillie had as well. My head was killing me and we all had to go WestLake tomorrow and I knew that I would end up with more then a concussion tomorrow.'][Chapter 11] ['Erika\\'s PoV: I can\\'t believe what I just witnessed! David just punched Jake! I rushed him into the bathroom and sat him on the bath side, Jakes head was bleeding and I was cleaning it up. Rik: Jakey, how do you feel? J- extremely dizzy, I can\\'t focus my eyes at all... He leaned his head against the wall and shut his eyes, I sat next to him and rubbed little circles into his thigh. After awhile we then walked back into the lounge to find everyone in there, they all caught a glimpse at the side of Jakes head but he ignored it and sat down. Soon Jake had fell asleep and me and Lillie were cuddled up together for a bit before we both fell asleep as well. 20 minutes later, I was woken up by my step dad, Dan? I looked around and everyone else had left but me, Jake and Lillie were still cuddled up together on the couch. I got up slowly and carefully and said my goodbyes to everyone then left with Dan, I felt extremely bad for Jake as he would have to deal with David for the entire time we were here. I decided to tell Dan what David had done to Jake as I knew Dan thought of Jake as a son. Rik: Dad? Da- Yes Rik? Rik: can I tell you something that I only want you to know? Da- of course! Rik: did you see the cut on the side of Jakes face? Da- yes, why? Rik: I watched his Step Dad do that to him, then his dad stopped him from hurting Jake more... I heard him gasp and knew that he was concerned for Jakes well-being. I looked down and I felt his hand on my thigh, I looked up and he smiled at me before he reassured me that Jake would be fine and that they would do everything they could to help Jake. Once we got back I got this text from an unknown number. Chat~~ Unknown: Thanks for helping today! Rik: do I know you? Unknown: sorry, it\\'s Greg. Thanks for helping Jake today! Rik: its fine! I love him sooo much and wouldn\\'t want anything to happen to him. Greg- keep an eye on Jake at school please, he collapsed earlier from anxiety and stress. Rik: WHAT! Greg- yep, I was so scared! Rik: I\\'ll make sure to keep an eye on him! Greg- thanks! It\\'s Lillies bed time so I need to go but thanks so much for being there for Jake when I wasn\\'t! Rik: it\\'s fine and it\\'s not your fault that the marriage didn\\'t work out! Anyway I\\'ve got to go as well! End of chat... Everyone looked at me sympathetically and I was so confused, Dan walked in after me so I knew that he hadn\\'t said anything. Rik: Whats going on guys? Angel: Dani is getting bullied, she got a text and then multiple others which were really rude and mean towards her... Rik: where is she? Angel: she\\'s in her room and doesn\\'t know that you\\'re here... And with that I ran upstairs into her room and walked in, JC was in there as well and they both hugged me. I missed them sooooooo much as i had moved up to Albuquerque with Sunny and Tessa. Rik: JC, Dani!!!! JCDani- ERIKA!!! Rik: how bad is it at WestLake? And dani I know that you\\'re getting bullied now... JC- it\\'s really bad, people have started committing and it\\'s just another bad session. Rik: the golden boys will be at school tomorrow so go straight to them and they will make it stop. They both smiled at me and I smiled back. Dani: how is Jake? I sighed, how would I answer that? He\\'s a cutter? He\\'s in an abusive relationship with his Step Dad or that he\\'s fine? I never like lying to my siblings but I couldn\\'t say the truth otherwise Jake would be in trouble with David even more! Rik: not in a good place, let\\'s just say he\\'s been hurting physically, mentally and emotionally. We all were engulfed in an comfortable silence until my phone broke it. I checked who it was and it was Logan calling me. On call: Rik: Logan? What\\'s up? L- Jake... Rik: WHAT?! IS HE OKAY? L- David decided to piss him off and now Jake has gone off somewhere... Rik: omg... where do you think he would be? L- most likely somewhere, he can punch the living daylights out of things. Rik: I\\'ll try texting him and I\\'ll call you if i convince him to come to mine okay? L- that\\'s fine, thanks Erika! Rik: it\\'s okay Logan! End of call Start of chat: TrickyRik️: Jake? TrickyRik️: Logan\\'s worried TrickyRik️: please answer me! Pizzy Paul️: what erika?... TrickyRik️: come round mine, Dan won\\'t mind!️ Pizzy Paul️: are you sure? xx TrickyRik️: yes! xx Pizzy Paul️: okay, ill be over in a bit xx End of chat with Jake Start of Chat with Logan: TrikyRik: Jakes coming round mine Logan. LoganPool: okay thanks. Bet you\\'re wondering what David did huh? TrikyRik: yep. LoganPool: he started like calling him a waste of space, a piss take and all of that TrikyRik: I\\'ll talk to him about it when he gets here! End of chat JC and Dani stared at me as I was screaming into my phone, I eventually gave in when they both looked concerned about what was up with Jake. Rik: Jake and his Step Dad, David, got into a fight and now Jake went off somewhere. Thankfully I just convinced him to come here! Dani: Well go tell Dad and Mom then! JC- I\\'ll go with you, I need to ask mom something anyway. I nodded and we both walked downstairs, we caught the attention of Mom and Dan and then I sighed. Rik: I invited Jake over, his Step dad\\'s being a complete jerk to him and plus Logan just called me saying that Jake went somewhere and was worried about him. Dan nodded and so did mom and before we knew it Jake had arrived, Dan let him in and as soon as I saw his eyes red and puffy I ran straight to him and hugged him tightly. He pulled away and looked at me, I could tell that he was holding on to a little thread and soon enough he was gonna break and it wouldn\\'t be pretty. I rubbed his arm and held his waist, JC then came and gave him a fist bump. Jake was surprised when Dani didn\\'t come down but then I took him upstairs to see her, she smiled and instantly hugged him. I\\'m guessing Dani felt really safe on Jakes arms because she held on tight and Jake didn\\'t mind at all. Jake put her down and sat on her bed with her, I sat on Jakes lap and we all laid down and watched Pitch Perfect of course! Jake leaned his head on my shoulder and filmed me and Dani singing, he posted it with this caption: \\'Double trouble, WestLake better get ready as there\\'s a storm comin\\' I laughed at the caption then decided to post a picture of him and tag him, I got a photo from my camera roll and posted it: I tagged him and added this caption, \\'Literally the best ever, he asked me who I thought was better. Him, Cole Sprouse or Zac Efron? I would have to say that he\\'s up there!️ @jakepaul️\\' I saw him comment something and once I read it I laughed so much! \\'@erikacostell, you still never answered it! But you have to admit my 6 pack has got to be better then Coles! Like I swear he doesn\\'t even have one️\\' Dani stared at us but once she checked her phone her small smile disappeared, I grabbed her phone and looked at all the hate she was getting. Jake then stole her phone and messaged them all back and they were all correct! \"Guys, It\\'s Jake Paul and I would really appreciate it if you left her alone before I have to get involved! Y\\'all are so stupid to lose someone as nice and pretty as Dani! Y\\'all should be ashamed of yourselves! If she gets one more hate comment at either School or on any social media platforms it won\\'t be pretty for you guys! Have y\\'all ever wondered what hospital walls look like?\" Once Dani took her phone back we were both shocked but she immediately thanked Jake and showed mom the message and she thanked Jake as well although the hospital message was a bit much it still worked! Me and Jake snuggled up to each other in my room and fell asleep for the second time that day, although we had school the next day I was so happy with the moment that I never wanted it to end. Time Skip* Jakes PoV: I spent the night round Erika\\'s and I was very thankful that Dan and Angel didn\\'t mind me staying, I got up around 5:30 and went downstairs and made breakfast for everyone. By the time everyone was awake breakfast was ready, Angel looked completely shocked as I had made scrambled eggs, bacon. Well pretty much a big English breakfast for everyone, Erika hugged and thanked me as did Dani and JC. Dan and Angel however were too shocked to speak as they have never had anyone make breakfast for them before. Da- what time did you get up to make this? J- 5:30, hope you all enjoy it! Angel: what about you? What will you eat? J- I made myself a smaller version and ate that around 20 minutes ago. Rik: thanks Dino! You can use my shower to get ready if you want? J- thanks and I swear I have some of my old clothes here?! Angel: we kept them in case Erika missed you so she had a part of you Everyone except Dan and Angel- Awwwwwwwwweee I walked upstairs and took a shower, that breakfast had been the only thing I had eaten in days and I knew Erika would have forced me to eat so I ate that to please her. I stripped myself of my clothes and hopped into her shower, I looked at my cuts and the majority had started healing whilst the rest were slowly bleeding a little bit. I was in the shower for an extra 10 minutes before I got changed into some shorts and my second Cavaliers Jersey that I had left there. I walked downstairs and saw Logan, Lillie and my dad talking to Dan and Angel. My shoes must have startled them because when they all looked at me their eyes were wide. Lillie was on the floor so once she saw me she ran straight to me and I picked her up and held her there for awhile. Dani then came down the stairs and once she saw Lillie she was immediately at her side and was tickling her. I put Lillie down and then Dani took her to the couch and they were laughing and playing, I sighed as I looked at them but then came back to reality once Logan started talking to me. L- Jake? J- ... L- Jake?... J- huh? What? L- you good? J- I\\'m good... L- anyways we need to talk to you about the fight last night and stuff. J- what stuff? L- what David said... I looked down, I didn\\'t want to tell anyone about what he said as it brought tears to my eyes although I hated him it still hurt that he said that. J- what\\'s there to talk about it?! You heard everything! Both of you did! L- we wanna tell Angel and Dan about it, so then if you wanna talk to someone other then us then you can... I nodded and then started telling them, I didn\\'t realise that Erika was listening until I felt her arms wrap around my waist. I turned around instantly and needed to ask her what she had heard. J- Erika... h-how much of that did you hear?... Rik: enough, anyway I was meaning to talk to you about that. Logan told me when he called me last night what he said and I wanted to know how you took it?... I looked at her for about a couple seconds before looking at my shoes and having my hands in my short pockets. When Erika asked if I was Alright I shrugged my shoulders, I wasn\\'t in the mood and to top it all off my head was still pounding like a little fucker. Erika lifted my chin up using her fingers and made me look at her, she held such a sympathetic facial expression. I moved my face out of hers and sat down on the stairs, I leaned my head against the wall and closed my eyes. Erika sat next to me and started singing like she did last time I was upset, Erika: The day we met Frozen i held my breath Right from the start I knew that I\\'d found A home for my heart Beats fast Colours and promises How to be brave How can I love When I\\'m afraid to fall But watching you stand alone All of my doubt Suddenly goes away somewhere One step closer I have died everyday Waiting for you Darling don\\'t be afraid I have loved you For a thousand years I\\'ll love you for a thousand more I opened my eyes and Erika was looking at me and smiled, I had a really small smile but I still smiled. I was about to say something when the bus pulled up and that meant we had to go to school, I stood up and walked straight out the door and right onto the bus, Erika and Logan soon followed and eventually we left for school. I was sitting at the back and had my eyes closed, Troy and Chad were sitting in front of me and could tell something was up. T- dude you good? C- yeah you seem off J- the sooner this day is over the better... The Karaoke machine kicked in and someone put on Jerika... Jake: Used to call you mom but Now I call you wifey There\\'s no death row but I\\'m doing it for lifey And now we are on a honeymoon Chillin\\' in Hawaii And whenever we kiss it\\'s just so Spicy Both: Get over here, get your mind right Don\\'t erase my name to the last one Quavo, you should take your mask off We should take our pants off We should make a dance song Erika: Put my ass in a Tesla Jake: Give you all my best love Both: You make me feel special That\\'s why I love you forever Something just feels right When we\\'re together I think I wanna stay here with you for Forever, for, forever, forever and ever And ha Oh Oh Oh Oh Forever Oh Oh Oh Oh Forever Kade: Seen a lot of thangs Put her on a block I be her best uncle just give me One shot Just now I\\'m on team and trying Don\\'t stop Cause family vloggers are so hot What\\'s next?

Considering we had to make new music for homecoming me, Anthony and Sunny decided to sing \"My Teachers\" Jake: My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that) How to deal with this or that How to make my papers stack How to get a DM back How to buy a Lambo cash My teachers never taught me that My teachers never liked me one bit They said I would amount to be shit They thought I was just another misfit I had to make like a banana and split Now, Jakey in a mansion Got 8 builders for expansion All these diamonds on my dances Mrs Clause just see me flashin\\' My lambo hit the gas All these Prius\\' I\\'m passim\\' Doin\\' Sixty, Calabasas Man I feel like Kim Kardashian My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that) How to deal with this or that How to make my papers stack How to get a DM back How to buy a Lambo cash My teachers never taught me that Sunny: My teachers said I needed to get up On my grades I need to get my B\\'s and raise them to My A\\'s I walk in the class, got supreme on my J\\'s You always tryna hate but you got Nothing to say I\\'m almost at the top I\\'m the young LeBron James I\\'m not the same in my own brain I\\'m in a different lane It\\'s yo girl Sunny Call me Mrs Stay-On-Top I\\'m on this rocket Killin\\' this game And this a bop Jake: My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that) How to deal with this or that How to make my papers stack How to get a DM back How to buy a Lambo cash My teachers never taught that Tony: Neva\\' taught me how to flow And I be on the beats Skippin\\' class all day There be F\\'s all on my sheets Detentions everyday Got me kicked off the team The teachers never cared about my California Dream I was nothin\\' Just a nerd like mcloving My teachers frontin\\' Talkin\\' shit cause I\\'m nothin\\' Now I\\'m somethin\\' Speakers bumpin\\' Crowd Jumpin\\' Got my wrist flooded Girls lovin\\' Whips! Jake: (Damn) My teachers never taught me that (My teachers never taught me that) How to be this or that How to make my papers stack How to get a DM back How to buy a Lambo cash My teachers never taught me that! Everyone clapped and then Erika put on our new group song, Kade and Chance were ill the day we made this so they couldn\\'t be on the song.

As soon as we all stepped foot on the ground Dani and JC came running towards us and I knew that we had to stop the bullying, Team 10 cleared up a bench and we all stood on it. I then shouted, J- WE ARE BACK BITCHES! Everyone stared at us and looked petrified, I smirked as did Team 10. Ka- Y\\'ALL BETTER STOP THIS SHIT AIMED AT PEOPLE BEFORE PEOPLE END UP IN THE HOSPITAL! Ch- WE KNOW ALL ABOUT HOW BAD THE BULLYING HAS CAME SO DONT MAKE US HAVE TO GET INVOLVED! A- IT WONT BE PRETTY IF WE HAVE TO! J- IF Y\\'ALL GOT THAT MESSAGE FROM ME LAST NIGHT I STAND BY THAT COMPLETELY! I DONT GIVE TWO SHITS ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK! YOU DONT LIKE SOMEONE IGNORE THEM, DONT MAKE THEM WANNA COMMIT! X- NOW YOU CAN ALL FUCK OFF! And they did, everyone ran to their lessons and it was completely empty. But then the football team came up to me once I climbed down from the bench. The leader, Dave, came up to me and stared at me. Dave- Look who\\'s back guys! Mr. Suicide! J- look who grew big boy legs and can finally have the guts to come and speak to me! ???: Go cut yourself! J- you guys are unbelievable! ???: what I don\\'t understand is that you guys bullied people into depression yet we aren\\'t allowed to! J- you don\\'t fucking get it! Dave- well it\\'s the exact same here only thing is, is that the people we bully end it! I squared up in Dave\\'s face but then Chance said, Ch- dude, their not worth it! ???: Dave, teach him a lesson about talking shit to your face! And with that he tried punching me but I blocked it, he looked shocked but I just smiled. Soon enough the entire football team was fighting me and then Team 10 jumped in, I eventually got pulled off of Dave and he had his eyes opened wide. Dave-L-Logan?... L- get the fuck away from my brother before I let him rip you apart... J- nope! Let me fucking at him Logan! Dave- YEAH LET US FIGHT! C.B- how about you boys run along before you all get kicked off the team! And I have my ways! They all scattered and then our Girlfriends had to look at our \\'injuries\\' Erika rushed over to me and looked me over, I had a slightly black eye, a bloody nose, a cut lip and the side of my head was completely blood, like you couldn\\'t even see the skin. Rik: EWWWWWWW... Everyone except Erika- WHAT? J- Erika?... Rik: DAVE BROKE YOUR NOSE!... J- are you sure? Take a picture! Erika then took a picture of my nose and you could see it really clearly where he broke my nose. J- you can\\'t even tell! Rik: NO YOU CAN! J- I can\\'t feel it so I dunno Rik: WE ARE GOING TO GO GET YOU CLEANED UP BY THE NURSE! C\\'MON BOYS! We all went to the Nurse whilst the rest of the teams went to meet Mrs Clark. The order in the office went Chance, Tony, Kade, Chad, Emilio, Ivan, Nathan then me. Once they were all checked out they waited for me whilst the Nurse called Kayleigh tried straightening my nose. Kayleigh: this might hurt Jake J- okay... She couldn\\'t do it but she cleaned my face up and she told me to go see a doctor but after that she let me go, once I walked out Chance and the others gasped at my nose. Ch- dude, Erika was right. Your nose is definitely broken! Ka- yeah it\\'s really disgusting almost! E- your nose... is like dis *hand gestures to show its at a side* I- are you sure that you okay? I nodded and shoved my hands in my short pockets before walking to Mrs Clark\\'s room with my head down, Chance wrapped his arm around my shoulders and wanted to know what was up. Ch- what\\'s up Jake? I shrugged my shoulders and kept my head down, first Erika and now the guys but I guess I should tell them considering we made a pact. J- David... Ka- what happened? J- he called me a waste of space and just like pissed me off, I know that I hate him but it still hurt that he said that. Kade rubbed my back and everyone else looked at me sympathetically I shrugged and we walked to class, we looked into the classrooms and we saw a lot of our old friends. I noticed that Dani was outside when we walked past her class, she looked like she was crying so I kneeled down, ignoring free pain that killed my knee. J- Dani?... Dani: ... J- come here... We hugged and then the teacher came out and explained it to us, I wanted to speak to the class and she allowed me to. J- who started it?! The class was dead silent and they all looked guilty. J- who started it?! Don\\'t make me ask again! One girl in the back raised her hand and I let her explain. ???: basically Dani was being a bitch to us! I laughed and they all stared at me. J- now that\\'s funny, I\\'ve known Dani since she was born and I know that she would never act like that to anyone so maybe you started it. Dani: thanks Jake I smiled at Dani but then the girl shouted at me. ???: SERIOUSLY! WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT SLUT! MY BROTHER DAVE COULD BEAT YOUR ASS! J- the football team captain right? She nodded and I smirked. J- really, then how come this morning all he did was give me a broken nose huh? She went a deep crimson colour and that\\'s when I knew I had won. J- thanks for the \\'W\\' now if you could leave her alone before I have to come back that would be awesome! I walked out of the class and I smiled at Dani, I reassured her that if they messed with her again I won\\'t be as controlled as I was last time. She hugged me and the teacher gave us another pass to give to Mrs Clark. With 20 minutes left of the lesson we walked in and handed her and coach the notes before sitting down, Erika looked confused but I explained to her that Dani had some trouble and that I sorted it for her. She smiled and rubbed my thigh, my abdomen was giving me extreme pains and the boys had it as well. I had my head in my hands and Erika was whispering things into my ears whilst all the others did the same to their boyfriends. Mrs Clark: is everything alright boys?... Rik: Jake?... you good?... J- ... C.B- boys?... X except the girls- ... We had one of our hands on the area where it was giving us the most pain and suddenly our hands all got sticky, we looked down and our hands were covered in blood. And that was the last thing we could remember...'][Chapter 12] ['Erika\\'s PoV: One minute Jake and the guys were fine the next they were on their way to the hospital, they had all passed out and we were all worried sick about them. Once we arrived at the hospital we all had to wait in the reception area, Pam, David, Brad, Crystal and the other parents all arrived with Coach Bolton and the others right behind him. Everyone filled up the waiting room and soon enough the doctor was asking for the family members of the guys. My mom and dad arrived later on and hugged me, I cried into my dad\\'s chest as I wanted Jake to be okay. Dave was such an idiot! I explained everything to the police and everyone\\'s parents before the nurse could let us see them. Nurse: okay so the others are awake, Jake isn\\'t yet as his weight is making it harder for him. All the boys had a massive cut like stab wound on their abdomen leading to them all passing out and bleeding. You can all go see them now, with Jake talk to him and that can make all the difference. We all walked to their room and we all cried, I would have collapsed to the floor if it wasn\\'t for Logan. He held me as I cried into his chest and I knew he was crying as well, once I calmed down we both walked over to Jake and I kissed him on his forehead. I was talking to him and I saw his eyes flutter open but he immediately winced in pain and put his hand right where it was. I kissed him and he kissed back, his pain soon vanished and I noticed that his nose was fixed. Rik: your nose is fixed *laughing* He smiled and nodded, I guess he was too out of it to talk. Coach then walked in and sighed as he looked at all of them. C.B- they said you all could still play you would just have to take it easy is all. J- okay... C.B- Jake? J- yeah... C.B- when was the last time you had a proper meal? Not breakfast like a proper meal... J- a couple of days ago why? C.B- it affected you waking up you could say and they said that your weight was worrying. I helped Jake sit up and he looked confused but I explained it to him more and he understood. The nurse soon came in and explained that they needed rest so we left them to sleep, they were coming home tomorrow so we all left and went back home. We all snuggled up at Jakes and watched Frozen, once Let it Go came on we were all singing along. Pam and the others except Mr Trujillo had to run some errands so they all left and we were all joking around with him. Brad- you girls should make a party for the guys tomorrow seeing as their coming home tomorrow! X except Brad and the guys- OMG YESSSSSSSS! Te: where should we have it? Brad- I\\'ll convince Pam to have it here Rik: WE CAN DO KARAOKE! Brad- oh god... Te: they do it with us all the time! Ali: mainly because we force them but oh well! We all giggled and then I got this text from Jake... In Chat: Pizzy Paul️: hey xx TrickyRik️: hey, what\\'s up? xx Pizzy Paul️: other then the sky I\\'m bored, wbu? xx TrickyRik️: watching Frozen round yours xx Pizzy Paul️: at least it ain\\'t Pitch Perfect! xx TrickyRik️: how bored are you? xx Pizzy Paul️: that\\'s the thing, I dunno xx TrickyRik️: only you wouldn\\'t know how bored you are xx Pizzy Paul️: I miss you!!! xx TrickyRik️: you\\'re back tomorrow! xx Pizzy Paul️: they fount out about David and the cuts...

TrickyRik: SHUT THE FUCK UP SHARPAY! Pizzy Paul: it\\'s fine and thanks Rik, anyway I was going out with Alissa Violet and it started getting abusive and like each time the guys saw me with a new cut or bruise they\\'d freak out, and then I walked home one day and I saw Alissa fucking my brother. I may have been in an abusive relationship but that same day I tried something and thankfully it didn\\'t work... Troy Bolton️: sorry dude... Pizzy Paul: it\\'s fine. Look I gotta bounce so see you guys tomorrow. X except Jake- K bye! We all stopped typing and Tessa was comforting me once Jake told everyone what happened, I hadn\\'t heard the entire thing all I knew was that his brother fucked his girlfriend. Suddenly my phone buzzed and it was from my post yesterday, I checked it and there were thousands of hate comments towards Jake. Me and the girls were reading them when one got to me and made me cry, Tessa was still comforting me and at this point I was crying into her. Te: Rik?... Rik: ... Ma: what did the comment say?... Rik: ... Te: MR TRUJILLO! And with that he came sprinting down the stairs and saw me looking distressed. Brad- what\\'s up? Te: look at Erika\\'s latest post and read the comments... He did as Tessa said and he looked mortified, I pulled my head out of Tessa\\'s neck and called my dad. He didn\\'t answer so I called my mom, she didn\\'t answer either and when everyone else tried calling their parents they didn\\'t answer either. I called Logan and he didn\\'t answer either, I was so confused that they didn\\'t answer. I checked the time and the clock read 12:35pm, that meant it was lunch time at WestLake so I called JC and he answered... On call: JC- Erika? What\\'s up? Rik: Tell dani that I\\'m round Jakes. JC- Wait why are you there? Rik: the guys are in the hospital because the football team technically stabbed them... JC- OMG! Rik: also Mom, Dad and like Tessa\\'s parents and all of them won\\'t answer except Mr Trujillo so if anything happens at school tell the school to contact him okay? JC- okay, thanks for letting me know. Should we meet you there then? Rik: yeah, okay bye! JC- Bye! Dani\\'s PoV: Once Jake spoke to the class they all left me alone which I was extremely grateful for, something was still on my mind though. Once Jake first saw me he looked like he was going to faint and when he kneeled down he was in TONS of pain, I\\'m guessing he shrugged off the concerned look I gave him because JC just told me that the guys were admitted to the hospital! It was the end of the day and I met JC and we walked all the way to Jakes house, Erika was inside and so were all the girls. Erika had red, puffy bags underneath her eyes and that meant she had been crying, I went straight to her and hugged her, JC did the same. She smiled a little bit but then she had to tell us what was up, I sat on her lap and JC sat to the right of her as Tessa was on the left. Rik: not only is Jake in the hospital people are being complete jerks to him! Me and JC stared at her confused until Tessa showed us the comments on her post. I started getting tears in my eyes and JC did as well because I saw him wipe something away from his eyes. It was an extra 30 minutes before our parents all arrived at Jakes and they saw all of us with red, puffy faces. Dan- what happened?... Brad- look at Erika\\'s latest Instagram post and the comments are disgusting! Angel: WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US EARLIER?! Rik: because no one picked up! I called all of you and no one answered so then I called JC and told him to walk here with Dani! Te: Also, David be careful! David- why? Rik: the police fount out what you were doing to Jake and now he has to tell the cops, EVERYTHING! David- I NEVER TOUCHED HIM! Rik: SURE WHEN I WATCHED YOU REPEATEDLY PUNCH HIM IN THE HEAD AND GIVE HIM ONE OF THE CUTS ON THE SIDE OF HIS FACE! P: ERIKA HE DIDNT TOUCH JAKE! Rik: ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW! PAM YOU SAW HIM DO IT!! Erika broke down into tears and our dad held her, the group joined in and so did me, JC and our mom. We death stared both Pam and David before Logan jumped in. L- mom, you have to choose. We can\\'t live with this anymore... is it me and Jake or David who could potentially end up killing Jake?... Pam looked conflicted but one look at David and it made her mind up, she clearly chose David over her own sons and with that Logan walked out and went straight to his dad\\'s. Brad- WHAT KIND OF A MOTHER ARE YOU?! YOU CHOSE THE PERSON WHO STARTED HURTING YOUR SON OVER YOUR BOY WHO IS IN THE HOSPITAL! IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD CHOOSE MY SON COMPLETELY! We all left and no one could sleep at all, Erika spent the night crying whilst me and JC comforted her. Logan then texted me and I understood why... In Chat: Logan: alright, my dad is applying for custody over me and Jake. I\\'m gonna tell him and everyone else that tomorrow, my dad is buying the house in Albuquerque from my mom and I\\'m telling you this because anyone else would tell Erika so please don\\'t. Dani️: dw, I won\\'t! End of chat We stopped texting and Erika finally fell asleep for the first time that night and me and JC fell asleep as well, we got woken up to Erika\\'s alarm and we noticed that she was already up and changed, we dashed to get changed in our rooms and we were done by the time breakfast was ready. Coach Bolton allowed us to travel with Erika considering last nights incident, we arrived to school and Erika got her schedule and headed to her lesson whilst me and JC parted ways. Erika\\'s PoV: I was so happy once the day was over and we picked up the guys from the hospital, we all spent a lot of time into their party and hopefully David and Pam wouldn\\'t ruin it. I felt so bad for Jake and Logan as their own mother ditched them for her husband! Once we arrived at Jakes we walked in and the banner was up and everything was set up, we had this video playing of all the memories from Cleveland and had the song \"What we came here for\" playing in the background. Logan then announced that he had to say something. L- okay, Jake and the guys won\\'t know what\\'s going on but basically Jake. Dad\\'s applying for custody of us... X except Logan- WHAT?! J- why?! L- mom chose David over us... I heard Jake sigh and I saw him look down but he then looked up then decided to pick me up and run into the pool with me. I gripped onto him but it wasn\\'t enough, when we swam back to the side everyone was laughing, filming it and our parents, who were making a barbecue for us, were staring at us! Just then these two men in cop outfits came and looked unimpressed, Jake got out of the pool and helped me up. We both changed then Jake had to speak to the cops about David and cutting... Jake\\'s PoV: Me, Erika, My dad, My Mom, Logan and David all sat down to talk for the cops. I was really nervous about it as i didn\\'t want anything bad to happen to my dad but with my mom it was a different story. She chose David over us and that made me feel extremely unwanted as it wasn\\'t fair. PO1: okay, Jake we need to ask you questions about your home life based off of the cuts. We will be voice recording this entire conversation and it won\\'t go anywhere else so please tell us the complete truth. PO2- where did this all start Jake? J- my entire life getting derailed? Hmmm, it all started when my parents got into arguments and I was having a hard time at school as it was... PO1: What was happening at school? J- I was getting bullied and like after that me and my friends— PO2- who are?... J- Anthony Trujillo, Chance Sutton, Kade Spieser, Nathan Spieser, Nick Crompton, Ivan and Emilio Martinez, Chad Tepper and a couple girls as well, Tessa Brooks, Erika Costell, Alissa Violet, Mackenzie Altig, Alex DeLena and that\\'s it became the naughty people, the girls weren\\'t really but the guys were. PO1: why? J- as soon as we started acting like the bad boys the bullying stopped but when Erika\\'s ex kept on calling her a slut and a prostitute I lost it and put him on life support. I couldn\\'t control how angry I was. PO2- okay, now when David came into your lives how did you both take it? LJ- horribly. L- as soon as our Mom answered the door and went outside David grabbed him by the wrist tightly and pinned Jake up against the wall, I tried getting him to stop but he only let go when we heard the front door open and close. J- I\\'ve got threats off of him, and when Logan tried finding out I didn\\'t let him. I came home, grabbed a knife and cut my arm and under my boxers where the elastic part is. L- he no longer cuts on his arm but I\\'ve been trying to get him to stop. J- it\\'s true he has. And you can read the message if you want I don\\'t care. I handed them my phone and they read the texts and then they took David\\'s phone and the numbers matched. Erika then butted in i was utterly confused. Rik: um, not only has Jake been getting hate from his Step Dad but I have evidence you could call it of people telling Jake to go cut himself and to go die. She handed the police her phone and they looked shocked completely. They gave our phones back to us and they let us go, apparently they had heard enough and arrested David on the spot. I was all smiles but that also meant that dad couldn\\'t be in custody of us. PO2- before we leave, Pam and Greg you both now have a shared custody over Jake Joseph Paul and Logan Alexander Paul! Me and Logan both smiled and Erika smiled as well! I was so happy with life and it was if I never considered suicide again! Once the police left Logan came up to me and was confused as to why I didn\\'t mention him and Alissa. L- dude, why didn\\'t you mention me and Alissa? J- because, I didn\\'t want anything to happen to you even though it wouldn\\'t have i didn\\'t wanna take the chance... We hugged and then our mom had tears in her eyes, I tried talking to her but she slapped me and left. \\'This\\'ll be fun for me\\' I thought and then me and Logan both walked outside. Everyone could see the hand print on the side of my face and was wondering what happened but I didn\\'t tell them. We explained that our mom left and I looked hurt but I didn\\'t care, she chose David over her two sons and she should have believed us but now she\\'s crying all because we stopped him from potentially killing me! time skip* It had been a couple days after David got arrested and Mom still hadn\\'t spoken to me, I started feeling guilt but i dunno I guess I kinda feel bad because that was Moms husband and she had to watch him get arrested for child abuse. I was getting ready for practise when I decided to film using my dad\\'s old camera, I remembered the last time I used his camera it was to film us doing the Truth or Dare Karaoke thing. I turned the camera and started talking to it: J- what\\'s up guys? I think I\\'m gonna start filming on here more, I think that it\\'ll be a good idea so y\\'all can see my life and maybe I can change someone else\\'s I guess. So basically I\\'m about to go practise for the game I\\'ve got coming up then I\\'ve got rehearsals for a show that me and Team 10 are doing so I guess I\\'ll film at practise! I turned the camera off and finished getting ready, we were all practising, well warming up, together and then we were split into our teams. Whilst we had our break I decided to film, I turned the camera on and pointed it at Troy, who looked dead on the floor, and he made a weird face. J- LOOK WHOS BACK, BACK AGAIN TELL YOUR FRIENDS! Dude, do you think I should start filming my life? T- I\\'d fully support you if you did! Ch- dude, I heard that there was this app called YouTube where you can post videos! J- I\\'ll look into that! I turned the camera off and finished practise then went to rehearsals and filmed there. I turned the camera on and Erika looked at me weirdly. J- okay so this is rehearsals for our show that\\'s coming up! That\\'s Erika! Rik: what is this Jake? J- I might start youtube okay! X except Jake- REALLY? J- yep! Te: can we have dope introduction things? J- if you must A- I\\'m Toner! Ch- *coughs* boner toner *coughs* A- shut it ice age squirrel! J- sadly those are my best friends from Ohio! And that\\'s where we are for the matches! NICKKKKKK Nick- WHAT?! J- HELP ME MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL! Nick- FINE! Rik: *coughs* Nake *coughs* Te: *laughing* J- seriously Mickey?! Rik: I will slap you! J- c\\'mon then *laughing* Erika then tried to slap me but I dodged it and started to tickle her and she couldn\\'t stop laughing, Nathan took the camera and looked as if he was a pro at filming as he didn\\'t miss any of the footage. J- Nathan, would you like to be my videographer? N- sure! J- okay so guys I\\'ll be back once we\\'ve got a break! Nathan turned the camera off and Erika looked surprised, according to her I was a natural at being on camera. We finished rehearsals and me and nick were looking at YouTube, I signed up and made a contract with them and BAMN my YouTube channel was created! I then sat down in front of the camera and decided to explain to the camera what I was gonna upload and all of that. J- okay so I\\'m Jake Paul and I am gonna upload vlogs on here, I am one of the vine stars! Okay so I think it\\'s time that I explain who will be in them and yeah! So first up we have Nick Crompton, he is the business person you could say of Team 10. We know that we are still in high school but I\\'m hoping to expand team 10 to a group of influencers, social media or not! He\\'s the one we go to say if we wanted to make deals or if we wanna collab with people. Next up is Erika Costell, she is a model and could be a business person as well but I\\'ll have to talk to her about that. She is the mom of the group and is my girlfriend! We then have Chance and Anthony, they are a package deal and both have girlfriends! They were also featured in one or two vines at the most. We then have their girlfriends Alex DeLena and Tessa Brooks! Tessa is a model/ dancer and is a influencer you could start calling us if you want. Alex DeLena also models and is also another influencer. We then have Chad Tepper and Emilio and Ivan Martinez, Emilio and Ivan are spanish, identical twins who are savages and are also dope influencers! Chad is a little more complex, he likes getting hit in the d*ck and has his own channel and has merch which is called \"Don\\'t come for me\". I literally have no idea what I\\'m saying, it\\'s 1 in the morning and I\\'m filming this *laughs with Nick* Nick- okay so then we will move onto Troy Bolton, he is an aspiring basketball player and has a good singing voice and has been in multiple musicals— J- why do you know more then me? I have known him longer but not longer then anyone else at East High! Nick- you can literally research everyone Jake... J- then why the f*ck am I saying all this sh*t? Nick- I have no idea but it\\'s actually really entertaining *laughs at jake* J- shut it nick *yawning* Nick- you go to sleep I\\'ll finish this! J- nahh I\\'m good *eyes half closed* Nick turned the camera off and forced me to go to bed and before long I was passed out! He didn\\'t finish the vlog and it was the weekend so I could finish the outro/ intros to team 10 the next day... Nick robbed my camera and decided to wake me up, I was calmly sleeping when he suddenly threw whipped cream on my face and slapped it. J- NICK YOU DICK! Nick- YOURE WELCOME JAKE! And I\\'ve came up with a fandom name, the Jake Paulers! J- ooooo, that\\'s perfect bro! Now let me finish the outro god dammit! Nick- come on then! You have to get in the game if you\\'re gonna make this work! J- why are you so down for this? Nick- because I have jack sh*t to do! I laughed and walked downstairs and finished the outro for Nick and even added the whipped cream part into the vlog. I posted it and sent it to all of my friends to watch and soon enough it went viral that Nick Crompton slapped me. I chilled and vlogged a little bit before deciding to get some more food, Erika had to make sure I was eating but when she wasn\\'t around I didn\\'t eat at all. I didn\\'t care about the consequences as it was my choice, my mom could care less at this point considering I got her husband arrested. J- should I do this daily, Nick?... Nick- it\\'s your choice! And I\\'d fully support you either way! I was on my phone I looked at the comments on Erika\\'s post, they hadn\\'t been taken down so I read EVERY SINGLE ONE. I sighed and put my phone down, I walked outside and sat by the pool edge. I needed to think because of people want me dead then that\\'ll make me seem weak but I can\\'t stay and cut because then people would think it\\'s a smart idea and then I\\'d have to deal with the repercussions afterwards. I couldn\\'t think straight so I leaned back until I was laying on the floor and shut my eyes, since when did life get so complicated? I then started thinking about how Logan wanted to take me up to LA so we could grow more with Vine, I smiled at that thought. I wanted to go up to LA with him and this would be my chance, but then the thought of leaving everyone behind made me rethink it. I then had a smart idea, if I wanted Team 10 to be a business then I could fly them out and buy a house up there for the Team to live in! But some of the others would want to stay in Albuquerque and finish College. All I knew was that if this hate didn\\'t stop I would pull out and go with Logan to LA, I didn\\'t realise how long I had been out here until I noticed Erika sitting next to me. J- Erika? How long have you been here? Rik: awhile, I would have came earlier but I had stuff to do. J- ahh okay... Rik: you seemed pretty deep at thought, what\\'s up?... J- thinking about my future and Team 10\\'s future... I sighed and shut my eyes again, I wanted to tell Erika about my plan but I couldn\\'t. Well just yet anyways, I wanted to see what she was doing after high school but I couldn\\'t talk to her about it. She started playing with my hair and it made all my stress disappear, it made me feel surprisingly calm. Rik: actually I need to talk to you about that... J- why, what\\'s up?... Rik: after high school I\\'m moving to LA because of my modelling career... I leaned in and kissed her, she kissed back and we both pulled away for air. Erika looked confused but I just smiled, I couldn\\'t believe that I could spend my time after High School with her! I was ecstatic and you could clearly see it! Rik: as much as I loved that, why?... J- I was thinking about my future in LA, Logan offered to fly me up there... Rik: ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?!... J- nahhh I said it for the fun of it! Of course I\\'m fucking serious!... She squealed and hugged me. I hugged back and we stayed all cuddled up until I realised that I was thinking about when I drop out. The smile I had on my face vanished and that meant I would have to wait months for school to end! Rik: hey, you good?... J- yeah... I\\'m fine... Rik: Jake?... J- uhhh... I need to find Logan... And with the I got up and ran to find Logan, thankfully he was round Dad\\'s so I just walked there, when I saw someone I hadn\\'t seen since I was 5...'][Chapter 13] ['RomanAtwood\\'s PoV: I hadn\\'t seen Jake or Logan since they were 5 so I decided to come surprise them! I brought my sons Kane and Noah, My wife, Brittney and our daughter, Cora. (A/N: this is set after they got married in Maui) we were all chilling when Jake came and he looked shocked, I hugged him and so did Brittney, Noah, Kane and Cora. J- OMG... IVE MISSED YOU GUYS SO MUCH! Roman- Jake we would like you to meet someone, this is Cora... our daughter... Jakes PoV: I picked her up and started tickling her and her giggle was so cute! I put her down and she ran around chasing after Noah and Kane! J- HURRIKANE!, TEENAGER!... They came running straight at me and I picked them both up and threw them over my shoulders. They were screaming and it made me laugh so much! Logan then came down the stairs and looked surprised as to why I was there but that\\'s when I remembered that I had to talk to him. J- Logan... L- what\\'s up? You giving me an answer?... J- let\\'s do it!... I put Kane and Noah down and went up to Logan and said it to his face once more, Logan was more shocked at this point and he then had a smile plastered on his face... Gr- what are you two up to? L- after Jakes graduation we are moving up to LA!... Brittney: awwww, good luck boys! JL- thanks! I had a smile on my face and I had yet to tell Logan that Erika was moving up to LA as well! J- Logan?... L- what?... J- Erika\\'s getting moved to LA after graduation as well! L- #FAMILY GOALS!!! J- SHUT UP LOGAN! DONT MAKE ME TELL EVERYONE ABOUT... L- PLEASE DONT! J- actually it\\'ll make us even after the whole Alissa situation!... L- oh god it will! J- LOGAN AND CHLOE BENNET ARE A THING!... We all laughed and then migrated round to our Moms, they were curious as to where she was and I was getting worried because we hadn\\'t seen her since David was arrested. As soon as I stepped foot into the lounge I saw where David was arrested and it came flooding back to me and I couldn\\'t deal with it, I walked outside and took a breather. I realised that I had just ruined someone\\'s life and shattered another... Logan then came outside and saw me sitting on the floor with my back against the wall, he looked concerned but he shouldn\\'t be I mean after all the only reason David got arrested was because I told the police everything... L- what\\'s up Jake?... J- ... L- please tell me Jake... J- ... L- Jake?... J- what?... L- what\\'s up?... J- I just realised that I ruined David\\'s life and shattered Moms, she loved him and then her fucking son just took the person she loved away from her! L- she chose that dickhead over your well-being, I think you had a right to... J- it don\\'t feel good at all... I heard Logan sigh and I looked him in the eyes, he looked at me and smiled. I smiled and then leaned my head on his shoulder, I couldn\\'t believe how understanding he was being... J- when can we move to LA? I wanna be there as soon as possible!... L- that\\'s the thing, when do you wanna go?... J- before graduation, like 2 days before it so then we won\\'t have to wait long for people... L- that\\'s fine, I\\'ll set it all up. I have a place in LA that Mark is keeping for us so we wouldn\\'t lose it... I nodded and shut my eyes, I\\'m so happy. I was gonna drop out after the matches and then focus on vlogging, making Team 10 a business and making money. We then went back inside and chilled but then our Mom finally came home! JL- MOM!... P: save it boys... J- Where were you?! We were worried! P: there\\'s no need to be! I\\'m fine L- you aren\\'t fine mom! And we won\\'t stop bugging you until you tell us! P: FINE! I was thinking about mine and David\\'s relationship and I realised that I chose that bastard who did so much to you, Jake, then my own sons! So I was filling out a divorce... I smiled and hugged her, Logan joined and soon enough we had our Mom back! Lillie, Kane and Noah then came down the stairs and were laughing, just then Erika\\'s Mom, Dad and siblings arrived and came for dinner. I had completely forgot that Mom invited them over and Romans family stayed as well. We were all sitting in the dining room, eating, when Logan made an announcement... L- okay, so me and Jake are moving up to LA!... Angel: ERIKA IS TOO! J- for modelling right?... Dan- yep! Rik: who knows, we might see each other... I chocked on my food, I completely forgot that I wanted to talk to her about Team 10... J- Erika, what would you think if I wanted to turn Team 10 into a business?... Rik: that it would be an amazing idea! J- me and Nick were talking about it last night, he thinks it would be a good idea to turn it into like a group of social media influencers. Rik: that\\'s awesome, so that\\'s what you meant when you said you were thinking about the teams future! J- I had to see what you were doing first because then if we were going up to LA maybe I could fly the others out once college is finished... P: I never knew that Business interested you Jake! J- it\\'s really cool, like it\\'s an amazing idea with business. It helps you create opportunities like this one, I took the opportunity to go to LA with Logan and me and the Team can benefit from it! It\\'s a win, win type of scenario. Roman- yeah it\\'s like with clothing, say you make a certain type of clothing you would want a brand deal right? J- absolutely! You would also want to market it/ pitch it to see if it is good enough! Everyone except Roman and Jake- Why are you guys so smart?! J- for starters you just called me smart when really I just pay attention in business! Roman- and I have a clothing line so I understand where he\\'s coming from! Kane- what are you guys talking about? J- something that involves making money! Something that my teachers here never taught me! L- I swear to god, the next time you foreshadow your new song I\\'m gonna slap you! Rik: he will block it Logan! J- she tried slapping me last night and I blocked it! Rik: he called me... J- *coughs* Mickey *coughs* DaniJC- stop flirting, we\\'re trying to eat! We all laughed and finished eating before relaxing by the pool, Lillie was sitting on my lap and was dipping her feet inside the pool like me. I got this phone call and it was from Nick, I answered it and he sounded ecstatic! On call- J- Nick? What\\'s up bro? Nick- guess who just created the first ever social media group ever! J- are you serious right now? That\\'s awesome Nick! Nick- you managed to talk to Erika? J- yep, she\\'s on board! Nick- so are the others! So it looks like you Jake Paul have your very own business! J- dude! That\\'s awesome like I\\'m so happy that you managed to do that! Nick- I managed to convince Erika to help me with business but she\\'s still on the team. J- that\\'s completely fine, thanks nick! Nick- also once you move up to LA I have a house waiting for you and we managed to help Logan out as well! J- that\\'s lit! Thanks for the hookup man! Nick- don\\'t say that out loud if your girlfriends there! J- I\\'ll explain it to her don\\'t worry! Nick- bye Jake! J- bye nick! End off call... I was smiling so much and whilst I was on the phone me and Erika made eye contact so I wiggled my eyebrows and she giggled, man her giggle was so cute! I ended the call and explained to everyone what Nick was saying! J- Guess who\\'s got a business then?! Rik: someone\\'s making moves! L- that\\'s awesome Jake! Also did Nick tell you he\\'s helping me until we both grow? J- yep! He\\'s also set us up with a house in LA and like everyone else is on board! This is amazing! Rik: well now that you have YouTube going you\\'ll really expand your areas right? J- yeah, I can get sponsored for a video and like make moves so we can all benefit from it! Gr- looks like our boys are growing up Pam! P: *laughs* you got that right! I still can\\'t get over the fact that business interests you Jake! J- I\\'ve always like the concept of having my own business and now that I get the chance to I\\'ll gladly take it! Rik: now Jake, you have to behave in school still! J- yes mom! Rik: You called me the mom of the group in your video! LJ- you are! Te: TRICKY RIK! Rik: TESSA BROOKS! J- LITTLE SIS Te: BIG BRO! We laughed and hugged them she came and sat down and the team then took Lillie off of my lap and threw me in the pool, Tessa pushed Erika in and everyone was laughing. I swam over to Erika and kissed her, we pulled away and went back to where we were sitting. J- why does this feel like a scene from Camp Rock? Rik: I feel it to! X- same! Jake: So let\\'s sing Na Na Na Na Na Hey, ya Come on And sing Na Na Na Na Na Hey, Ya Erika and Jake: This is our song That\\'s all that matters \\'Cause we all belong Right here together There\\'s nothing better Then singing along This is our summer This is our song Troy and Gabriella: Come grab your guitar Sit by the fire \\'Cause we all need a song When we\\'re weary and tired Jake and Erika: We\\'ll sit here Together And sing it out loud Everyone: This is our song That\\'s all that matters \\'Cause we all belong Right here together There\\'s nothing better Then singing along This is our summer And this is our song This is our song This is our song This is our song Jake: Come on and sing Na Na Na Na Na Hey, ya Guys join in: Come on and sing Na Na Na Na Na Hey, ya Girls join in: And come on and sing Na Na Na Na Na Hey, ya Everyone: Come on and sing Na Na Na Na Na Hey, ya Jake: Yeah Everyone: This is our song That\\'s all that matters \\'Cause we all belong Right here together There\\'s nothing better Then singing along This is our summer Jake: our summer Everyone: This is our song That\\'s all that matters \\'Cause we all belong Right here together There\\'s nothing better Then singing along This is our summer This is our song Erika: this is our song Everyone: This is our song Erika: this is our song Everyone: This is our song Erika: this is our song Jake: this is our song! Everyone clapped and I smiled, I knew that I never wanted these people to leave my life as they had shaped me to become the person I was now but I knew that I would have to say goodbye eventually. I had an idea and I knew that everyone would be on board. L- Jake?... J- ... L- Jake?... J- huh? What?... L- wanna play truth or dare? J- sure! L- Troy, Truth or Dare! T- dare! L- well this is gonna be aimed at all the guys— Guys- ughhhhhhh... L- but when you guys win you all have to sing What we came here for from Camp Rock! J- YOU STOLE MY IDEA *laughing* L- what?... J- that\\'s why I was like zoned out, that was my idea *still laughing* T- Logan, Truth or Dare? L- dare! T- I dare you to sing it with us! L- fine! ChAJ- KARMAS AN IDIOT! We all laughed and were joking around with each other, i had to tell everyone that I was thinking of dropping out after the matches and Erika could see that something was bothering me. Rik: Jake? What\\'s up?... J- errrrrr... Rik: Jake?... J- after the matches I was thinking of dropping out of high school... Rik: what why? J- well that\\'s if all the hate I got from your post continues... Rik: you saw that?... J- I read every single comment... Rik: are you sure?... J- I need to think about it more before I have a final decision... P: you are not dropping out Jake! You\\'ve worked to hard and anyway why would you wanna miss your graduation?... J- I dunno... like I said I need to think about it more... Brad- whatever choice you make Jake we are all supporting you! J- thanks! We all relaxed and I leaned back and shut my eyes, I loved life but I knew that it could change in a heart beat... I didn\\'t feel comfortable for some strange reason, it was like something bad was gonna happen. Not to me but to someone really close to me, everyone had left and we were all getting ready to sleep when suddenly my mom got a phone call and told us to head to the hospital? I was so confused but we all headed there and that\\'s when I realised that my suspicion was right, I saw Lillie and my auntie just not my dad. A nurse walked over to us and explained what happened and it broke my heart, our dad had a heart attack and they had no idea if he would live... I wanted to tell Erika but I didn\\'t wanna wake her up, mom tried sending me and Logan home but we wanted to stay because of Lillie. She was asleep and Logan decided to take her back to the house but I refused to leave Dad, incase anything happened I wanted to say goodbye to my dad before he went... My phone then started vibrating a lot, i checked who it was and it was Erika. I walked outside and answered it, she sounded really tired... On call: Rik: hey, I was just wondering if you wanted to go on a date soon? J- uh s-sure!... Rik: Jake what\\'s wrong?... J- errrr... E-Erik-ka... Rik: Jake, send me your location I\\'m coming and you\\'re staying with me! J- ummmm... I-I... Rik: Jake! Please talk to me, I\\'m walking downstairs right now. You aren\\'t stopping me! J- I don\\'t wanna talk about it *sniffles* Rik: are you crying?... J- yep... Rik: Jake, please... J- it\\'s fine Rik, just stuff that I\\'ll take care of. Go to bed you sound exhausted! Rik: you sound like you\\'re crying and need his girlfriend so now we\\'re even!... J- okay, whatever... Rik: Jake please send me your location... J-... Rik: Jake?... End of call. I didn\\'t even realise that I had started crying until I looked at myself through my camera screen, I cleaned my face up and walked back inside. My mom stared at me but I shrugged her off and sat down, Erika kept on trying to call me as did Logan and Chanthony. I ignored them all and soon I had the entire gang trying to call me, I let my phone ring because I didn\\'t wanna talk to anyone. If I did then I would break down and it would be the worst! Soon afterwards Anthony\\'s dad was on the phone to my mom and then they set up for everyone to meet at my house and that\\'s when my mom forced me to go and I finally gave in. I arrived there after everyone and Logan I\\'m guessing had to deal with it considering the house was unlocked when I arrived, as soon as I walked through that door Erika was right there holding me and was by my side. I kissed the top of her head and walked into where everyone was, they all looked at me sympathetically and I sat down. I put my head in my hands and sat like that until Erika came over and sat next to me, she whispered something into my ear, which yet again I didn\\'t understand, and I leaned back and folded my arms. Everyone tried talking to me but I just ignored them and kept myself in my own little head space, they all wanted to know what happened and then Logan came down the stairs and saw me. He sighed and I knew that he was about to tell everyone as they all knew was that they had to meet at ours, Logan had tears down his face as he was explaining what had happened to dad. L- basically our dad is in the hospital because of a heart attack and they have no idea if he\\'ll live... I only just realised that Chloe was there so him and Chloe hugged whilst Erika was hugging me around the neck. She pulled my head into her shoulder and kissed the top of my head before playing with my hair. My phone started going off, it took one look at it and turned it off. Erika looked confused but I didn\\'t want her to read that message because of how painful that message was to read, I rested my head on her shoulder and shut my eyes. I kept on thinking, When will this nightmare finally be over? Surprisingly the girls didn\\'t put on Pitch Perfect but instead they put on \\'Rome\\' one of my favourite songs. I smiled and it made Erika smile, she then got up and started singing it. The entire time she was I filmed it and was laughing or smiling, once the song ended she replayed it and me and Troy started jamming out to it. This time it was the other way around so the girls filmed it etc... Jake: Memories All the times that came and went Troy: came and went Put me in a place of innocence Troy: of innocence Now I\\'m looking back With no regrets Troy: no regrets Oh- Oh- Oh- Oh Guilty- ish pleasures On the speakers in my room Troy: coming through the speakers You were there to keep my secrets too Troy: keep my secrets too Just like I was your confession booth Both: How young confessions make Life-still impressions I know that I never paid attention To most of the many subtleties I know that I never failed to mention That the chemistry wasn\\'t hard to see And now when I look in your direction Something new washes over me I hate that I\\'m in it for collection Tick- Tick- Tick- Tick Oh- Oh- Oh I feel like I woke up in Rome But my surrounding are the same It\\'s the perspective and my mind That\\'s different I feel like I woke up in Rome The world around me is the same But the feelings in my heart are Changing Jake: And now it\\'s easier to read between These lines And find the signs Sometimes I dig so deep I hit the walls in the back of my mind And now I see so obviously Like a bright flash on a Big-screen TV Somethings aren\\'t so quick to build Do I dive in or is it too soon? Both: I know that I never paid attention To most of the many subtleties I know that I never failed to mention That the chemistry wasn\\'t hard to see And now when I look in your direction Something new washes over me I hate that I\\'m in it for collection Tick- Tick- Tick- Tick Oh- Oh- Oh I feel like I woke up in Rome But my surroundings are the same It\\'s the perspective and my mind that\\'s different I feel like I woke up in Rome The world around me is the same But the feelings in my heart are changing I feel like I woke up in Rome (feel like I woke up in Rome) (woke up in Rome) I feel like I woke up in Rome (woke up in Rome) But my surroundings are the same It\\'s the perspective and my mind that\\'s different (perspective and my mind) I feel like I woke up in Rome (I woke up in Rome) The world around me is the same But the feelings in my heart are changing (feelings in my heart) But the feelings in my heart are changing (x2) It was so funny singing and dancing like weirdos with Troy like I had completely forgot about what had happened with my dad, my phone was exploding. I looked at every single message and I sighed, I fucking hated how much hate I got! I needed to address everything to the camera because I felt as if it was a safer way to do so, Me, Nick and Erika all walked outside so I could talk to the camera and seeing as it was my dad\\'s old one if anything happened to me I would give it to him. J- okay Jake Paulers, and yes nick gave you that name. I need to talk to you guys about stuff, basically I have been in a very crucial/ rough time you could say. My dad had been recently admitted to the hospital from a heart attack, the doctors have no idea if he\\'d live but I\\'m literally praying he does. *wipes tears from eyes* sorry about that guys... anyway and I\\'ve been getting a lot of hate because I dunno and like people are telling me to go kill myself and etc, like if you hate me ignore me because no one should have to deal with it, I can\\'t say anything cause I\\'ve had a past of bullying people but I\\'ve stopped that. And basically I\\'m gonna read some of the hate I\\'m getting... Nick- by the way this is not okay like we know Jakes done it but like there were something\\'s going on in his life that he couldn\\'t control and therefore he couldn\\'t control how he acted at school. Like if you don\\'t like someone ignore them not make something really small spiral out of proportion... Rik: like it\\'s not nice to bully people! Like it\\'s not fair, no ones perfect so mistakes will be made along the way! J- this is gonna give me so much more hate like it\\'s actually funny how much more I\\'m gonna get... Anyway, I won\\'t say the names but I\\'m just gonna read them out... 1) go cut yourself 2) you don\\'t deserve to be here 3) it should be you battling between life and death not your dad... *crying* Rik: how would people know about that?... *whispered to Jake* Nick- okay that\\'s crossed the f*cking line! J- this is probably the worst day of my life *laughing/ crying* ever... We turned the camera off and sat in a comfortable silence, Erika was holding me and I was trembling. Maybe they were all right? Maybe I don\\'t deserve to be here, maybe my dad shouldn\\'t be the one battling between life and death, instead it should be me... Nick went inside and then looked really conflicted... we both walked in afterwards and we had to explain what was up as I was still crying but I didn\\'t bother wiping my face... Nick- okay, all the hate Jakes getting just crossed the line! Rik: everyone knows about what happened to his dad and they took it upon themselves to say \"it should be you battling between Life and Death, not your dad\" T- that\\'s messed up! J- maybe they are all fucking right!? Ever thought about that?! I walked straight up to the island in the kitchen and rested my elbows on it, I had my head in my hands and was still crying. L- jake... *sniffling* J- ... L- why do you believe that?... J- EVERYONES FUCKING SAID IT TO ME LOGAN! WHY SHOULDNT I, I\\'VE HEARD IT MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE!... At this point I was pissed, I couldn\\'t control it. I let out the banshee. I was shaking and had stopped crying, I couldn\\'t control the anger that had escaped. My breathing had increased and my shaking had gotten worse, I could remember myself shouting at Logan until Chance stood in front of me and hugged me, Anthony then joined in and they both had tears in their eyes. I was shaking too much and I could tell that they both had started crying, I pulled away and wiped my face. Chance then pulled me close to his chest and held me, it was around 7:30 am when everyone left (minus Erika, Chanthony, Crystal and Brad) Logan was asleep with Lillie as she had woken up to my yelling, I didn\\'t wanna face anyone but I knew that I would have to. Chance and Anthony were on either side of me trying to talk to me but I just stayed silent, after that little break down I couldn\\'t deal with anyone or even life for that matter. Erika was talking with Crystal and Brad because I could hear them and this were talking about me. My mom finally came home at around 10 am and everyone left, I stayed on the couch and my mom came and sat next to me. I leaned my head on her shoulder and shut my eyes, I hadn\\'t slept that entire night and I was exhausted. P: your dad woke up... J- I need to see him, like I can\\'t live rn! P: Jake?... J- if it weren\\'t for Chance and Tony then I would have killed myself...'][Chapter 14] ['Troy\\'s PoV: It was finally game day! Basketball was first then tomorrow was soccer and then the day after that was football. Jake had been on the edge of a full on break down ever since his little emotional break down, he\\'s stopped talking to anyone and it\\'s honestly really hard to see him like that. I remembered that if we won that me, Erika, Gabriella, Jake, Logan, Chanthony, Jason, Tessa, Nelly, Chaylor, Zarpay, Martha, Kelsi, Ryan, Chad T, Alex, Mackenzie, Kade and Emilio and Ivan Martinez all had to sing What we came here for, I hated that dare but I would never back out of a dare. Actually we all made a compromise that we would do it in the half time slot because the cheerleaders didn\\'t have a routine, so that meant we were the entertainment, great... We all arrived at Jakes and he was wearing his jersey with Chanthony, they had all made the team and it was a great advantage point. Minus today and these next two days as they knew their weaknesses. We left Jakes and all met at WestLake, we were all chilling in the gym when the basketball team started getting into Jakes head and he looked like he was about to implode. T- leave him the hell alone! ???- or what? Why are you backing this snitch up anyway! He\\'s a little snake, watch your backs and that\\'s a protection warning... They walked away and Jake leaned back, he was clearly done with this. T- just ignore them, they are the snakes! J- thanks man... T- what are friends for?... I saw him smile and we spent the rest of the time talking to each other and I learned a lot more then what I bargained for. I fount out that he\\'s attempted twice in his life and that Logan fucked his girlfriend causing for everyone to call him a snake. It didn\\'t really make sense but that\\'s how it was, he\\'s had such a rough life and I think that breakdown was him showing what he\\'s feeling. J- you know when I had that incident... T- yeah?... J- if it weren\\'t for Chance and Tony I would have ended it then and there not caring who saw and all that... I was shocked, basically Chance and Tony stopped him from suicide?... I didn\\'t want to talk to him about that incase i made it worse, we hugged and then started practise. Chanthony hadn\\'t arrived yet and everyone was wondering to where they were, once they arrived they grim expressions all over their faces. J- guys?... A- umm, Jake we were at the hospital. Your mom called us... J- the only person I know who\\'s in the hospital is... omg... is- is he good?... A- he- he slipped into a coma... T- nahhhhh, I thought he was awake?... ChJA- same... A- sorry dude... J- nahh, it\\'s fine. I\\'ll see him later... Ch- you sure you good?... J- yep... We finished practise and had spare time until the other team had to practise, we were all changing and Jake hadn\\'t said anything ever since his dad was put in the coma. Jake was on his phone when it started blowing up, everyone knew that this was the hate and he read every single message and had the same emotion all the way through. J- I want this shit to end before I end it... Ch- stop thinking about that!... A- if you think about that literally we will not stop being on your case until you stop thinking like that!... J- you won\\'t do shit guys!... T- people can be dickheads, they get to you, they win... J- literally like the next person who says anything about my dad and me I will literally kms... Chanthony- then we won\\'t leave your side! Even to use the bathroom!... J- ewww... Ja- what happens if he needs a number two?... Z- I think we should leave it as that you have loyal friends Jake before it gets out of hand... T- I agree with that! Everyone laughed and we finished changing, we all left and I could Jake was feeling like the weight of the world was rested on his shoulders. T- you sure you\\'re okay?... J- nope... T- you ever need to talk, we are here for you! J- thanks now let\\'s go make our girlfriends smell like sweaty guys! T- I\\'m down!... We came up behind the girls and grabbed them around the waist, they both screamed and then complained that they smelt like boys. We laughed and kissed them, they ordered us to take showers but we already did and Erika knew how faulty the showers were apparently. J- hey, Rik. We need to talk, like now!... Jakes PoV: I pulled Erika aside and was going to tell her about my dad because I wanted to talk to her about it and not keep her in the dark. She looked confused but once she saw that \"upset\" look on my face she eased up and was immediately concerned. Rik: Jake? What happened?... J- Chanthony told me that my dad\\'s been put in a coma... Rik: OMG... are you okay? Like emotionally because you haven\\'t been yourself in months! *holds Jakes hand* J- I-I dunno, like this hate thing has really made me question A LOT of things that made me do stupid things in my past so what happens if I make them stuff again?... Rik: you won\\'t don\\'t worry, I can see that this is what your dad meant when he said that he could see anxiety *holding both of Jakes hands* J- you know about me passing out then?... Rik: yep, and I know the amount of stress you\\'re putting yourself under. Jake it\\'s really not healthy, maybe you should take a couple days off to be human again... *kisses Jakes cheek* J- what did I do to deserve someone as amazing like you?... *puts hands around her waist* Rik: no, it\\'s me who doesn\\'t deserve you *puts hands around his neck and leans in* J- this is why I love you Erika Costell... *leans in, foreheads touching* Rik: I love you too, Jake Joseph Paul... kisses Jake* I kissed back and we pulled away for air, we both got cuddled up and walked over to Troy and Gabriella. Just then Chalex, Tanthony, McKade, Chlogan, Chessa (Chad and Tessa), Chaylor, Nelly, Martinez Twins, Jartha and Relsi walked over and then Tessa said something adorable... Te: and here comes the cutest couple!... Jerika- *blushing* you and Tony are a cute couple! We looked at each other and started laughing. Jerika- STOP IT! Jerika- NO YOU STOP IT! Tanthony: COUPLE GOALS! Tanthony: we\\'ve got it now! *laughing* Jerika- COUPLE GOALS SUCKERS! Jerika- UGHHHHH! Chalex- now that was cute! Troyella: THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY FUNNY! Chaylor- EVERYONE SHUT UP BEFORE I LITERALLY LOSE MY MIND! We all bursted out into laugher and soon enough the football team came back... Dave- too bad that we didn\\'t do worse to you boys! T- shut the hell up! You couldn\\'t do worse even if you tried! Dave- pipe down before I put you in the hospital! G: don\\'t talk to my boyfriend like that! Dave- I\\'ll talk to him however the fuck I want hottie! C- what do you guys want?! ???- to watch our basketball team beat your asses! J- your teams fucking shit! The only good player was Tony and now he plays for the wildcats! I say put your money where your mouth is... Dave then came up to me and yanked me up, he squared up in my face and I did the same. Everyone else was either filming it or trying to get in the middle of it. Dave- it should be you in that coma not your dad, you should be the one who might die not your dad. You should be the one who tried to commit! You should be the person who gives up on life! I was livid, he was talking about my dad and it like ignited a spark inside and I didn\\'t know how to control it... I punched him square in the face and he got me right on the ribs, I then continued to throw punches at him and he did the same until we both got pulled back. (PE= Principal Elks) PE- WHATS GOING ON HERE?! J- let me fucking kill him! I literally don\\'t wanna see him near me anymore before I kill him... Ch- No your not, we aren\\'t letting you kill him! A- it\\'s over our dead bodies Jake! J- this is absolute bull shit! T- Jake, listen to them. He\\'s done enough damage, remember the last time you fought him... PE- JAKE, CHANTHONY, ERIKA AND TESSA AND ALEX. MY OFFICE NOW!... J- WHAT ABOUT DAVE?! PE- he didn\\'t do anything wrong! J- are you being fucking serious right now? SOMEONE KILL ME NOW IF HE GETS TO GET AWAY WITH THIS SHIT! Ch- you weren\\'t there, Principal Elks! A- You didn\\'t hear what he was saying! PE- I know my students and I know that they would never do such thing! I walked straight out of Chances grip and walked away from them all, I went to my old locker and punched it. It took about 5 hits before my knuckle started bleeding and another 15 before the locker was completely trashed, no one could find me so I walked into the nearest washroom and cleaned up my hand. My phone started going off and I knew that it was either Erika or the people giving me hate, I checked it and surprisingly it wasn\\'t either. It was Logan, I read his text but didn\\'t reply. I was on the edge of punching the glass and cutting then and there but then a picture of Erika popped into my head and I couldn\\'t bring myself to do it. I sighed and threw cold water at my face, Dave then came in and we went for round two. By the end of the fight the mirrors had been smashed completely and there was glass all in our skin and etc. It\\'s safe to say that by the end of the fight we were both injured pretty badly, I pulled my phone out and looked at myself through the camera as the mirrors were smashed completely, I mean I knew that Dave was ugly just not that ugly, Jesus. My nose was completely broken, I had a slight black eye, pretty much my entire face was bleeding, my knuckles were both broken and don\\'t even get me started on the glass that went everywhere! My ankle had been messed up and to think I had to play a match later today! I sighed and grabbed some tissue, Dave had left because his \"goons\" took him somewhere and I was quite frankly glad. My head was banging and I knew that I was going in and out of consciousness. I stood up after sitting on the toilet because I felt really light headed, and I headed to class. When I walked in late and saw everyone looking at me concerned I smiled and sat down, ignoring the pain radiating through my body and nose. My table went, Me, Erika, Chance, Alex, Tony and Tessa. Every now and again I would wince in pain but I ignored the concerned looks they gave me. When the teacher walked outside Erika was trying to talk to me, she could see that my face was cut and that my knuckles were broken. Rik: Jake? What happened?... J- me and Dave went for round two, it\\'s safe to say that a restroom needs new mirrors and needs to clean the floor... Rik: ewwwwwww *gagging* J- I know, Dave broke my nose completely! A- bro! What exactly happened? J- me and Dave went for round two! Ch- what?! A- you don\\'t look good bro... J- it\\'s *winces in pain* f-fine... Al: when it\\'s lunch we are taking you to the nurse to get checked out! J- fine, whatever... A- who won?... J- me, I almost broke his arm but I let him go and he ran off. I went dead silent and clutched my ribs, I was fairly sure that he had broken my ribs... Rik: are you sure that you\\'re okay?... J- n-nope *winces in pain* Te: we are taking you to go get checked up! You look really pale... J- it\\'s fine, really *whispered* I had one hand holding my head and the other on my side, I was in too much pain to speak after that and my head was still messing with me like say one minute I could see everything the next it would be pitch black. I shut my eyes, before I knew it I had to throw up... I ran straight out the class and to the restroom to throw up, Chance and Tony case after me and when they arrived they saw me leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. Ch- come with us, we\\'re taking you to the nurse... J- fine, whatever *weak and whispered* I leaned against Tony and then we arrived at medical they came through with me and Tony message Tessa saying that they were with me in medical. The rest after this was a blur because I think I properly went unconscious and after that I woke up in a white room. I was being blinded by this light and I wanted to turn it off but I couldn\\'t, just then Chance came into view and I couldn\\'t make out what he was saying. He then looked over at me and smiled, he knew I was awake then. Ch- looks like you got some company boner Toner. A- A) stop calling me that and B) is he awake *whispered* Chance nodded and Tony then got up and walked to the bed, he sat on the left side of me and tried filling me on what happened but I was having a little bit of difficulty understanding what he was saying. J- I literally cant hear you and yeah but what about the match?... A- been postponed until after the football match... J- I\\'m sorry dude... A- it\\'s not your fault, once Coach spoke to the school board he managed to change the dates considering that one of their players injured one of ours... J- okay... A- how do you feel?... J- like I got ran over by a truck and then it backed up and did it all over again... A- sorry bro... J- do the others know I\\'m here?... A- we didn\\'t tell them because they said that they might be able to discharge you today... J- ahh okay... A- they all think that you got sent home and that we\\'re with you *chuckles* I smiled and closed my eyes, and with that I fell asleep. It was around 1 pm when they discharged me and we chilled at mine until everyone else got there, I was sleeping in my room and then Erika came and woke me up on accident. Rik: sorry, I didn\\'t mean to wake you up... *whispered* J- nahh it\\'s fine *tiredly and whispered* She came over and kissed me on the cheek and I fell back asleep, I heard her shut my door and after that I didn\\'t hear anything. It had been an hour since I saw Erika and I had just woken up, I walked downstairs, well more like limped, and saw everyone there. I heard this singing coming from the backyard so we all went outside and saw that the girls were singing \"Little Me\" from Little Mix. We all clapped once they finished and they all look startled, I smiled and Erika came up to me and held my hand. Rik: hey... J- hey... Rik: how are you feeling?.. J- better then I was earlier, you could say... Rik: awww baby *grabs both hands and locks fingers with them* J- it\\'s fine... Rik: Dave wasn\\'t in school after that... J- really?... Rik: he wasn\\'t... J- wow... Rik: you slept for ages! You really needed it huh?... J- I guess so... *shrugs* Rik: coach managed to put the match back on for later today... X except Erika- really?... J- the doctor said I could play! Chanthony- yep! X except JChA- WHAT?... Rik: Jake!... J- surprise?... basically I passed out in medical and woke up in the hospital... Ja- you literally have a tendency of passing out at school *laughs slightly* JChA- and for getting into fights with Dave! *laughing* I checked the time, CRAP! It was time for rehearsals! A- yo, we gotta bounce! Ja- why? J- we\\'ve got show rehearsals... Ch- we\\'ll try and get you guys to watch it if you want? X- we don\\'t mind... I called the rehearsal person and they let them watch as long as they didn\\'t say anything to anyone else. We actually managed to add them to the show which was awesome! We all chilled back at mine until Coach walked in looking frantic. T- you good dad? C.B- the match is back on for tonight well it will be only if we have a player... J- I can play coach, Chanthony was there when I got the all clear! C.B- are you sure? I don\\'t wanna put you out there if you\\'re still injured... J- it\\'s fine, anything bad happens Chance and Tony got me... C.B- if you\\'re sure then looks like the match is back on... X- WOOOHOOOO! J- THAT MEANS WE STILL HAVE TO DO LOGANS DARE... Rik: well we\\'ll do it with you guys... X- really?... Girls: yep! C.B- I don\\'t even wanna know *laughing* T- Logan\\'s doing it with us! *laughing* J- LOGAN *shouts* He came sprinting down the stairs and looks like he hadn\\'t been told that the match was back on. JT- Match is back on! L- CRAP THE DARE! We all laughed and headed down to the school again, once we got there everyone was shocked to see me and that the match was still on but who cares anyway?... we got all set up and the match started, each time I got the ball they would do football tackles and it would flip me upside down. The referee didn\\'t do anything because he was on WestLakes side whereas he would always give me the fouls and like they would all take it. It was halftime and I could barely hear myself think it was that loud and then we all walked out into the middle and Logan put the song on but announced that what they were about to witness was a dare. Jake: They say that life is a Two- way street When you\\'re not sure You gotta trust your feet To know that right way Erika: You can keep on moving With your head down Or you can stop and Take a look around And that\\'s the choice I\\'ve made Jerika: It\\'s for that movie Inside your head Making memories We can\\'t forget And when you can\\'t forget Everyone: You\\'re gonna know I\\'m your soul That this is what we came here for So live it loud Here and now This moment It won\\'t be ignored So why not open up that door? It\\'s what we came here for Gabriella: For every song we let play Outside The melodies begin to write Every time we sing Troy: Friends we\\'ve made Fun we\\'ve had Memories gonna make me laugh It\\'s a beautiful thing Gabriella: so beautiful Troyella: I want to say it around the world \\'Cause everyone should feel like good \\'Cause when you feel this good Everyone: You\\'re gonna know In your soul That this it what we came here for So live it loud Here and now This moment it won\\'t be ignored So why not open up that door? It\\'s what we came here for Jerika: No The fund just getting started Celebrating where we are Loving where we are Everyone: You\\'re gonna know In your soul This is what we came here for So live it loud Here and now This moment it won\\'t be ignored You\\'re gonna know In your soul This is what we came here for So live it loud Here and now So why not open up that door So why not open up that door It\\'s what we came here Oh yeah Came here for That\\'s what we came here Came here for Everyone clapped and we were all laughing our heads off, we couldn\\'t believe that we just did that. We then walked off and relaxed before having to play the second half (this is based off of how soccer is because I don\\'t know anything about basketball, well not well enough) we won the game with a score of 99-65 it was safe to say that they put up a fight. We all came back to my house and I was busy icing my head, shoulder and ankle as it was getting worse with each passing minute. Ch- dude, you look dead! J- thanks for that! C.B- they targeted you, why? T- earlier today they were calling him a snake and that he\\'s a snitch, they literally gave us a protection warning. J- Troy stuck up for me cause like if I started talking to them I probably wouldn\\'t have backed down... My ankle was killing me, I had hopped all the way to the changing rooms after walking off of the court and just couldn\\'t walk at all. I limped my way to the couch and sat down, still icing my ankle. A- how bad is your ankle bro?... J- if I can\\'t walk on it then probably quite bad Toner. Ch- *coughs* boner Toner *coughs* A- shut it ice age squirrel! I still have access to basketballs! T- THATS WHO HE REMINDS ME OF! Literally the first day we met I knew he looked familiar! *laughing* Ch- you and Zac Efron might as well be related man! You look exactly like him! T- NO I DONT! Rik: boys! Calm down, I\\'ve slapped Jake once and it left a red mark on his face for a week, don\\'t make me slap you guys as well! X- yes mom *mumbled* Rik: morons... J- LEAVE US ALONE MICKEY! Rik: that\\'s it!... Erika started chasing me but then I picked her up and threw her over my shoulder. J- who\\'s the greatest?... Rik: JAKE PAUL IS MY DAD!... J- actually I\\'m your bf! I started tickling her and soon enough I gave up because she said that I was the greatest. We kissed and I sat back down, I was smiling because she was laughing and walked outside. I checked my phone and I checked my instagram, I was tagged in this photo and it actually made me laugh it was that pathetic. J- people just don\\'t give up do they? X- what do you mean? J- some people man... another person, literally kill me now! Idfc that I should be where my dad is! It\\'s unnecessary!... ughhhhhh *rolls eyes* C.B- Jake what\\'s wrong? J- people are being actual little melts like it\\'s too pathetic! T- Jake?... J- ughhhhh, I\\'m actually about to give up man I hate this!... I threw my phone across the room and sigh deeply, not only do I need a new phone but I need new people in my life! A- let me go get that Jake... He went and got my phone, he gave it back to me and I was tempted to throw it across the room again but I was intrigued because someone had got hold of my number and I wanted to know what they wanted. Ch- how is that not broken?... A- dunno... *shrugs* J- THIS IS IT, IM ACTUALLY FUCKING DONE WITH LIFE! *shouts* C.B- Jake? What\\'s going on?... J- FUCKING PEOPLE MAN! *triggered* I wanted to throw my phone across the room but I didn\\'t, instead I walked (limped) my way outside and sat down on the edge of the pool. I was contemplating whether I should be here at all, Erika then walked outside and sat down next to me. She was rubbing circles into my shoulder with her thumb and we sat in a comfortable silence, she then wanted to talk to me... fuck my life... Rik: Jake?... J- ... Rik: what\\'s wrong?... J- people are right, maybe I don\\'t deserve to be here and maybe if I die then there will be more space for other people! Maybe I should just end it!... Rik: j-jake... *crying* J- what? It\\'s the truth and don\\'t even deny it *starting to cry, wipes away tears from eyes* Rik: no it\\'s not Jake! I don\\'t want to lose you because I know that one day I want to marry you and that I want to start a family with you! I was in love with you when we first met, and I still am now. I LOVE YOU JAKE JOSEPH PAUL! I would not know what to do if you died!... *full on crying* J- you would be living your life as a model and be very successful! You would have the man if your dreams with you and your children... E-Erika I don\\'t think that man can be me if I don\\'t wanna be here anymore... *crying* Rik: please don\\'t jake... please, please don\\'t... I love you too much to see you vanish from this earth... *crying* J- e-Erika, I don\\'t think I can live here anymore. I can\\'t be here if I keep on getting told to disappear!... *crying even more* Rik: Jake, please don\\'t do it! What about everyone! Your mom!— J- chose her abusive husband over me and Logan *sternly* Rik: what about Logan? J- he\\'s got Chloe and he\\'s not like he\\'s around as it is anyway!... *emotionless* Rik: w-what about me Jake? What am I going to do because I know that I won\\'t be having that life you said I would! *crying her eyes out* J- you would be living your life! Forgetting about all this drama and moving on in your life! *whispered and crying* Rik: Jake, I would kill my self if you died. Whether it was suicide or not, my life would be nothing without you! Please stay in it *crying* J- Erika, you wouldn\\'t... *whispered* Rik: please! If you love me you won\\'t! *crying, shaking* J- if you love me you\\'ll let me go *crying and whispered*'][Chapter 15] ['Erika\\'s PoV: I was frantically searching for a way to stop Jake from committing, I loved him far too much to see him vanish... I was crying my eyes out for the boy of my dreams, praying that he wouldn\\'t end it. J- if you love me you\\'ll let me go... Rik: Jake, please... I love you too much to let you go! You don\\'t understand! J- you don\\'t understand either! If I don\\'t wanna be here then I don\\'t wanna be here... Rik: Jake, please look at me... He didn\\'t look at me instead he was too focused on the floor so I took it upon myself to make him look at me. I lifted his chin up with two fingers and made him look at me. I saw the boy I had fell in love with, not this tough exterior that he built up, I saw Jake Paul for the first time since we moved to Albuquerque... J- I don\\'t understand why you care... Rik: I care because I love you and don\\'t want anything to happen to you! If you were in this position you would try and talk me out of it... J- but, I really don\\'t wanna be here... Rik: Jake, don\\'t leave me until you have to please! You only live once you\\'ve got to make it count!... Erika: One step closer I\\'m breathing in and out So much pressure I know I\\'m about to take a chance Oh, I\\'m going to have to make a stand Cause when the rhythm comes I feel it in my bones Sink my heart out like I\\'m all alone in my sacred world But people they don\\'t really know They don\\'t really know Cause if I could- I\\'ll make it last forever Even when I know I\\'m gonna lose control And I know I\\'m gonna lose control Whoa-oa-oa-oa And when I hurt It always makes it better And I don\\'t care that I\\'m about to lose control And I know I\\'m gonna lose control Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa, Whoa-oa-oa-oa (x2) Whoa-oa-oa-oa Try hard I\\'m a die hard I\\'m never giving up This ain\\'t a dream, no I ain\\'t sleeping it off Gonna take the risk I\\'m gonna show you I was born for this If I have to I\\'ll fall down on my knees Make you feel my pain and memories And you\\'ll fly away Higher and higher (And soon we\\'ll touch the sky) (Or burn in the fire) Cause if I could- I\\'ll make it last forever Even when I know I\\'m gonna lose control And I know I\\'m gonna lose control Whoa-oa-oa-oa And when I hurt It always makes it better And I don\\'t care that I\\'m about to lose control And I know I\\'m gonna lose control Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa, Whoa-oa-oa-oa (x2) Whoa-oa-oa Jakes PoV: I kissed her after she finished singing, everyone had left by the time we went back inside and that was my \"opportunity\" to end it, i walked straight into my room, locked the door, went into my bathroom and locked that door as well. I could hear vague knocks coming from my bed room door, I didn\\'t open it instead I pulled out the knife I had stored in a safe spot... ️Cutting ahead, skip it if your affected by it️ I grabbed the knife and stared at it, I heard the lock on my door break open and I knew that Erika wasn\\'t that strong and that\\'s when I heard Tony and Chances voices... A- JAKE OPEN UP, NOW! Ch- BRO PLEASE! J- I should just listen to those texts! Everyone would be better off without me! A- NOPE THATS NOT TRUE! ERIKA IS BUSY CRYING HER EYES OUT! J- FOR FUCKS SAKE I TOLD HER NOT TO BE HERE!... They kept on banging on the door but I didn\\'t care, I brought the knife up to my wrist and started cutting. My breathing hitched and then it was silent, I guess I scared Chance and Tony because they started banging frantically on the door. As soon as I sighed they relaxed a little bit but still kept on banging on the door. With each cut I made, red liquid came oozing out of my skin and it spread everywhere. I was lost in my own little world and no one could bring me out of it, my bathroom door lock was much stronger then my bedroom one so I sat in my safe room slicing my skin. I smiled as I saw the masa cure on my wrist and legs, I started cutting on my chest and it gave me the same satisfaction as when I was cutting my arms and legs. I was consumed into my own little world as I sat on my toilet cutting away and I was very happy with how it was going. ️Cutting stopped, read from here if you skipped it️ The door started becoming weak so I hid the knife, cleaned it first, and sat in the toilet still with my head leaned against the wall behind it. The door was soon busted open and Chanthony were both in tears, joined by Erika. I smiled and walked out of it, thankfully it was only us at the house at the moment in time. They sat me on my bed and cleaned me up, the entire time I sat there in silence and they were both still crying. Erika was downstairs because they didn\\'t want her to see me like this, once they finished cleaning me up I leaned against the headboard on my bed and shut my eyes. They sat either side of me and looked at me, concerned, I shrugged them off and continued to think about how close I was but at the same time I didn\\'t want to... A- jake?... *sniffles* J- ... Ch- Jake, please... *wiping tears from his eyes* J- ... A- talk to Erika! Hug her, do whatever but just comfort her. She really needs you... *emotionless* I got up from my bed and walked downstairs to see the love of my life crying her eyes out, she didn\\'t hear me walk down the stairs so I came behind her and held her. She cried into my chest and I kissed the top of her head before she pulled away and looked me up and down. She saw the cuts and had a sad expression, I looked down myself and she kissed me. I kissed back and we both pulled back for air after awhile, I smiled and she smiled as well. Rik: j-jake?... J- y-yeah... Rik: why? Why do this to yourself?... J- that I can\\'t answer because I don\\'t know why I do it... Rik: I\\'m just glad that you\\'re here *starts to cry* I pull her close to me and hug her, she hugs back and that\\'s when I knew that she was going to be okay. It had been an emotional day for us all so we all sat on the couch and watched RomanAtwood because why not, we then switched it to VanossGaming. Me and Erika were cuddled up on the couch when she said, Rik: stay the night round mine, please... J- I will if your parents let me... A- we\\'ll get my dad to cover for you so say you\\'re spending the night with me and if she calls then my dad can explain that we fell asleep because of the match! Rik: and I can convince my parents! J- fine! Chance was not involved in this... *laughs a bit* My phone started going off and when I checked it, I really wanted to cut but it was bad enough I did it on my chest and wrist... Erika looked at what they said, she took my phone and switched it off, I smiled and we finished watching Vanoss Gaming before heading to Erika\\'s. I forgot to grab a hoodie so once I walked in they all saw the cuts on my chest, I could have said that they happened because I got in a fight but I didn\\'t wanna lie because I thought of Angel and Dan as parent figures. Dan- Jake?... Angel: Omg... are you... okay?... Rik: he will be if you stop bombarding him with questions, please, for me and Jake... Dan- of course... Angel: we will... you can spend the night Jake... J- t-thanks... Dan- no problem, just if you \"do it\" at least use protection... J- ewww and okay... Rik: well this isn\\'t awkward... J- nope... Rik: it\\'s the soccer matches tomorrow, right? J- yep... Rik: and then football... J- Chance is on the soccer team with Ryan, Kade, Chad T and more people who\\'s names i don\\'t know or remember... Rik: Wait... KADE AND CHAD T ARE ON THE TEAM! J- yep... Rik: wow! Kenzie and Sunny have their work cut out for them tomorrow then *laughs* J- yep... *laughs slightly* Rik: soooo... J- I\\'m going to explain why I did this because I can trust you guys, I wanna tell you both because I think of you both as \"parents\" so it seems right to tell you guys... They smiled at me and as I was explaining it I started to tear up and Erika noticed. She pulled me close to her and held me as I said the rest, soon enough that \"hug\" became a massive group one which I didn\\'t mind. I had Dan, Angel and Erika in tears as well so that was fun... Dan- I\\'m sorry that you have to deal with this Jake *crying slightly* J- it\\'s fine, it\\'s not your faults. Apparently it\\'s mine for being alive... Rik: don\\'t say that Jake!... please don\\'t make me have to relive that nightmare... *crying* I pulled her close to me and let her cry into my chest, I didn\\'t care if the cuts started hurting. I didn\\'t care about anyone or anything else other then the girl in my arms, I wanted to propose but I didn\\'t know when... I started thinking about doing it after she graduated because I\\'m still dropping out but I decided to stay here until the day after her grad so then I could still go to prom. We were gonna have a massive party at mine and I was gonna take her to our spot and propose, like I said I want to marry her someday... I started singing our song softly and I heard her join in... Jake: When your legs don\\'t work Like they used to before And I can\\'t sweep you off of your Feet Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? Will your eyes still smile From your cheeks And darling I will Be loving you till We\\'re seventy And baby my heart Could still fall as hard at Twenty Three And now I\\'m thinking \\'bout How people fall in love In mysterious ways Maybe just the touch of the hand Oh me i fall in love with you Every single day And I just wanna tell you I am... So honey nowwww Take me into your loving arms! Kiss me under the light of a thousand Stars Place your head on my beating Heart I\\'m thinking out loud Maybe we... found... love Right where we are! Erika: When my hair\\'s over-gone and my Memory fades And the crowds don\\'t remember my name When my hands don\\'t play the strings The same way... hmmm I know you will still love me the same Cause honey your... Soul can never grow... old It\\'s ever green Baby you... smile Forever in my mind and Memory! I\\'m thinking \\'bout How people fall in love in Mysterious ways Maybe it\\'s all part of a plan I\\'ll just keep on making the same Mistakes Hoping that you\\'ll understand... Both: That baby now! (oooooh!) Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand Stars Place your head on my beating heart I\\'m thinking out loud Maybe we found love right where we Are... (Ohh Ohh)... (La La La La La La La)... Baby now... Take me into your loving arms Kiss me under the light of a thousand Stars (oh darling) Place your head on my beating heart... I\\'m thinking out loud Maybe we found love right where we Are And maybe we found love right where We are And we found love right where we are... She pulled away and I wiped the stray tear that fell down onto her cheek, she smiled and I smiled. I took her hands into mine and kissed her, she kissed back and we both pulled away after 30 seconds. Rik: I love you Jake Joseph Paul... you are the reason why I\\'m here! You are this light that keeps me strong... you are my happy place... J- I love you Erika Costell, you are the only reason why I didn\\'t do it. You are the reason I\\'m still going each day no matter how bad it gets, I know that one day I want to marry you and have a family! You are the person who I want to spend the rest of my life with! You are my soulmate... A few tears escaped my eyes and Erika wiped them away, I looked straight into her eyes and saw the women who I wanted to spend my life with. She was the women that didn\\'t let me go no matter how hard I tried making her... we both kissed again and got cuddled up, I completely forgot that Dan and Angel were there and they just awwww\\'d. I blushed a little bit and they starting joking around with me saying that I was embarrassed when I did admit I was a little bit. I kissed the top of her head and then Dani and JC came back and looked shocked, they saw my chest but didn\\'t bring it up because they probably thought that I was crying because of it. Dani: hey... Jake... you okay?... J- yeah I\\'m fine, I don\\'t care if you talk to me about the cuts guys because as long as I have this women in my life *points at Erika* then I\\'ll stop! Everyone except Jake and Erika- awwwwww... I smiled and Erika smiled as well, her, JC and Dani went upstairs and I took the opportunity to ask for their permission to marry their daughter... J- I know that we\\'re in high school and I was thinking that after graduation I would take Erika to our spot and propose?... is that okay with you guys? *whispered* Angel: of course! You have my blessing and I respect your choice to ask us first before you do it, that\\'s a man that my daughter can have! Dan- you have my blessing Jake, you\\'ve made her so happy! When you guys broke up the first time she was heart broken and wouldn\\'t eat but now that you two are back together she\\'s been such a bubbly person, it\\'s nice to see her like that again!... *whispered* I thanked them and went upstairs, they were all watching my vlog and that\\'s when I remembered i hadn\\'t vlogged in awhile so I pulled out the camera and started filming them. Erika looked so cute on camera! J- WHATS UP JAKE PAULERS? I\\'m currently at my girlfriends house and I\\'m gonna go film her and scare her cause why not.. *laughs* I walked into her room and shouted something out and it made her and Dani jump, JC was in on it and was busy laughing with me. Rik: JAKE!! LEGIT AT TIMES I HATE YOU *laughs* J- C\\'mon now Mickey! Rik: really? J- really? *mocks erika* Rik: IM JAKE PAUL AND I HOPE YOUR SMILING, I HOPE YOUR DABBING ON THEM HATERS *mocks Jake* J- I actually like that intro! Rik: ily! J- ily2! *kisses her* JC- this dude... is like an older bro to me, you mess with him you ain\\'t gonna be around much longer! *points camera at himself cause he\\'s filming for jake* J- awww thanks JC!... JC- are you keeping it in there? J- yep! JC- oh god... We turned the camera off and then Dan, Angel and JC announced that they were leaving for the week and took Dani with them which meant we had the house to ourselves. I think it was time that me and Erika did it... I spoke to her about it and she was on the pill anyway but for extra protection I actually used protection. ️Intimate parts up ahead, well read if your over 13 unless your a savage and don\\'t blame me for being scarred for life️ Me and Erika started this really heated make out session which quickly turned into sex. I stuck my hands in her trousers and helped her undo them and she took my top off. I helped her take her shirt off and we took my trousers off, before we actually did it we made sure that I was using protection and then the rest was easy. I helped her take her pants off and she took my boxers off. I then put her on her bed and she was ready, I started kissing her neck (each time asking if she wanted it) she nodded and that\\'s when we did it, she kept on moaning and telling me to go faster so I did. Rik: yesss Jakey... yessss J- are you liking that then baby girl? *sexy voice* Rik: ohhhh yeah... faster jakey... I want this moment to be special... I then started doing it faster and each time I heard her moan made me feel happy somehow... she then gave me a hickey which would be fun to cover up. We did it for another 2 hours before we stopped, we were both breathing frantically and we then both fell asleep. ️end of special scene for now️ It was around 9 pm when we woke up and I saw the girl of my dreams still sleeping and damn she looked sexy. I forgot that I was naked so I took the thing off and got changed into my boxers and fell back asleep. Erika\\'s PoV: It was 6:00 am when my alarm woke me up and I saw Jake was still asleep, I kissed his jawline until he woke up we then kissed and he started stroking my abs. J- Erika... Rik: what?... J- why have you got better abs then me? *voice heavy with sleep* Rik: I don\\'t know *laughs slightly* J- come down with me so I can then make you breakfast! Rik: let me take a shower first but sure! J- okay! After Jake headed downstairs I walked into my bathroom and threw up, I had a terrible headache and felt like shit. After awhile I started feeling better and we left to go to the soccer match, I was dressed in this: (Ignore Tessa) Jakes outfit: We arrived an hour later and met up with everyone, they all immediately noticed the hickey I gave Jake... great... Ch- you love birds had fun last night then... J- what do you mean? A- the hickey... J- are you being serious right now?... X- yep... J- CRAP... Rik: OMG... *blushing* J- fuck! Well today\\'s gonna be fun! L- and why, what\\'s up Jakey?... J- because it\\'s the soccer match! Chloe: Erika? Did you give Jake the hickey on his neck? L- WHAT!!!! J- I\\'m gonna go ahead and remove myself from the conversation... L- no, you\\'re staying Jake and so are you Erika so don\\'t leave either! Everyone else can leave and we\\'ll meet them at the game! Everyone left so it was just me, Jake, Logan and Chloe, they sat me and Jake down on the bench and lectured us about how \"wrong we were\" J- this is coming from the guy who fucked my girlfriend *looks at Chloe* that was before you met *looks back at Logan* on my bed and I walked in on it! L- that was different okay? That was because she caught you cheating on her and wanted to make it even! J- all because I hugged Tessa?! SHES LIKE A LITTLE SISTER TO ME AND WAS GOING OUT WITH TONY AT THAT TIME! SHE WAS CRYING AND TONY WAS AT PRACTICE SO I COMFORTED HER LIKE ANY OLDER BROTHER WOULD DO! L- SHE SAW YOU KISS HER! J- WHY WOULD I DO THAT TO HER BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TONY?! L- idfk but all I know is that I\\'m still on her side about that! She had a valid reason and I agreed! J- actually forget it Logan! Watch your back Chloe, he could snake you to as he did it to me... Rik: SERIOUSLY LOGAN? YOU HAD TO SAY THAT! YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AFTER HE WALKED IN ON THAT! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE SUCH A DICK TO HIM? L- I hope he does listen to those damn texts... Jake got up and I saw the tears form in his eyes, he left and I slapped Logan. I then went after Jake and he went to where everyone was but hesitated because he didn\\'t want them to see him like this. I came up behind him and wrapped my arms around his shoulders, he relaxed a bit and I turned him around to face me. Rik: Jake?... J- y-yeah?... Rik: I\\'m sorry that he said that... J- I\\'m sorry he\\'s my brother *chuckles a bit and wipes eyes* Rik: hey, shush... I\\'m here for you and I won\\'t let that jerk get in the way of that... J- thanks rik... Rik: no problem, Pizzy Paul... We linked hands and walked to the others, I knew that he wouldn\\'t want to talk about it so each time they asked about what Logan said I automatically changed the subject to help Jake out. I felt him squeeze my hand gently and that\\'s when I knew that he was thankful. Jakes PoV: Once Logan said that it felt like a knife to the heart, it was really painful to hear my own brother say that. I sighed and we continued speaking to the group before we all split into groups, Me, Erika, Tessa and Tony as one group, Kelsi, Ryan, Sharpay and Zeke as another, Troy, Gabriella, Chad and Taylor as one more, Chance, Alex, Kade and Mackenzie as another one, Jason, Martha and the Martinez Twins as one more and then Chad T, Sunny, Nathan and Kelly as the last one. Me and the others were walking in silence and I held Erika\\'s hand, I had my head down and Tony could tell that something was wrong. A- Jake? What\\'s up?... J- ... Te: Jake, are you okay? You seem VERY QUIET, which never happens. I couldn\\'t control it and the tears fell, Tony brought me into a hug and I pulled back after awhile. I explained to them what Logan said and they were heart broken, they considered him as an older brother type of figure and he just went and stabbed me in the back... great... we walked to the field and supported Chance as the team pulled through and won! That was 2/3 and if we made it to 3/3 then we would have done our school proud! I had my final training for the fight between me and Deji today as well! We were fighting after the matches and performance as it seemed better and once we were back then it would be fine. During the match I had this really strong pain coming from my ankle, I didn\\'t think much of it as I couldn\\'t exactly say where or how much pain I was in. As the day progressed my ankle got even worse, I refused to get it checked out. Once we met back up with Chance we all headed home, I sat on my couch icing my foot and then Logan walked in with Alissa and Chloe... Ali: hey guys! *blows kiss to jake* X except Jake- hey! *waves to her* Te: what is she doing here? *whispered to Jake* J- *whispers back to Tessa* I dunno, *looks at Alissa and talks normally* hey guys, what\\'s up? Ali: well... here\\'s the thing. You see my birthdays coming up and I was wondering as we\\'re gonna be in Ohio for it then maybe I could have the party here... Rik: SURE! Te: yeah! Can she Jake?... J- uhhhh, sure... why not... *shrugs* X except Jake- YAY! Ali: umm Jake can me and Logan talk to you... J- fine... *rolls eyes* I followed them outside and that\\'s when all hell broke loose. Ali: have fun Jakey! *flirty voice* J- what do you mean? L- Jake, I hope you understand that you made me do that! You were the one who acted like a dick and I showed Alissa a good time, if you act that way to Erika I guess I\\'ll be forced to do the same to her... *smiles creepily* J- are you being serious right now? Logan, why are you doing this? L- because, you treated her wrong and I treated her right. She wants her revenge still so ima gonna help her! J- we made up Alissa! Ali: you knew about the plan Jake and Erika blackmailed me so now that she deleted the evidence I can do whatever the fuck I want! J- ughhh... why didn\\'t I actually do it! L- that was your choice, not mine! I stormed back into the house and didn\\'t stop even when Erika called my name, I walked straight into my room and locked the door. I laid on my bed but then these images of my brother having sex with Alissa came back and I couldn\\'t stay on that bed, I sat on the floor with my back leaning against the mattress. Erika soon managed to come in because I forgot that the lock was broken and she sat next to me, each time she tried asking me what happened my eyes shot open and I almost threw up I couldn\\'t deal with the fact that Logan an Alissa did it on my bed... Rik: Jake? Are you okay?... J- ... Rik: Jake?... J- ... Rik: baby, please talk to me... what happened? J- JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE! UGHHHHHHH *got up and sat on his bed* Erika ran out the room crying and Tessa soon called Chance and Tony over as it was only Me, Tessa, Erika, Kade, Mackenzie, Logan, Alissa and Chloe at the house. Well I think Chloe left from feeling uncomfortable but I did vaguely remember her apologising on herself and Logan\\'s actions. I accepted and then before I knew it I heard the front door go and then I heard Tony and Chance... Tessa\\'s PoV: As soon as I heard Jake yell I knew that Erika started crying, she came out of his room and went into Logan\\'s. I ran into his room and sat there comforting her and letting her tell me what happened. I heard the front door go and soon enough Logan and Alissa were getting kicked out, it was kind of weird hearing Logan her kicked out his own house but at the same time it was funny... I heard Kade say Logan\\'s room and then Chance and Tony were born already in there at lightning speed. Ch- what happened? Te: JAKE TOOK IT TOO FAR! A- crap, Erika you know that he would never say that to you. Logan and Alissa got to him and it pissed him off... She then got up and ran to his room, we all followed and we just walked in. Erika was on top of Jake, who had his head in his hands, and was sobbing into his hair. We all sat around him and started talking to him, like asking what happened and stuff like that... Ch- are you OK Jake?... J- no I\\'m not, but thanks for coming guys. I really appreciate it. Te: look Jake, I don\\'t know if you meant what you said to Erika earlier but you did make her extremely upset. J- Ik, I\\'m sorry Erika. I didn\\'t mean any of it but I\\'m just really upset rn. Rik: It\\'s okay. Do you wanna talk about what happened? All Tony told us was that Alissa and Logan got inside your head... and I wanna be there for you... J- I\\'m not ready just yet but I swear I will later... A- well... now that\\'s sorted, what are we gonna do with Logan and Alissa? J- idk... Ch- right now let\\'s all relax and forget about this for awhile... Tony\\'s PoV: After awhile Jake said that he was going on a drive so me and Chance decided not to let him go alone, we asked if we could go and he said OK. We all got in the car and drove for a bit before we heard a bang and everything went black...'][Chapter 16] ['Tony\\'s PoV: I woke up and pain immediately spread across my body, I looked around and saw Tessa sobbing. I realised that I was in the hospital but how? I didn\\'t remember anything from the car ride, all I can remember was this massive bang and then it went black. Soon enough everything came flooding back to me and I tried sitting up but hissed in pain, Tessa was soon at my side and we kissed. A- how\\'s Jake and Chance? *concern deep in his voice* Te: Jake got it worse then both of you, he\\'s still unconscious and then Chance woke up around an hour ago and he had struggling to breathe type of things happen to him... A- what\\'s the full extent of Jakes injuries?... Te: your car got flown into the wall of the highway and Jake smacked his head on it causing him to black out and then all the metal was bent inwards, he has a lot more damage done to him and the doctors didn\\'t know how bad they were until taking a better look at him... A- wow... is-is he going to be okay? Te: we dunno but Erika is freaking out... do you wanna talk to Erika?... A- as long as your in the room then yeah... Te: OK Tony... We smiled at each other and soon enough Erika walked in, she had massive, red puffs underneath her eyes and you could clearly tell that she hadn\\'t stopped crying... A- hey... Rik: h-hey... *sniffles* A- he\\'s going to be okay, Erika... Rik: how do you know? *starts to cry* he\\'s still unconscious and the doctors have no idea when he\\'ll wake up! A- who\\'s here?... Rik: Just us and Alex... she\\'s with Chance who got the all clear to be discharged... Te: he\\'s getting out right now, I told them to head to your room Tony... It was about 20 minutes until Alex and Chance both walked in, Chance looked pale but he wasn\\'t in pain and was fine now... A- considering you had struggle breathing, you got to get out earlier!... *chuckles a bit* Al: do any of you remember what happened? Chanthony- sort of... Ch- Tony, you go first... A- I remember hearing a massive bang then seeing the world spin like mad. I heard Jake groan cuz he was in pain, I heard Chance hit his head and I saw blood on the wall closest to Jake... he must have hit his head on that then... Ch- I remember that but then I remember you trying to wake Jake up and you couldn\\'t and then everyone was trying to get out of their cars but then the person kept on ramming their car into the side of Jakes and that\\'s it... Te: guys... that\\'s horrible... Rik: how are you guys still alive?... Chanthony- thank Jake, he was the one driving and made sure that we weren\\'t on the dangerous side... Rik: that\\'s Jake for ya, always putting people first... Ch- do you guys know why Logan was acting like a dick to him in the first place?... Terika: yep... Ch- what happened?... Rik: well me and Jake started getting lectured by Logan but then Jake said \"coming from the person who fucked my girlfriend and I walked in on it\" then they started shouting at each other and then Logan said \"I hope he does listen to them damn texts\" and that was the end of the conversation, well not before I slapped him... Te: he was so rude to Jake! A- yep... like why would you say that, it\\'s bad enough you \"did it\" but why do that to your younger brother like that\\'s messed up. It\\'s like Jake and Chloe kissing! Ch- yep... well, should we tell everyone else what happened? X- yep... Team 10 bitches group chat: IceAge Squirrel: hello... Troy Bolton️: what\\'s up guys? AT3: ummm, we\\'ve got to tell you guys something... Zeke Baylor: you know you can tell us anything right? TrickyRik: well um, we\\'re at the hospital... Gabriella Montez️: WHAT? WHY? IceAge Squirrel: basically me, Jake and Tony were in Jakes car and the next thing we know is that we get rammed into the wall on the highway and then they are repeatedly ramming their car into the side of Jakes and that\\'s all we remember... Troy Bolton️: who\\'s got the worse injuries? AT3: Jake Zeke Baylor: how bad?... AT3: we don\\'t know fully as he\\'s still unconscious but when we were getting rammed into the highway wall Jake did smash his head on the wall... Troy Bolton️: ouch, we\\'ll be down in a bit. OK? AT3: okay... End of chat We turned our phones off and started talking to each other, a doctor soon came in and explained what happened in more detail. I was so concerned about Jake that I didn\\'t even realise that they were still talking to me, once they stopped I decided to ask about Jake. A- is Jake okay? Like how bad is it?... Nurse: I\\'m sorry, who?... A- Jake, Jake Paul Nurse: he\\'s gone for an x-ray... Ch- was this about his ankle? Nurse: yes... and before you ask we still don\\'t know how bad his injuries are... We all sighed and prayed that Jake would be okay, it was awhile before everyone arrived and when I said everyone I meant EVERYONE... Logan, Chloe, Alissa, Troy, Chad, Chad T, Martinez Twins, Kade, Nathan, Kelly, Erika\\'s cousin Lauren, Jakes parents, my dad, chances mom, Taylor, Gabriella, Jason, Zeke, Coach Bolton even Miss Darbus was there because we forgot to mention that we all needed two chaperones and plus it was funny to watch Coach and Darbus to fight with each other... there were a lot more people and then my dad, chances mom, Troy, Gabriella and Chad and Taylor came to see us and we were chilling with them and we explained properly what happened. Erika was with Jake and hadn\\'t left his side since she went back into his room, Tessa then got a message and she read it out loud... Te: Jake woke up... Ch- THATS MY BOIIIIII! A- tell whoever you\\'re texting—... Te: Erika... A- tell ERIKA that we are so happy! Jakes PoV: Black, all I could see was blackness and it felt as if I was completely numb. I could hear tiny murmurs but that was it, I felt someone hold me hand but I couldn\\'t speak to them. I wanted to know who it was and what happened, all I remembered was that Logan and Alissa pissed me off... when I heard crying I knew that it was Erika and that I had to get out of this thing. Where even was I? It took awhile but I opened my eyes and saw the girl of my dreams looking straight at me, tears spilled from her eyes and I wiped them away carefully, not wanting to hurt myself even more. Rik: jake... w-welcome back... *laughs and crys* J- hey... thanks for being that light that helped me wake up *raspy voice* She kissed me and I kissed back, suddenly this extremely sharp pain was spread across my body and I couldn\\'t help but groan because of how painful it was... Rik: h-hey, are you okay? Like you shouldn\\'t have that pain... J- n-nahhh I\\'m sure it\\'s just my body getting caught up with what happened. Rik: do you remember what happened? J- I dunno, my memory\\'s fuzzy and it\\'s like annoying me... Rik: everyone\\'s happy that you\\'re awake... J- how long was i out for?... Rik: a solid couple of hours... Chance woke up after being in here for only 10 minutes, Tony woke up an hour ago... J- are they okay? Rik: Chance got discharged and then Tony has to stay overnight and they might keep you for an extra night... J- the football match *yawns* Rik: get some sleep, you really need it... And with that I shut my eyes and fell asleep, Erika kissed me on the cheek and I\\'m guessing she left because once I woke up she was changed into a different outfit completely. Rik: hey... J- hey... Rik: Tony just got discharged, they said that he was fine and then once he\\'s done they are coming here okay? J- okay *whispered* Rik: someone\\'s still tired... *jokes with Jake* J- yep... *yawns* Tony and the group soon came in and they looked really happy that I was alive... A- how do you feel? It was yesterday that we were in here because of you and now we got admitted for something you didn\\'t do... J- literally it feels like I got stabbed like freaking 50 times and then a truck hit me, it\\'s that bad... X- ouch... Ch- when you getting out?... Rik: he has to stay for two nights,.. Ka- dude, you\\'re gonna miss the game... J- Ik... J- what even happened? I literally cant remember anything other then Logan and Alissa pissing me off... Chanthony- well... let\\'s just say that you want to remember Logan and Alissa... J- it\\'s that bad?... Rik: just tell him please, it\\'s torture watching him be like this and not know! A- well after Alissa and Logan pissed you off you said you were going on a drive, me and Chance didn\\'t let you go alone because it\\'s safety and then we got onto the highway and we got pit manoeuvred into the side of the highway wall. You smacked your head against the wall so that\\'s most likely why you don\\'t remember that much... J- that explains a lot! But who would do that? Ch- we don\\'t know... we don\\'t know... I tried sitting up but couldn\\'t so Erika helped me and soon enough Logan and Alissa walked in followed by an embarrassed Chloe. J- w-what are you guys doing here?... L- ummmm... well we heard what happened to you guys and wanted to see if you were OK... J- thanks... Ali: Jake, I\\'m so sorry for everything I\\'ve put you through... J- you should have believed me and had trust in me... that\\'s what hurt that you couldn\\'t trust me... Ali: I\\'m well and truly sorry Jake... J- you should have thought about that before you fucked my brother... Ali: Jake, I thought you were cheating on me with Tessa! J- Why would I do that to you or Tony? Tony is like a brother to me and Tessa is like a little sister to me! Alissa you WERE my girlfriend!... Ka- let\\'s not forget but this was a very abusive relationship on Jakes end... we watched you constantly slap him or hurt him! You can\\'t even deny it! Jake covered for you, he said to everyone it was the fights he got into after school... J- I don\\'t understand why you agreed Logan! You knew how bad it was... it killed me to walk in on you two... I lost my brother that day and I had only recently let him walk back into my life! And now he went and backstabbed me again... L- Jake?... did you really think that it was only Alissa that needed revenge?... J- what do you mean?... L- you always were that kid who was a bully to kids so I guess I made it even for them... J- are you being serious right now?!... I literally cant with either of you anymore! *sighs and tenses slightly* Rik: Jake, calm down... *whispered to Jake* J- I-I can\\'t... they\\'re pissing me off... *whispered back to Erika* Rik: alright so stop annoying Jake... I think you\\'ve both done enough damage... L- we\\'re just getting started Jake... Chloe: LOGAN! Leave him alone, he\\'s your little brother, he\\'s family treat him with some respect! L- sorry Chloe but he deserves it... Rik: some brother you are... he loves you! Jake has been through so much and you know he has! What\\'s made you act like this Logan? You were always asking if he was alright and being really nice! L- well I guess people change... J- got that right... Ali: like Logan said, we\\'re only getting started Jake... They left and I wasn\\'t happy at all, Logan literally turned the tables and I have no idea why. Rik: Jake?... you okay?... J- yep... I\\'ll be fine... T- dude, ehhhh... should we tell him *looks at chad* C- we have to... *looks at Jake* ummm well Logan and Alissa kind of \"did it\" on your bed... *squints eyes* J- he just cheated on Chloe... HE CHEATED ON HER... *laughs* OMG... We have blackmail on Logan... Ch- OMG WE DO!... A- THIS IS GONNA BE FUN... Everyone left after awhile and my head just exploded in pain, I couldn\\'t think straight and it was like I was going in and out of consciousness again and I felt like I was gonna throw up. I did once the doctor came in and he wasn\\'t surprised that I had, he cleaned it up and looked at me. I felt like shit and I had just convinced Erika to go home and sleep, the doctor started checking my temperature and checking if I could see. My vision started getting blurry and soon afterwards it was all black for a solid 10 minutes, the doctor was outside with a nurse. My head was going mental and I shut my eyes as soon as he walked in... Doctor- Jake? Are you okay? How do you feel?... J- like I\\'m gonna be sick again *whispered* Doctor- okay so what\\'s going on is your body is getting rid of all the bacteria inside it. This is what normally happens when you\\'re sick at home okay, so it\\'s completely normal. But we also have you something to make you throw up, that\\'s why you did we just didn\\'t expect you to pass out afterwards... J- o-okay... *mumbled* Doctor- how does your head feel?... J- like it\\'s gonna explode... *mumbled* Doctor- we have this bed pan for you to throw up in, incase you need to okay? J- yep... Doctor- I\\'ll be back later... He left and I relaxed into the bed more, my head then started going mental again and I felt this vile thing rise up in my throat. I swallowed it down and quickly regretted it because I then threw up again, this couldn\\'t get any worse could it? Well it just did as Alissa walked into my room and sat down on the seat to the right of me... at least I was being sick to the left... Ali: someone\\'s not well... J- what do you want Alissa? Ali: to show you something that me and Logan made... J- why are you doing this?... Ali: because, it\\'s fun to mess with you... She then pulled up her laptop and sat it on my lap, she plugged in a USB and let it play... I was so hurt after listening to that, Logan was my brother and he made this... I grabbed my phone and spoke to him about it, Alissa had left and said that I could give her laptop back to her later and the USB was mine to keep... In Chat: Pizzy Paul️: LOGAN! WTF... LoganPool: like the surprise then? Pizzy Paul️: YOU SERIOUSLY DID THAT... I THOUGHT WE WERE BROTHERS... LoganPool: treat women right dude... Pizzy Paul️: how was it doing it with Alissa on my bed then?... LoganPool: Chloe let me! Pizzy Paul️: SHE WOULD NEVER DO THAT... LoganPool: you caught my bluff, we broke up and then me and Alissa hooked up... Pizzy Paul️: I fucking hate you, why would you do this? I was glad that you were my older brother but I guess \"Rise of the Pauls\" means nothing to you, same as me... so you have to choose now... Me or Alissa because you can\\'t have both... LoganPool: have fun without a brother Jake... Pizzy Paul️: Bye Logan... LoganPool: bye Jake... I wiped the tears from my eyes and then the doctor walked in, he was beaming which meant something good might happen... Doctor- you are being discharged! We will give you crutches OK? J- cool, that\\'s awesome and one by me!... Doctor- Dan Costell is picking you up and will be arriving soon so let\\'s get you set up. Have you used crutches before? J- yep! He re-taught me how to use crutches and then dan came, he saw me on my bed and helped me with my stuff. Dan- Erika has no idea and everyone\\'s at yours... J- even Logan?... Dan- with Alissa... A tear escaped from my eye and Dan noticed, he rubbed his arm up and down on mine and I looked at him. Dan- Jake? What\\'s up? I know what happened between you and Alissa but I thought you made up... J- nope, she\\'s hooked up with Logan and they did it on my bed... he then chose Alissa over me when he knew everything that happened between us... *wipes eyes* Dan- I\\'m sorry Jaker... I smiled, I hadn\\'t heard that nickname in awhile. We got out and he grabbed my bag, I hopped into the house and opened the door. He walked in first and then he said that he had a surprise for them, everyone looked and I came into view.. J- yo! Rik: JAKE! *cries* J- hey, guys... X- DUDE WE THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL! J- nope! I leaned my crutches against the wall and limped my way over to Erika, she didn\\'t approve of me doing that but hey she would have to deal with me doing that! I kissed her and she kissed back, we hugged and we stayed like that for awhile before we all sat down on the couch. J- guys, someone gave me a little surprise in the hospital so I think we should watch it... *looks directly at Logan and Alissa* Ali: use my laptop! J- it\\'s in my bag, and if we can mirror it up to the TV then that\\'s fine! We linked it up to the TV and then I played the video, everyone hated Logan but the end part was got them pissed off. X except Jake- LOGAN YOU DICK! C.B- LANGUAGE! X- ENGLISH! C.B- wow *laughs* T- why would you do that to your own brother?... L- I have a brother? I thought he was this muppet that my mom had that I wanted to be an accident! J- do you guys hear that annoying sound? What is it?... *acts dumb* P: what happened between you two?... J- ask the guy who did it with Alissa... OH AND IS HOOKING UP WITH HER! Chloe: LOGAN REALLY! UGHHHH WE\\'RE OVER!... J- I TOLD YOU THAT SHE WOULDNT ALLOW IT! Chloe stormed out and Erika went after her, me and Logan kept on arguing, and I stood up, until our mom broke it up. P: THATS ENOUGH! BOYS STOP! J- fine... *rolls eyes* P: Don\\'t you dare roll your eyes at me young man! J- why? What are you gonna do? Bring David here to beat my ass? P: JAKE WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?! J- NOTHING THAT CONCERNS YOU! YOU\\'RE ONLY TAKING AN INTEREST NOW BECAUSE DAVID IS IN FUCKING JAIL!! *tenses dramatically* A- Jake, calm down bro... Dan- please Jake... J- *sighs* fine whatever... *rolls eyes and sits back down* Ali: we still haven\\'t finished with you Jakey... *flirty Voice* J- fuck off alissa, my \"brother\" maybe immune to this but I\\'m not. I ain\\'t gonna fall for your shit again, I\\'ve had it with both of you... *death stares Alissa* Dan- Jake, calm it... J- sorry Dan... Ch- Alissa get the hell out... Ali: FINE! I\\'ll see you on Friday then!... With that she left and Logan left as well! I sighed and leaned back, I couldn\\'t deal with them. Dan- Jake?... J- what?... Dan- are you okay?... J- I\\'m fine, he\\'s just gone and fucking pissed me off! Ughhhhhh... Dan- forget about him and Alissa and relax... c\\'mon let\\'s not let them ruin it! J- thanks Dan... He smiled and the rest of the night was great, Erika and Chloe came back and I hugged Chloe. She hugged back and apologised for what Logan was doing. Chloe: Jake, I\\'m so sorry that he\\'s doing this... J- it\\'s okay, it\\'s not your fault that he\\'s being a dick... She smiled and we walked (well I hopped) to the couch and sat down, we all relaxed and eventually me and Erika fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and ran to the sink, I threw up and before long Erika was behind me rubbing my back. She checked my temperature and said it felt normal, I then threw up again and remembered that the doctor gave me this weird thing that\\'ll make me be sick. We stayed perched over the sink for awhile before my mom came down and saw me looking pale, she immediately asked what was up and then Erika explained it to her. P: are you OK Jake?... Rik: Pam, the doctor gave him this thing that makes him throw up every now and again... P: ahhh, okay... J- can someone give me a hand back over to the couch as I ran up here... PRik: Sure! They helped me to the couch and my mom gave me this bowl so if I was sick anymore then I wouldn\\'t have to go far. I went back to sleep and was waking up every now and again because of the thing, I managed to keep Erika up most of the night and after the 5th time of me being sick she decided that she wasn\\'t going to school and she persuaded Mom to let me stay as well.'][Chapter 17] ['Alissa\\'s PoV: It was the day of my party at Jakes and we all knew that today would be the best, Jake hadn\\'t spoken to Logan or even set foot in his room since he fount out. It was our last full day in Ohio before we all left to go back to Albuquerque and honestly I was glad because I couldn\\'t deal with Jake rn, he was being such a piss take and it pissed me off. L- hey baby, you okay? *kisses her cheek* Ali: yeah, you? L- yep! Are you gonna come clean today?... Ali: and we should make out straight in front of Jake! He will be sooooo pissed it\\'ll be so funny! *chuckles at the thought* We finished getting ready and headed over to Jakes, the football team had won their match and yesterday was a chill day. We knew that everyone would be at Jakes but that\\'s what made it the best place to announce it! It was around 12:30 pm when everyone arrived and started to party, Jake and all his friends were outside and as soon as Jake and Logan made eye contact all hell broke loose. L- what ya doin\\' there Jakey?... J- nothing that fucking concerns you... L- nahhh, you can never keep a secret from your older bro! Chanthony- back off Logan... *stands up and goes behind Jake* L- or what? Are you gonna slap me or punch me? Oh I\\'m so scared! *laughs* J- shut the fuck up Logan! Why are you doing this?! Logan shoved Jake and then Jake pushed him back as well. They both squared up and Chance and Tony were in the middle of it. Soon enough all of Jakes friends were behind him and were trying to pull him back but Logan gripped onto him and punched him, Jake punched back and soon enough they were fighting. I grabbed hold of Logan and we looked at their faces, Logan had a bloody nose and a black eye, Jake had the exact same just with the side of his head was clipped. We backed them away from each other and I kissed Logan, he calmed down and I saw Jake look more hurt then anything. I watched him walk inside and that was it... X- YOU ABSOLUTE TWAT! They all walked inside as well and that left me and Logan in the backyard, I cleaned him up and we kissed. He apologised for fighting Jake and I accepted, I understood completely why he did it. We walked back inside and no one questioned what happened to Logan which was perfect! We enjoyed the rest of the party until we had to clean up, me and Logan announced that we were a couple and everyone congratulated us! It was around 1:30 am when Jake came back and he looked tired, shook and pissed all at the same time. I\\'m guessing his ankle was healed enough for him to walk on as I couldn\\'t find his crutches and he was walking just fine. P: Jake! You shouldn\\'t be walking! J- don\\'t fucking care mom... *rolls eyes* P: Jake? What happened? You look as if you\\'ve been in a fight! J- yep, *looks at Logan, then looks back at Pam* me and Tony were play fighting and it got out of hand... P: you sure you feel okay? J- CAN EVERYONE PLEASE STAY OUT OF MY PRIVACY! IM FUCKING FINE I DONT NEED PEOPLE TO QUESTION IT *tenses* P: Jake, calm down! We are all just worried about you! You weren\\'t here the entire day, you weren\\'t answering your phone and I was worried! J- I worry a lot of people mom, I\\'m used to it! And with that he stormed out the house again, me and Logan were shocked. We knew he was pissed but not that pissed, Logan offered to call Jake, which he actually did, and Pam allowed him. Logan called Jake but it went straight to voicemail, I could see that Logan was getting a little bit worried about Jake as he usually answers to anyone! Ali: do you want us to go find him Pam? P: if you don\\'t mind! That would be amazing, thanks! L- alright, call Chance etc seeing if they know where he is. I\\'ll call Erika on the way in moms car! He connected his phone to the Bluetooth thing and called Erika, I was surprised that she answered but then she freaked out when she heard what Logan said. She told us that she would try calling him and she ended it, Logan actually looked anxious because Jake was somewhere in Ohio! Logan\\'s PoV: As much as I detest Jake he is still my brother and I had to find him, I didn\\'t understand why I was sending so much hate to him until I remembered that Alissa has blackmail on me and that\\'s why Jake hasn\\'t been talking to me. I was really nervous about Jake, he wasn\\'t at the house and I know that he hasn\\'t eaten anything since Erika last made him, which was awhile ago, and he barely spoke to anyone actually. I called Erika and this happened.. On Call: Erika: WTF? Why are you calling me Logan? Logan- Jakes gone off somewhere and we don\\'t know where. Me and Alissa are busy looking for him, he completely back chatted our mom and walked out again... Erika: OMG... HAVE YOU TRIED CALLING HIM? ACTUALLY I\\'LL CALL HIM. IM SO SCARED NOW! Logan- I tried calling him and he didn\\'t answer... *sighs* Erika: I\\'ll call you if I have an update... *sniffles* Logan- don\\'t cry, we will find him! End of call... Ali: he\\'ll be okay Logan, he\\'s a tough guy... L- I messed up Alissa, I really did and now Jake could be god knows where *sighs* Ali: let\\'s stop by the hotel because he could be there with Troy and all them! We headed to the hotel and saw Troy outside, we ran to him and he looked confused... T- can I help you?... L- we don\\'t know where Jake is! Like I know I\\'ve been a dick to him but he\\'s still my baby bro!... T- you tried round Chance or Tony\\'s? Anyway, why the sudden change of heart? L- many reasons which I don\\'t wanna explain, but please help us find him! Literally I\\'m mentally stabbing myself because of how much I\\'ve hurt him... *wipes tears from eyes* T- the wildcats will help you look... ONLY if you start being a caring brother again and stop backstabbing him! Lalissa: DONE! He pulled out his phone and soon enough the guys were all slowly making their way to the entrance, I noticed that all the cheerleaders (minus Erika, Tessa, Alex, Sunny, Alissa, Kelly and Erika\\'s cousin Lauren) T- Jakes \"disappeared\" and now Logan is actually being nice and wanting to find him, I think we should help because would you all help if you were in this position?... They all nodded and soon enough the entire team was looking for him, I had this little bit of hope spread inside me and we didn\\'t stop looking until it was sunrise. My dad had called in advance saying that Jake could be at his spot, Erika drove me up there and like dad had implied he was there. Jake had his arms leaned against the railing and had his hood up, I took a deep breath and approached him cautiously. I leaned next to him and Jake looked down, we stayed in a comfortable silence until I realised that Jake wouldn\\'t talk to me. L- Jake... I\\'m sorry I was acting so rude to you! Alissa had black mail on me (about me and her) and I didn\\'t want Chloe knowing but once you said it out loud she no longer had dirt on me... J- ... L- please talk to me Jake! You haven\\'t eaten in days and you\\'re sleep deprived! I get it that you don\\'t want to talk to me but you should talk to someone about it! J- ... L- Jake... me and Alissa are together but I didn\\'t realise that she\\'s pretty much using me to get back at you! I get it that you don\\'t wanna talk to me but please think about it as I can\\'t deal with this forever... J- we have our show today... *whispered* L- so today is our last day here then? J- yep... *mumbled* L- let\\'s just go home and then we can help you get set up for the show! Where is it? J- the auditorium... L- let\\'s head back Jake, everyone is probably worried... Jake then walked to the car with me and Erika hugged him, Jake looked like he didn\\'t want it but we all knew that he did. He sat in the back and me and Erika sat in the front, we told everyone to meet us as ours and they did. Jake was \"asleep\" in the back because each time we spoke to him he didn\\'t answer and then he had his eyes closed. I heard Erika sigh and I looked over at her, I\\'m guessing she didn\\'t sleep because of Jake and I felt bad because we all knew that Jake wouldn\\'t mean to make her do that. We arrived home and got out, we helped Jake out and I took him upstairs into my room because I knew he wouldn\\'t want to sleep on his bed, as soon as his head hit he pillow he was out. I walked downstairs and everyone looked tired. L- you need to get your energy up boys! The big shows tonight! Ali: I thought yesterday was our last day!? L- Jake reminded me of the show so it won\\'t be the last day, today is... We all fell asleep for a solid couple of hours and was woken up to Team 10 shouting at us... Rik: guys?... T- what\\'s up?... Ch- what\\'s he doing here?... L- A) I live here and B) me and Jake made up! X- REALLY?! LRik: YEP! Rik: I was there as a witness! Chanthony- sorry dude... L- it\\'s fine... A- let\\'s go wake Jake up! L- NO! He just went to sleep for the first time since he got discharged so if you wake him up he won\\'t sleep! Ch- ah, okay. I\\'m craving Taco Bell! J- I heard Taco Bell... *tiredly* Jake walked down the stairs and looked exhausted... I went up to him and hugged him, he hugged back and then we continued talking until Jake and the boys went to go get Taco Bell. Tony insisted on driving as Jake wasn\\'t in the best state to do so, I went with them and Jake leaned his head into Kade\\'s lap, which he didn\\'t mind, and fell asleep. I mugged a photo and posted it on instagram... In about 5 minutes it got 1,299,450 likes and then 20,374 comments, the majority were hate comments aimed at Jake. He woke up and was shaking like mad, the guys (Troy and them lot weren\\'t there) realised that this is what I meant when I said that he wouldn\\'t be able to sleep. His breathing increased and he was looking around frantically, we pulled over and helped Jake calm down... L- Jake... look at me... J- ... *breathing heavily* L- Jake... bro... you\\'re okay, you\\'re safe... His breathing calmed a little bit and we took his seat belt off so he could have a proper breather, I pulled him close to me and held him. His shaking relaxed and his breathing was almost even. L- jake... it\\'s okay... shushhhh, it\\'s alright... I let Jake cry into me and we waited awhile before heading off. I held Jake as he hadn\\'t completely calmed down, I could see the tears in his eyes as he hadn\\'t gotten over what happened in the accident. Kade was rubbing his back whilst I whispered comforting things into his ear, everyone was deeply concerned about Jake after that. Once he calmed down he leaned against me and I held him, we arrived at Taco Bell and got what we needed. Jake had his eyes shut and every now and again his breathing would hitch but I reassured him that he was safe. I kissed the top of his head and we arrived home, Jake walked in and got a drink. Jakes PoV: I was asleep in the car and suddenly i was caught in this dream, it was the accident. I jolted awake and was fairly sure I had a panic attack, everyone was quite worried but Logan kept on reassuring me that everything was fine but it didn\\'t work. My breathing increased and I was shaking way too much, Logan brought me close to him and let my cry. Kade rubbed my back and I knew everyone was watching but I didn\\'t care, I kept on crying until I heard Logan whisper some things into my ear. He kissed the top of my head and I leaned against him, we stayed like that until we arrived home. Thankfully you couldn\\'t tell that I had been crying so I walked in first and grabbed myself a bottle of water, they came in afterwards and we all ate. Logan pretty much forced me to eat this because Erika had been trying as well, although you couldn\\'t tell that I had been crying I was on edge quite a bit. Each time a bang was made it literally made me jump, Chance and Tony got it as well because of the bang from the crash. Everyone could tell that there was a bit of tension in the room, it was mainly located between Logan, Chanthony and Team 10. We all finished our food and got ready for the show, we took the bus there. Tessa pulled me to the side as we were about to go on for our rehearsals... Te: Jake? Tony told me that you had a panic attack, I think that you should tell Rik in case it happens again... J- uhhhh... y-you heard about that... Te: jake? Are you sure that you\\'re fine after that? J- yeah, I\\'m fine Tessa... *looks down* I walked away and heard Tessa call my name, I heard her sigh and we got on with rehearsal. Everyone tried talking to me but I blocked them out, I needed to think after the panic attack. When it came to mine and Erika\\'s song \"Jerika\" something seemed off, well I wasn\\'t really talking to anyone but she seemed less energetic and that she was constantly looking at Tessa. After our practise she went on to saying that she needed air and Tessa joined her, soon afterwards all the girls were bombarding me with questions which I couldn\\'t hear properly as to me they turned into whispers. Ta: ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO US? C- Girls back off, he\\'s gonna be focused on the show so don\\'t expect him to listen... I nodded at Chad and he smiled, we then went on to practise My Teachers and Ohio Fried Chicken. During the show we were gonna play truth or dare, Troy ended up getting a dare to do and Gabriella didn\\'t even know about it. No it wasn\\'t for him to propose as he was doing it on the same day I was going to propose to Erika. He was gonna take her to their spot and we would text each other when and like it would be awesome! When Erika came back inside she looked better and instantly needed to talk to me. Rik: Jake... Logan told me about... J- Oh... *looks down* Rik: you seem really off, you\\'re on edge. Jake... J- ummmm... Rik: baby, what\\'s wrong... J- n-nothing... Rik: Jake, please tell me... J- it\\'s-it\\'s just I don\\'t wanna talk about it because it wasn\\'t the first time that it\\'s happened... Rik: Jake... *wipes tears from Jake\\'s eyes* J- uhhh... I haven\\'t gotten over the accident and I don\\'t think I ever will... *starts to cry* Erika hugged me and I cleaned up my face, she held both of my hands and kissed me. She then told me something that I didn\\'t expect... Rik: Jake... T-Tessa thinks I\\'m pregnant... J- w-what, w-why?... Rik: apparently I look it... J- oh... Rik: enough about me, you know you shouldn\\'t be walking Jake... J- i can\\'t feel it... I can barely feel anything tbh... Rik: Jake... p-please take it easy... I\\'m really worried about you... J- most people are... *sighs* Rik: just promise that you\\'ll talk to someone, I hate seeing you like this... J- uhhhh... *wipes eyes* Rik: j-Jake... I love you, remember that... J- I love you too, and I do know that. But you better remember that I love you too as well *kisses her cheek* Rik: so if I was pregnant you wouldn\\'t mind?... *takes his hands* J- no, I wouldn\\'t care if we had children because I\\'m with the lady of my life and whatever happens we\\'ll face it together! *intertwine fingers with her* Rik: awww thanks... *kisses him* I kissed back and she wrapped her arms around my neck and deepened the kiss, i put my hands on her waist and kissed back. We pulled back for air and saw that everyone was looking at us, I blushed and looked away. Rik: we should probably finish this later *winks at Jake* J- that depends lil goat, *whispers to Erika* you need to take the test... Rik: will you be there?... I nodded and we finished our last run through before it went to costume, as I was changing for our first go I noticed that my ribs were all scarred and it was all bruised. I looked at Chance and Tony and they had the exact same thing just less extreme, my chest started to hurt and my ankle did as well. I ignored it at first and finished getting ready, as we about to do our first time my chest was really bothering me. I made it through the run through but then we had to do a certain song because we hadn\\'t quite got it, as we were doing that I started coughing really badly. Everyone stared at me and that\\'s when I put my t-shirt over my mouth and it quietened it, Erika came over and started rubbing my back and then she took me off the stage. She took me to the back of the auditorium and started asking me all these questions which I couldn\\'t answer as I was still coughing. Rik: Jake? Are you okay?... J- y-y *coughs* eah.. *coughs* Rik: let me feel your temperature... She checked my forehead and then took her hand off, she was confused most likely because I felt fine. Rik: you don\\'t have a temperature... I\\'m so confused, does your chest hurt? I nodded as i couldn\\'t answer properly yet. She then pulled her phone out and soon enough my mom was on the phone. On call: Pam: Erika? What\\'s up? Rik: Jakes chest is hurting and now he\\'s coughing and can\\'t stop!... Pam: give him a drink... actually I\\'m coming... Rik: okay... End of call... Erika looked at me and the coughing had died down, I leaned against the wall and shut my eyes. Erika was rubbing my arm and soon enough my Mom had arrived and was fussing over me, I stayed quiet the entire time she was talking to me. She was constantly checking my temperature and trying to talk to me, Erika then stopped her and we went back inside. We finished rehearsal and then we got changed again into our beginning outfits, the entire time I was silent. (The show...:) It was then the end of the show and we convinced the Martinez Twins to sing Despacito... We all chilled at mine and then everyone else left to get packed, I put the hood up on my hoodie and walked outside. As I was walking around my ankle started to kill and I ended up limping my way back inside, I grabbed ice and iced it until Erika came round and took the test. My mom knew what was happening so at least I wouldn\\'t get lectured, as Erika took the test we were watching a movie. (It\\'s just the reaction part) Rik: OMG BABY!... J- so you are??... Rik: according to this test I am! J- how do we know if it\\'s accurate or not? Rik: should I take another one or wait? J- I\\'d say wait... We waited until the next day and when Erika took the test it came out positive again... we hugged and I teared up I was really confused as I thought that she was on the pill and I used protection... I stopped thinking about that and just hugged Erika again. We then walked outside and told my mom, she cried and hugged us both. I was so shocked that she wasn\\'t angry with me, I put my arm around Erika\\'s shoulders and rested my chin on top of her head. Rik: I wanna tell everyone... J- we\\'ve gotta catch a plane later... Rik: well the flights at 8:30 pm so we have time! J- what will our friends say?... Rik: when Tessa thought I was Tony was with her and that so he knows... J- so you\\'ll tell Tessa and I\\'ll tell Tony... Rik: yep... J- I just can\\'t believe it! Like maybe it would be a good idea to drop out... Rik: I agree... it wouldn\\'t be good to have it during high school and what happens with the ultra sounds and all that if they clash... P: that\\'s a smart idea! I\\'ll help with it!... J- now we just have to tell people... P: tell the parents first, then ease it on to your friends... J- that\\'s a good idea! P: that\\'s how me and your father told everyone about you and Logan... J- I still wanna know if it was on your bed or dad\\'s bed at his or here... P: Jake, we\\'ve gone over this... it was either the beach or in the woods... J- that\\'s my boiiiiiiiii! *laughs* Rik: oh god... *laughs* P: you are disgusting... *laughs and sighs* J- What do you expect? We then left and headed to Erika\\'s house, I was on the fence about telling them as I didn\\'t want to have messed up so it would be interesting. Erika took them into a part of the house where I couldn\\'t hear them and that\\'s what made me really anxious, my mom was rubbing little circles into my shoulder with her thumb and I stopped breathing as soon as they came past me. I looked down to avoid all eye contact and they hugged me, congratulating us. I was so happy that they didn\\'t try and murder me! Erika came back out with a grin on her face, I\\'m guessing she saw what happened. Rik: you\\'re welcome!... *grins* J- I don\\'t even wanna know what happened... P: he was actually freaking out... Rik: awwwww baby... *pecks his lips* J- should we go round Tony or Tessa\\'s? Rik: we can get them together at yours! J- okay! I got Tony round mine and so Erika got Tessa, once they arrived we sat them down. Rik: we need to tell you both something... Te: you are, aren\\'t you... J- we confirmed it this morning... A- dude... *gasps* Jerika- we\\'ve decided to drop out... Te: to take care of the baby... J- yep... A- I\\'m so happy for you both... *gets up and hugs Jake* J- thanks man... *slightly smiles* Te: when are you dropping out?... J- well basketball and football season are over so really soon for me... Rik: there are no cheerleading competitions coming up but seeing as I was the captain, Tessa I\\'m gonna make you Cheer Captain... Te: OMG... THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! *Squeals and hugs Erika* J- you guys and our parents are the only people who know... A- okay... we won\\'t say anything. I nodded and started taking some weight off of my ankle and Tony noticed the pain in my face. A- Jake? You good?... I shook my head and Tony stood up again and put my arm around his shoulders. Erika was at my right side and was rubbing my right arm, Tessa made a path for me to get to the couch without injuring my ankle more as where they were sitting had a table in front of it. Tony helped me to the couch and Tessa gave me an ice pack, I put it on my ankle and deeply regretted it. I hissed in pain and took it off immediately, Erika called my mom (as she was a nurse) and she immediately came and tried seeing if I could put pressure on it. Tony helped me stand up and once I put it on the floor I screamed in pain, I sat back down and stretched my leg. P: I told you that you shouldn\\'t be walking Jake! J- I don\\'t care mom! I was angry and I couldn\\'t do anything about it other then just solving my problems myself! P: You should have spoke to us about it Jake! We were all there for you! J- well whatever, I didn\\'t wanna talk about it because I felt ashamed and idk... *looks down* A- Jake... you need to tell your mom... P: what? Tell me what?... J- I have been having panic attacks... P: about what? J- the accident, the most recent one I\\'ve had was yesterday when we were driving to Taco Bell... A- yep... Logan helped calm him down though... P: I feel so bad! And not only do you have them but you\\'re constantly stressed or have anxiety no matter if it\\'s a lot or not... J- and to top it all off I am constantly hated... Tony pulled me into a hug and we stayed like that for awhile. He rested his chin on my head and I put my face in the crook of his neck, I pulled away after awhile and we stayed in silence until everyone (like the football team, soccer team, Coach Bolton, Mrs Darbus, basically everyone from Albuquerque that went here) arrived and we all had a barbecue. The day went so quickly that it was already time to leave Ohio. We all arrived in Albuquerque around 1:30 am and all got Uber\\'s to our houses and slept.'][Chapter 18] ['Erika\\'s PoV: Today was mine and Jakes last day at East High! Everyone was emotional and we celebrated with our friends before we officially left School. My bump had started showing and people started questioning me but we just said that it\\'s none of your business. Once we got back to Jakes his mom was in the kitchen talking to someone who sounded very familiar, me and Jake were holding hands and I felt him tense dramatically. We walked into the kitchen to see David... him and Pam were busy fighting and didn\\'t notice that we had walked in. I rubbed little circles into Jakes hand with my thumb and he relaxed a little bit, he then decided to get involved as he couldn\\'t stand this constant feud. J- why are you here David? *shakes a little bit* David- ughhhhhh, pipe down Snake! J- you sound like the people from WestLake, except the fact that they actually hurt me! *growls* David- I swear to fucking god Jake, you are on thin ice boy... *strides over to Jake* J- what\\'cha gonna do? Pussy! *gets up in David\\'s face* P: BOYS STOP! *cries* J- nah, I\\'m just getting fucking started... *walks away* David- then why\\'d you walk away? J- it could get violent pretty quickly so I ain\\'t gonna risk it... He then went and slapped Jake, he was gonna retaliate when he got pulled back. I heard Logan\\'s voice but he wasn\\'t the one who pulled Jake back, I looked to my right and saw Troy and Coach Bolton. Gabriella then walked in and we hugged, she then saw my bump and I\\'m guessing that it was time to explain. Everyone piled into the room and Chance and Tony stayed behind Jake with Troy and Coach Bolton, Pam had backed David away but we knew that he would try and get to Jake. David- LET ME FUCKING AT HIM! HE DESERVES THIS! C.B- NO HE DOESN\\'T, HES A HUMAN BEING NOT A PUNCHING BAG! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TREAT HIM LIKE THAT! J- ITS FINE IVE HAD TO GET USED TO IT! I DON\\'T FUCKING CARE ANYMORE! *walks out of Troy\\'s grip and walks straight out the door* I would have went after him but as I was carrying his child I didn\\'t want to risk anything, Troy and Logan went after him and then brought him back inside when David left. I hugged Jake and he calmed automatically, he kissed the top of my head and we sat down. He apologised for how he was acting but it wasn\\'t his fault at all, David was the one who started it. Rik: well y\\'all might be wondering about this bump... J- literally I\\'m still in shock... Rik: well I\\'m pregnant... X except Tanthony and Jerika- awwwwwwwww... Tanthony: we\\'ve known for awhile now... Ch- YOU KEPT THIS FROM ME, TONY AND JAKE! *laughs* Te: well I started suspecting it and then Tony was there when I personally asked Rik about it... Ch- ahhh okay... A- the side of your face is bleeding Jake... *points at his cheek* J- Oh is it, I\\'ll clean it up in a bit... *shrugs* Rik: Jake, go clean it up! J- fine *rolls eyes* Rik: go on Donald Trump! J- shut it Mickey! *stands up* Rik: I swear to god Jake *laughs* J- I swear to god Jake *mocks Erika* Rik: really? J- really? *mocks Erika again* Ali: hey Jake *walks in and blows him a kiss* J- *drops his phone and stares at her wide eyed* A-Alissa... Ali: hey guys! *waves at everyone* Te: what are you doing here? *death stares Alissa* Ali: calm it T... anyway Jake we need to talk! *turns and shouts at Jake* J- uhhhhh... w-why?... Ali: c\\'mon I haven\\'t got all day! Rik: Alissa, stop! He\\'s clearly not in the mood and you really aren\\'t gonna help! He\\'s not in the right mind set gonna talk to you! J- THANK YOU ERIKA! *pecks her lips* I was too shocked to say that! Ali: no Jake, we have to fucking talk. It\\'s about your dad... J- w-what!! Ali: LOGAN!!! *screams* He came running down the stairs and dragged him and Jake outside, I could tell that Jake was really nervous about his dad. I wish I could\\'ve known what she was saying but the look on both of their faces probably meant it wasn\\'t good. T- so she\\'s Alissa... I know I\\'ve seen her before but man, she can act like a proper bitch! She reminds me of Sharpay! S: I can still hurt you! G: please don\\'t! S: fine Gabi... *rolls eyes* C.B- I\\'m so confused on what happens is this group... *laughs* X- so are we *laughs as well* Ch- guys, they are coming back... We all continued our conversation and Jake sat down and shut his eyes, I could tell that he wasn\\'t in the proper mood to talk. He then pulled out his phone and started looking at Instagram, he laid his head on my shoulder and I put mine on his head. Ch- Jake?... J- ... Ch- Jake? I nudged him and he looked up from his phone at Chance, he looked confused. J- huh? What?... Ch- you good? J- yep! We all stared at him but no one brought it up because they didn\\'t know how bad it was, it was around 12:30 am when Jake left with Logan and Alissa. I was still confused but it was about his dad so I didn\\'t wanna hurt him on accident, he forgot to take his phone so I grabbed it and opened it. He didn\\'t have a passcode (well I had my fingerprint on it) so it opened automatically and I checked his texts, I was shocked. He had been getting like 20,000 texts per day telling him to go die from this same number, I checked the number in my phone and what pissed me off was that it was someone who Jake could \"trust\". I was heartbroken as I read the texts and then he got a couple more, as I read them I didn\\'t even realise that my eyes had started to water because it was that bad! I wiped the tears away and started making some food. My phone (not Jakes) went off and it was Logan, I answered and he sounded heart broken. On call: L- E-Erika?? *sniffs and voice cracks slightly* Rik: Logan? What happened? *puts down her plate and leans on the counter* L- our dad has 30 minutes left to live before they take him off of life support... Rik: omg... I\\'ll be right there! *grabs her keys and walks out the door* L- alright, me and Jake have to wait in the waiting room cause he just went into cardiac arrest. Get here as quick as possible because I don\\'t know how long Jake can hold on... Rik: what do you mean? L- he isn\\'t talking and hasn\\'t eaten since we got here, I can tell that he\\'s holding on but I don\\'t know how long he will continue... Rik: ohhhh... I\\'ll connect my phone to my Bluetooth thing so give me a sec then put Jake on please... L- of course... Rik: put him on please... J- ... Rik: jakey??? J- w-what? *whispered* Rik: I\\'m on my way, hang tight baby... J- I-Im trying... *whispered* Rik: please Jake... I\\'m like 10 minutes away... *tears filling her eyes* J- fine... *sniffs* Rik: it\\'s okay to cry Jake... we all will... J- I-I can\\'t stay in here without you, it\\'s too overwhelming... *whispered* Rik: go stand outside for a minute, get some air... J- uhhhh... o-okay... *goes outside* Rik: baby, it\\'s okay... I\\'ll be there as soon as possible, please just hang tight and stay strong. Your dad would want you to... J- o-okay... Rik: I\\'m pulling up now, I can see you... J- I see you too *whispers and ends call* I ran straight up to him after parking and held him, I kissed the side of his head as he cried into my shoulder. He was silent for a solid 5 minutes before he pulled away and said \"Hey\" J- hey *whispered* I smiled at him and took him to the bathroom to clean up his face, I saw where David slapped him and it had started bruising. I tried to touch it but he backed away and winced in pain, I didn\\'t think that David had slapped him that hard. Rik: hey it\\'s okay, I won\\'t hurt you... He then came back towards me and I touched his bruise, I could see the pain was evident in his face and he did his hair before smiling and cleaning up his face more. I put my foundation on his face as his skin tone was the same colour as the foundation and soon enough his bruise was gone, he kissed me and we walked out to where Logan was. Jake gave Logan his phone back before sitting down next to him and putting his head in his hands, I sat to the left of Jake and took both of this hands into my own. He looked up and I wiped away the tear that threatened to fall, my phone started buzzing so I took mine out and gave Jake his. I looked at it and realised that it was Tony, Jakes phone started going off and Chance was calling him. We both took a deep breath each and answered, I could slightly hear some of Jakes conversation with Chance and Jake could hear mine and Tony\\'s. In Call: A- yo, where are you guys? We all have no idea where you are, you guys said that you would be here by 1 and it\\'s 2... Rik: something came up Tony and tell Chance that Jake isn\\'t comfortable talking about it yet. A- okay, just where are you? At least tell us so we know what to expect if you guys come here... Rik: we are at the hospital... and that\\'s all I\\'m saying Tony, no we are all fine! A- o-okay... if you want us to go up there just let us know before okay? Rik: sure! Bye bro... A- bye sis... End of call... I looked to my right to see that Jake was still talking to Chance but Logan was gone? I looked at Jake and he shrugged before sighing and ending the call, he put his phone down and looked at me with a small smile. I pecked his lips and leaned my head on his shoulder and waited for news on his dad, I knew Jake rested his head on mine but I didn\\'t care. I saw Logan briefly before he got stopped by someone, the voice was too familiar to be true and that\\'s because it was my dad. I got up and Jake did as well, we walked towards him and he sympathetically smiled at us. Dan- any news on him? L- nope, he went into cardiac arrest so we still don\\'t know how he is... Dan- can\\'t you only go into cardiac arrest if you wake up from a coma... J- yep.. *whispered* Dan- I\\'m sorry guys that you have to deal with this... JL- we knew it was gonna happen... *whispered* DanRik: what? L- he was under too much stress and was angry with our mom... J- y-yep... Dan went up to Jake and held him as he cried into him, my mom soon arrived after and hugged Logan. We were all waiting for an update on Greg, Jake had fell asleep in Dan\\'s embrace and Logan was on his phone. The doctor came out and saw that Jake was asleep, he looked at Jake sympathetically before pulling me and my mom aside. (Doctor/ Dr.) Dr- okay so he\\'s stable and looks like he\\'ll pull through but we just need to know what went on in his life... I explained everything to the Doctor and he then took another glance at Jake and Logan before leaving and then we explained to Dan and Logan what he said. Rik: he said that Greg was stable and that he might pull through... L- that\\'s amazing! Dan- I\\'m glad! Angel: how is Jake? Dan- he\\'s out, I was thinking of taking him back and Logan you could come as well and then get changed and all that... L- thanks! I\\'ll do that... Rik: I wanna stay here incase... Angel: me too, just incase anything happens we wanna be able to update you guys! DanL- okay, we\\'ll see you guys in a bit! AngelRik: see ya! They left and we sat down, I was busy thinking at how I\\'ve had a whirlwind of 24 hours! Jakes PoV: I woke up at my house? Was all that shit that my dad was back in the hospital a dream? I couldn\\'t think straight and then my eyes started to focus, I walked downstairs and saw Dan and Logan. I yawned and walked downstairs, I ended up almost falling because my ankle gave up half way through and Logan had to run to my side. He helped me down the stairs and sat me on the couch, I sighed and leaned my head on his shoulder. L- how do you feel Jake?? J- I don\\'t know, my head kills and I can\\'t think straight... L- it\\'s gonna be alright Jaker... do you wanna move up to LA sooner to escape?? J- p-please... when can we go? L- how about next month? You can go to your Prom, tailgate party and shit then we can leave for awhile and then Erika could come up as well and then we could fly back so your kid could be born in Ohio... (A/N: I\\'m so sorry that A) I haven\\'t been editing that much and B) that I didn\\'t mention that Greg got transferred to Albuquerque General... also I\\'ll be making a separate part about that. Please enjoy this chapter as it will be my last for awhile and I think I might start a new story to make this a 3 Book series... maybe my next book will be about their old lives in Ohio and then the last one will be a reunion type of one! Sorry if you had to read this entire thing️. ) J- that would be amazing! Thanks Logey! L- I kind of all ready set it up as well... and then you can go and live in the house Nick set up for you guys! J- okay... I fell back asleep and dreamt about my life, this continuous nightmare. I didn\\'t even realise it but soon I was dreaming about Ohio and when my mom sent me and Logan to stay with our dad for a bit, I completely forgot to say that they\\'ve been arguing for years now and that our Dad has a spare house incase him and mom got into a fight. Flashback *3 years ago: I was eating cereal with Logan at the table and then our Dad walked in, he smiled at us and Logan smiled back before leaving to get ready for school. My dad started talking to me and before long I was explaining everything to him and he just held me, I loved my dad and hated my mom. She would always care about Logan and have his best interests at heart whereas my dad would have both of ours and have an even mind, although we saw our mom more I never had that special bond with her. Logan has that with Mom and I have that bond with our dad, the door bell rang and my dad answered. In came Chance, Tony, Kade, Nick, Ivan, Emilio, Nathan and Chad, I put up a fake smile and greeted them. Logan then came down and said hi then left, Chance and Tony could see straight through the smile and shared a concerned look at me. Ch- yo, you ready bro? J- totally! *clenches fists under the table* A- so, hows life Mr. Paul? Gr- Tony, I\\'ve told you one too many times. Call me Greg! A- sorry Greg... Gr- I\\'m glad that you boys are looking out for Jake... he needs it and I know about everything at school. Ka- okay, it\\'s fine anyway he\\'s our friend we would never hurt him! Although I loved them as brothers they couldn\\'t do anything to like get rid of this pain, as my dad started talking to them about it I dug my nails into the palms of my hands until they bled. I wiped the blood on my black shorts and did it again, somehow they never noticed the blood but I was extremely thankful for that. After my dad mentioned the Alissa drama I stood up and removed myself from the conversation, it was way too uncomfortable and overwhelming to go back in there. Alissa was my ex and she put me in very uncomfortable positions and it really affected me mentally and physically, Physically as I was working out more and because quite uptight about changing in the guys locker rooms and Mentally as it made me become insecure and have trust issues. She was the main reason why I had such a troubled life. I heard my dad say \"Shit\" before coming and apologising to me and I shrugged my shoulders. He then noticed my hands, Fuck... Gr- Jake... did I make you do that?? I shook my head No and took my gaze to my shoes instead. I heard him sigh and he pulled me into a hug, Chance and Tony soon came and I showed them my hands. Tony pulled me into a hug and we stayed like that awhile, my dad rubbed my back and then I pulled away and left. We all left for school and man I was gonna end up with a mess like what happened on my hands earlier, by the end of the day... Jakes palms (Ik it\\'s from Riverdale but pretend it\\'s Jakes hands and that it\\'s a lot worse like there\\'s blood around it): We got to school and I saw Erika and the other girls, they came over and we all walked into the gates. I went to my locker and the squad followed, everyone except Erika left as hers was right next to mine. As I was putting a book in my locker I got thrown into the wall and my head had got caught on the door so now the side of my head was bleeding freely, I got a quick glimpse of who it was before Logan came over and everyone got scared. L- Jake, who did that? I stared at my bully before looking at Logan and staying quiet for a bit. J- these guys accidentally got pushed and I hit my head, that\\'s all that happened Logan... He left and then my bully came up to me. Dave- bro, why would you cover for me? I\\'ve been a dick to you for the entire year! J- I\\'m not a snitch... Me and Erika walked away and she held my hand, immediately after she pulled her hand away and saw the blood on her hand. I got pulled into an empty classroom and she made me show her my hands, she gasped and had tears forming in her eyes. Rik: Jake... why?... J- my life is the worst! I hate it! I hate being here! I hate everything and most people except you and the squad... *wipes tears from eyes* I cant be here anymore Erika and me hurting myself is my way of feeling the pain I\\'ve caused my family... they would all prefer it if I wasn\\'t here... Rik: please, please stay with me... I can\\'t stand seeing your smile fade, we all don\\'t want to see you crash and burn... *kisses his cheek* J- Erika... you keep me going, we have this thing that I don\\'t wanna ruin and so maybe would you be my girlfriend... Rik: of course! I will do anything to put a smile on your face and see you enjoying life! She put her arms around my neck and pecked my lips before cleaning her hands and cleaning mine, we then continued to walk around the school holding hands and when the bell rang we managed to get everyone to walk out. We all went to the bleachers and I showed them my hands, all the girls except Erika gasped as the majority of the guys did as well. Chance put his arm around my shoulders and then our Coach approached us and then I realised that this was Logan\\'s practise... ??- what are you kids doing here? Shouldn\\'t you guys be in class!? L- I\\'ll handle it Coach, it\\'s my brother and his mates... *panting from running up there* He nodded and then Logan sat down and asked why we were there... L- guys, why aren\\'t you in class? Jake? Why? J- because we don\\'t give two shits and you\\'ve only came over here to talk to me because we are interrupting your practise! Ch- let\\'s go! I can\\'t stand this! We got up and then Logan yanked on my arm, I stared at him and pulled my arm away. L- talk to me, I\\'m worried... J- y-you shouldn\\'t be, nothing\\'s wrong... L- what\\'s up with your palms, Jake? J- NOTHING! *snaps* L- their beet red... please talk to me... J- uhhhh... I-I...g-gotta go... With that we left and Logan kept on calling my name, I sighed and leaned my head against the wall. Suddenly Logan\\'s football team came running over and as I was close with most of them they acted like big brothers to me, one pulled me into a hug and another rubbed my back. Ge- Jake... talk to us if you aren\\'t gonna talk to Logan... J- CAN EVERYONE LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!*pauses for a couple seconds* DO YOU KNOW WHAT FINE I\\'LL GOD DAMN TALK! I FUCKING HATE MY LIFE! I WANNA BE DEAD! I DON\\'T WANNA BE HERE! Ma- Jake... come here... *pulls Jake into a hug* Ge- someone get Logan... Chanthony- that will make it worse... Ma- why Jake? Why? *pulls away* J- A) everyone would prefer it and B) I just don\\'t wanna be here anymore! I can\\'t stand seeing faces that have hurt me even if it\\'s in the past! *wipes eyes* Ma- what makes you think that Jake?? Ka- do you want us to say it Jake? J- also explain the Alissa situation please... Te: okay... Rik: let\\'s explain the Alissa situation as well... when Jake was dating her she was extremely abusive to Jake... he would always end up with a cut, bruise or even stab wound... she then cheated on him countless times... Jake tried breaking up with her billions of times but each time he did... it lead to a punishment... the worst one he\\'s had is where Alissa stopped him from eating for an entire month... the most he had was an apple because he needed to live... there were multiple knives in his room and then he would have double the amount of cuts on his body... Ka- and then Jake walked in on her and Logan because she was certain that Jake was cheating on her... after that Jake tried s-u-i-c-i-d-e... *pausing after each letter and getting quieter* The football team gasped and I stayed quiet, I wanted to die and they had to realise that! Chance then came up to me and hugged me, that\\'s when I started crying into his chest... A- j-jake has also been getting bullied for a couple years now... that\\'s when the... Ma- what started??? X except JChanthony- cutting started... We all stayed in a comfortable silence until Logan and their coach came, once Logan looked at my face he immediately asked what happened... L- Jaker... what\\'s up? Please talk to me... J- no i don\\'t wanna talk Logan! YOU\\'RE ONLY CARING AS YOU WANT TO PRACTISE! IF I WAS TRULY UPSET YOU WOULD\\'NT GIVE TWO FLYING FUCKS! SO GO AHEAD, ACT LIKE YOU CARE NOW CAUSE I KNOW THAT ITS A FUCKING ACT! I walked away and then Principal Elks arrived, me and the \"golden boys\" walked past her and that left the girls to deal with that. Erika came running at me and hugged me, she wiped a stray tear away from my eyes and kissed my lips. I kissed back and we pulled away after awhile, she wrapped her arms around my neck and pecked my lips again. I smiled quickly but that soon faded when I saw Alissa come and kiss Logan square on the lips. Logan then pulled away and smiled evilly at me, Erika then made me look at her and reassured me that everything would be fine. The squad walked away and we all walked straight out of the school and went to our houses, I went straight to my moms and cried in my bedroom. I had previously locked the door and started punching the wall, I didn\\'t stop when I heard the front door slam open, I didn\\'t stop when I heard someone shout my name, I didn\\'t even stop when they started banging on my door. I stopped once they broke my door lock and grabbed hold of me, somehow I got out of their hold and started punching the wall again. They tried to refrain me from it but I only stopped once I made a hole and my knuckle had started bleeding, I didn\\'t even realise who pulled me away. All I knew was that every word that they said I couldn\\'t hear, I was too focused on what I wanted to do. Ch- JAKE! STOP! JAKE STOP IT, YOU\\'RE GONNA HURT YOURSELF! A- GRAB HIM AND HOLD HIM! They then grabbed me again and then I collapsed to the floor in tears for no apparent reason. I felt arms wrap around me and soon enough Chance was holding me, I cried into the crook of his neck and Tony rubbed my back. A- Jake? J- I WANNA FUCKING DIE! I DONT WANNA BE HERE ANYMORE! I CANT STAND THIS LIFE IM LIVING! Ch- Please calm down Jake! J- NO EVERYONE FUCKING HASSLES ME ABOUT TALKING SO I AM! I WILL KILL MYSELF RIGHT NOW IF THEY FUCKING WANT! Ch- you can\\'t Jake! EVERYONE CARES ABOUT YOU! J- REALLY THEN WHY WAS I IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH ALISSA, WHY ARE MY PARENTS BLAMING ME FOR THEIR ARGUMENTS! WHY DID ALISSA CHEAT ON ME WITH LOGAN? WHY AM I GETTING FUCKING HATED! BET YOU CANT ANSWER THAT SHIT CAN YOU? A- Please Jake, stop! *wipes eyes* J- do you know what? Fuck this! Fuck life! Where\\'s a fucking knife I\\'m ending this shit once and for all! I walked out of Chances embrace and fount a knife downstairs, I brought it upstairs and locked my bathroom door. I brought the knife up to my forearm and sliced the entire length down it, I did the same on the other arm then on my legs. The bangs I was hearing started to fade as did the world around me, soon enough it was complete darkness... End of flashback... I was woken up to Logan shaking the crap out of me, I looked at him and he hugged me. Dan started rubbing my back and then they both explained what happened. Dan- you were having a nightmare, Jake. You started shaking and we tried waking you up but you didn\\'t. L- what were you dreaming about Jaker? J- g-get the fuck away from me... *whispered and backed away* L- Jake?... are you okay? Dan- he\\'s having a panic attack... J- get the fuck away from me... *whispered over and over again* L- look at me Jake... look at me... J- n-no... I-I can\\'t be here... I don\\'t deserve to be here... *whispered* Dan- Jake... Erika is on her way... J- I-I don\\'t deserve to be here... *whispered over and over again* L- stop saying that Jake... you deserve to be here... J- I-I don\\'t... Everyone in Ohio was right *starts breathing heavily* Dan- Jake... you are having a panic attack... it\\'s alright buddy... J- I can\\'t be here... I can\\'t be here... I can\\'t be here... I cant be here... Erika soon arrived and looked at Logan and me before going to my front and kneeling down in front of me. Rik: baby... look at me... J- I-I don\\'t deserve to be here... I don\\'t wanna be here... *tears streaming down his face* Rik: it\\'s just a panic attack... calm down please... J- I-I don\\'t deserve to be here... l-leave me alone... Angel: Jake... Dan rub his back! Dan started rubbing my back and Erika grabbed my hands and held them, Logan was busy getting me a cup of water. Erika kissed my forehead and reassured me that it was a nightmare, she wiped away the tears on my face before holding me. After awhile I calmed down and me and Erika got snuggled up, Dan, Angel and Logan were all around us. L- Jake... are you okay?... J- I-I don\\'t wanna talk about it... *whispered* Angel: you need to Jake... it will help you... Dan- Jake... we all care about you... we\\'re only doing this because we care... J- I-I had a n-nightmare about... o-Ohio... L- what about Ohio?... J- t-the time I t-tried... Rik: I\\'m so sorry Jake... b-but your d-dad... *wipes tears from eyes* L- what happened?... *whispered* Angel: he-he won\\'t make it to meet your baby as he\\'s... um... J- he\\'s dead isn\\'t he?... Erika nodded and I broke down into tears, the Costell\\'s stayed with us for a while before our mom finally came home and David was with her. Although we were only 18 Erika had offered to let me live with them as David was back, Logan was getting sent off to college so I wouldn\\'t really have anyone to live with. I agreed and then moved in with them, tomorrow was mine and Erika\\'s first ultrasound and I couldn\\'t wait. I snuggled up next to her on her bed and fell asleep holding her.'][Chapter 19] ['Dans PoV (switched up on ya didn\\'t I?️): Me and Angel were talking about Jake... we felt really bad for the boy, his childhood had been ripped in half... Ohio started it and Albuquerque ended it, we knew that he was struggling to let go of Ohio so we set something up. His old friends from Ohio were flying out to see him, we heard someone walk downstairs and saw that Erika was still awake. Angel: we thought that you\\'d be asleep because tomorrow you get to hear your baby\\'s heartbeat for the first time! Rik: I was hungry, anyway Jakes asleep for the first time in like months... Dan- we\\'ve got a surprise for him just don\\'t tell him please... Rik: I won\\'t, don\\'t worry... Angel: we feel so bad for Jake... his life\\'s been torn in two and he can\\'t do anything about it! Rik: I feel the same way! Also when we go up to LA like a few months before we have the baby we are flying back to Ohio so our kid can say that he/she was born in Ohio... Dan- okay, I\\'ll fly back with you guys... I need to check on everyone else anyway... Angel: we\\'ve got a plane to catch in 3 days so we will all have to do something! Rik: I\\'m gonna miss you guys soooooo much! Let\\'s have a massive dinner with the entire squad! I\\'ll talk to Jake about it as his house is the biggest out of the group... AngelDan- that\\'s true! Also, how\\'s Jake after saying goodbye to his dad? *whispered* Rik: hurting, I\\'m making sure that he doesn\\'t do anything stupid though and since David is now living with them again I don\\'t want Jake going back to the old old Jake... Me and Angel nodded then we heard this sort of scream, Dani, JC and our cousin Lauren flew back to Ohio so we knew that it was Jake. Erika ran to her room and we followed, when we got in there we saw Jake shaking and breathing heavily. Erika had tears in her eyes as she woke Jake up and he started crying, we rubbed his back and he apologised for that. J- s-sorry about t-that... *mumbled* Angel: it\\'s okay, Jake. You couldn\\'t help it, the day you left Ohio, Erika couldn\\'t sleep and she ended up having nightmares like this... Rik: it\\'s okay Jake... *kisses his cheek* He smiled and we wanted to find out what happened. Dan- Jake... what happened? J- O-Ohio... u-ummm... Angel: hey shushhh... it\\'s okay... you don\\'t need to tell us now, tell us in the morning! Jake nodded and we hugged him before going downstairs, my phone went off and I saw that it was Jakes friends from Vine. Amanda Cerny, Dobre Twins, Curtis Lepore, Lele Pons and the Dolan Twins. They had told me that they had landed and that they were coming over tomorrow, as tomorrow was our proper day before packing we decided to ask Pam if we could have a party tomorrow, well dinner, so we could say goodbye and all that. She agreed so we sent them the address and told them that we\\'d text them when to come over, we went to bed and I thought about how life can be the best at times but then the worst. Jakes PoV: After my little panic attack I fell back asleep with Erika in my arms, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw Angel on the couch. I went over to her and I guess I startled her because it looked like she was gonna have a heart attack. J- hey... *whispered* She smiled and motioned me over to her, I sat down and she was looking at the ultrasound pictures of when she was pregnant with Erika. Angel: Jake... how have you been dealing with stress? J- ummm... what do you mean? Angel: you had tons of pressure back in Ohio, how did you cope with it? J- I started digging my nails into the palms of my hands without me noticing and then it turned into a habit when me and Alissa broke up... Angel: I didn\\'t mean to bring that up, sorry Jake... I shrugged and said... J- it\\'s fine, anyway the same day that I started turning it into a habit was the day I asked Erika out and she said yes! So technically it was an alright day! *smiles* Angel: Erika\\'s lucky to have you in her life! You are such a nice, caring, understanding human being! J- You\\'re lucky to have Dan in your life as he\\'s such a protective and likeable guy! We smiled at each other before I realised that mine and Deji\\'s fight had been postponed due to me ending up in the hospital, it was now happening on August 25th... we had all become quite famous on YouTube so we declared it as the biggest internet event in history, mine and Logan\\'s press conference with them was coming up and if Deji or KSI mentioned anything about Erika I would literally kill them both! Angel: what\\'cha thinking bout Jake? J- mine and Deji\\'s fight and then Logan\\'s and JJ\\'s fight. Angel: oh, you\\'re gonna win *chuckles slightly* J- thanks... I-I need to get this off of my chest because it\\'s like how I\\'m gonna start dealing with stress and pressure, I\\'m not gonna hurt myself because of it now! Angel: I\\'ll be here to listen Jake... J- I feel like shit, I\\'m being treated like shit by my \"Step Dad\". Erika could do so much better then someone who has tried to die too many times, I feel like I don\\'t belong here, I feel... I feel like the world would be better without me in it... *wipes tears from eyes* I-I still haven\\'t gotten over the fucking car crash because it haunts me! Each time I hear someone mention it, I get so like defensive and it pops back into my head. I hate all the hate I\\'m getting, at times I wish I listen to them but I don\\'t wanna... Angel: you ever need to talk I\\'m here Jake... *smiles* I smiled back and yawned, I was too tired to walk back to Erika\\'s room so I ended up asleep on their couch. Angel had gone back upstairs and put a blanket over me. Erika\\'s PoV: I woke up at around 8:30am as did Mom and Dad, when I woke up Jake wasn\\'t with me. I frowned, I walked downstairs and saw Jake passed out on the couch with Dan and Angel making breakfast in the kitchen. I kissed his forehead before walking into the kitchen and eating, after an hour Jake woke up and slid his arms around my waist. I turned around and kissed him on the lips, Jake kissed back and then left to get changed. When he came back down I forced him to eat, which he thankfully did, before we left to hear our baby\\'s heartbeat for the first time! We insisted on a home birth because in Ohio you couldn\\'t really have a baby in a hospital safely and we convinced them to let us have the baby in Ohio! using RomanAtwood as a base for this until the baby is either here or as a miscarriage* As I listened to the heart beating strongly I had this massive smile plastered over my face, I looked over at Jake and noticed that he had tears in his eyes. We smiled at each other and when we left we sat in the car for awhile and cried, we were so happy! We then went back to mine and showed my mom and dad the pictures from the sonogram, they both awww\\'d then told us to change because we were going to have dinner at Jakes. Jakes Outfit: My outfit: We came down hand in hand and saw that Dan had changed as well, we all left as a \"family\" and arrived at Jakes. Jake walked in and I followed, I then saw Amanda Cerny, the Dobre Twins, Curtis Lepore, LeLe Pons and the Dolan Twins. Jake looked so shocked and they hugged him, Marcus, Lucas, Grayson, Ethan and Curtis went outside to talk whilst I showed everyone the sonogram pictures! Lucas\\' PoV: As me, Marcus, Curtis, Lele, Ethan, Grayson and Curtis arrived we got out and said hi to each other as we all had separate flights and hadn\\'t seen each other in ages! (Lu= Lucas, Mar= Marcus, Le= Lele, Cu= Curtis, Gra= Grayson, Eth= Ethan, Am= Amanda) Am: OMGGGG!! HEY LELE! *squeals and hugs Lele* Le: HEY MANDIE! IVE MISSED YOU! .*squeals and hugs Amanda* Lu- what up G\\'s? *fist bumps the guys* Eth- yo! Can\\'t wait to see Chance and Toner again! Gra- same! It was so funny last time! Mar- I doubt Jake will be here till later otherwise why would they call us over here earlier? And plus Jakes motorbike is gone... We walked in and was greeted by everyone, they all looked surprise and we saw this new group of people merged with the \"Squad\" from Ohio. T- hey... you guys are Jakes friends from Vine right? Dobre Twins- yep! Lu- I\\'m Lucas! *waves* Mar- and I\\'m Marcus! *waves as well* Am: I\\'m Amanda Cerny! Le: I\\'m Lele Pons Cu- and I\\'m Curtis Lepore! Dobre Twins- the Dolan Twins are around here somewhere! T- well, I\\'m Troy Bolton! C- I\\'m Chad Danforth Ta: I\\'m Taylor McKessie! G: I\\'m Gabriella Montez! R- I\\'m Ryan Evans! S: I\\'m Sharpay Evans! T- there are way too many Twins in this place now... *laughs* G: we also have... Kelsi Nielsen, Martha Cox, Zeke Baylor and Jason Cross! Lu- ok! So who\\'s the bitch of the group now that Alissa isn\\'t in it? X except Dobre, Lele, Amanda, Curtis, Dolan and Sharpay- SHARPAY! Mar- and who\\'s dating who, we just wanna know so then it makes it easier on us! G: me and Troy are dating! Chaylor- WE ARE TOGETHER! Troyella: I thought you hated this thing! *waits a second* well crap it\\'s back! S: I\\'m dating Zeke! K: I\\'m dating Ryan! Ma: I\\'m dating Jason! Chad- well I guess we should explain our couples! Chalex: we are together! Tanthony- we are together! Chunny- we are the third wheels! Chanthony- JERIKA IS REAL! Made: we are dating! Nelly: we are also dating! Martinez- we single! Ch- and Nick is gay L- let me enlighten you guys with some disturbing knowledge about my relationship status! I hooked up with Alissa, we are still dating somehow although she caused my brother so much pain! I \"cheated\" on Chloe Bennett with her so idk... Eth- LOGAN! Gra- ALEXANDER! Dolan- PAUL! They tackled Logan and soon enough Jake walks in and looks shocked, we hug him and then Erika walks in with a massive smile on her face. Rik: Dad... this is what you meant by a surprise! J- you did this Dan?! omg... I-I am literally speechless right now I missed you guys so much! Dan- we needed to turn your attention somewhere other then the stress you\\'ve been under so I got these guys up here... J- thanks so much! *hugs dan* He smiled and then Erika hugged Amanda and Lele, Jake came over to us again and took a photo. We all ate and was enjoying it when we decided to put on our old vines! We all laughed and then we spoke to Jake outside... Cu- Jake... Dan told us about the anxiety and stress thing... J- o-okay?... Lu- did Alissa cause it?... J- m-maybe... it\\'s complicated... I don\\'t really wanna get into why but believe me I\\'ve spoken to people about it! Mar- Neels has started again... J- why? *tenses* Lu- he\\'s coming up here to beat your ass apparently... *shrugs* J- for fucks sake... why can\\'t people just leave me the fuck alone! I\\'m already hated as it is on the Internet I don\\'t need this shit as well! *growls* Mar- we are up here for a couple months and Neels said that he\\'d be up here in a month so we can back you up! J- thanks guys! *smiles* Lu- we need to tell everyone that Neels is coming back, Jake... J- let\\'s do it... We walked back in and Jake announced it... J- NEELS VISSER IS COMING TO \"BEAT MY ASS\" APPARENTLY! *laughs* A- that scrawny bitch won\\'t even touch you! Ch- he\\'s such a pussy! Not as much as Deji but he still is one! J- got that fucking right! P: language! Their is a 3 year old in the house! J- really... you\\'re playing that card *laughs* L- to add to my collection of Jakes fights can I film it? *laughs* J- please do! It can be a meme *laughs at the thought* A- wanna teach him the Ohio way? Ch- haven\\'t done that in awhile! *smirks* J- he\\'s gonna get an Ohio beat down! *smirks* P: oh no you aren\\'t! He\\'s still a human being guys! J- did you not hear what I said? He wants to \"beat my ass\"! A- sorry Pam, but whether you like it or not he\\'s getting an Ohioan beat down! Rik: make sure to get him back for everything guys! Ohio Trio- Will fucking do! *all smirk* P: I will not stand behind you Jake! I cross the line at beating him up! Remember last time? J- he deserved it! And he hasn\\'t learnt his lesson but I\\'ll go a little bit nicer on him as I almost killed him! Brad- Tony, can I film this as well? *laughs* A- SURE! Send it to me afterwards, Logan get a completely different angle of it so then I can get two perspectives of it! Gr- hey Jake, you\\'ve got a special guest... Deji walked in and we stared at them both wide-eyed. J- why are you here wedgie? Care to get slapped again *smirked* Deji- what you saying bitch? What you saying bitch! Jake then got up and Chance and Tony held him back, that wasn\\'t enough as he managed to get his hand to collide with his cheek. Deji\\'s team started shouting \"He just fucking chinned him\" they backed Jake away and then they called him a pussy. ???- YOU NEED 15 PEOPLE AND THATS A COMPLIMENT! THATS A COMPLIMENT! J- and stay out, STAY OUT! L- WHATS UP BITCH? WHATS UP DEJI?! Deji- I HOPE YOU HIT HARDER THEN THAT! I HOPE YOU HIT HARDER THEN THAT! They left and the hype over Jake slapping Deji got to both him and Logan. J- GET SLAPPED LIKE A BITCH!! L- WHATS UP BITCH? WHATS UP BITCH! J- IT\\'S ON SITE MOTHERFUCKER! Erika ran up to Jake and tried calming him down, Logan was calming down but Jake wasn\\'t. We all could see it in his eyes that he was pissed, Erika grabbed his hands and kissed his forehead. Rik: please calm down... *whispered and kisses cheek* J- He\\'s fucking pissed me off... *whispered* Rik: for me and the child, please... *whispered* J- fine, but I\\'ll get rid of this anger on Neels *smirks* Rik: Jake... you would end up killing him so cool off before anymore fights please... J- fine... whatever... *rolls eyes* Jakes PoV: The minute Deji walked in I knew that i needed to hit him, Deji had been chatting so much bullshit about mine and Erika\\'s relationship and was explaining mine and Alissa\\'s relationship on top of that. It gave me this new anger that I couldn\\'t control, I couldn\\'t control me slapping Deji. I couldn\\'t control the crowd that pulled me back, I couldn\\'t control the demon inside. When Erika tried calming me down it didn\\'t work until I tried and it helped, she kissed my forehead and took my hand. She brought me to the couch and sat me on it with her on my lap, Erika laid sideways in my lap so she could put her head in the crook of my neck. We all were talking to each other when Alissa started texting me, I was so confused and so was Erika. In Chat: AbusivePerson: watch your back Jakey, a snake is on the loose! JakePaul: what do you want? AbusivePerson: Snakey Paul slapped my best friend and I wouldn\\'t find out?! That\\'s right me and Deji are best friends, bitch JakePaul: so? Where am I in this equation? AbusivePerson: you hurt him, I hurt you... JakePaul: are you serious right now? You\\'re gonna put me through that torture again? I cant with this! AbusivePerson: hehehehehe... bye Jakey!️ End of Chat Erika stared at me and I stared at her, Alissa was threatening to abuse me... great... Erika kissed my cheek and smiled at me, I smiled back and we eventually fell asleep in each other\\'s arms. Flashback/dream: I was round Alissa\\'s and that\\'s when she started hitting me, I sat on her bed and she came over with a belt and started hitting me. I was so confused but didn\\'t question it as we were only in the 4th grade. (A/N: I know it\\'s a low grade but it just seems like he\\'s had to deal with it for years up until he was 15, also don\\'t question me if I get the grades wrong and all that I live in the UK and we have years like Year 8 etc. So please don\\'t judge as I\\'m trying my best.) She smiled evilly at me and then started kissing me as she took my shirt off, I kissed back and although we were only in the 4th Grade we meant it. Alissa threw my shirt on the floor and then pulled out a knife, only me and Alissa were there so all the screams I made didn\\'t matter. Her parents were out of town for the week and so I was staying with her, when she finished ripping my skin pretty much I could barely breathe. My heart rate increased as she sat down next to me and put her hand over my abs, they were bleeding freely and were bruising. I stared at Alissa before cleaning myself up and getting changed for bed, Alissa leaned into me and we fell asleep in each other\\'s arms. End of Flashback/dream: I woke up in Erika\\'s House, she wasn\\'t in my arms so I got up and walked downstairs. She hadn\\'t noticed me so I went behind her and slipped my hands around her waist, Dan looked at me and smiled before continuing to read the paper. Rik: someone\\'s finally awake! *jokes and faces Jake* J- what do you mean? Rik: we tried waking you up but you didn\\'t so we put you to bed last night and now it\\'s like 12:30pm so you, sleepy head, slept for ages! J- i... *yawns* was... *yawns* exhausted... *fake yawns* Rik: awwww... ily! *pecks his lips and laughs* J- ily2! *pecks her lips and laughs* Dan- so how was it listening to your baby\\'s heartbeat for the first time? Jerika: we cried! Dan- your mom did the same thing with you Erika! Rik: awwwww! *smiles* Dan- we\\'ve gotta go pack, make sure Tessa and Sunny are also here as you all bought this house! J- does that mean that they can technically become like my actual baby sisters? *laughs* Rik: if you want? I\\'ll talk to them about it when they come over! J- where were they staying again? Rik: Tessa stayed with Tony and Sunny went round Mack\\'s. J- okay... wait if they live here then does that mean I have to deal with Karaoke? Rik: I mean we have to cope with you so yes! *jokes with Jake and laughs* J- oh god... this will be interesting... *fakes sarcasm and laughs* Tessa and Sunny arrived and unpacked, we all smiled and Dan and Angel went to the hotel they were gonna stay in for the night. We all sat in the lounge and were talking, Erika then remembered what I asked her earlier. Rik: okay so now that Jake lives with us, what about if he becomes like your actual big brother. Like he\\'ll be the one who comforts you when either Tony or anyone else can\\'t, he\\'s the one you can trust as if I\\'m gonna be your big sister then he might have to be your big bro?... Tunny: YESSSSS! PLEASE BE OUR BIG BROTHER JAKE! J- it was my idea to be your older bro so of course I will! Anyway, Logan won\\'t be one as he ain\\'t in the group and has gone back to College. Te: okay, so now that we have an older brother what do you wanna do? J- I think I know that Erika and Sunny wanna do but I ain\\'t gonna say it incase I\\'m wrong... Rik: well I wanna do... J- KARAOKE! *mocks Erika* Rik: geez, I wonder how you knew that? *plays dumb* J- Sunny, did you also wanna do that? Su: One Hundred Percent! J- R.I.P ME! Te: omg...*laughs* J- I\\'m gonna text in the group chat cuz I\\'m bored! Rik: do Karaoke with us please! Te: wait, will me and Sunny have to listen to you two doing it? Jerika: No J- we\\'ve only done it once and it was a special moment, plus we can\\'t really cause of the baby! Su: I forgot about that *laughs* J- did you really forget that she was pregnant? *chuckles softly* Su: No, that you\\'ve only done it once *laughs again* Rik: Moving on... we want you both to be our god mothers of our baby! Tunny: REALLY?! *squeals* Jerika: yep! Rik: You\\'ll be around the most plus you were my first friends at WestLake and you were Jakes first girl best friends so it makes sense! J- you both broke the barrier between me and trusting girls again! If it weren\\'t for you guys then this little baby wouldn\\'t exist and me and Erika never would have dated! Su: thanks so much! Who are the god fathers gonna be? Jerika: Chanthony! Rik: it only makes sense as they\\'ve been the only people Jake trusted before we all made the group! And plus they are like brothers to me! Te: did you tell them earlier? Jerika: *nods* yep... Su: THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!! J- for you maybe, I slept the day away! *laughs* Rik: he woke up at 12:30 then ate then went back to sleep and I helped my parents pack! Te: wow... you are literally Tony *laughs* J- well we did grow up together! Rik: Jake, as they are your SISTERS now you should tell them about the texts... Tunny: what? J- Alissa threatened me... she said that because I slapped Deji she\\'s gonna \"hurt\" me... *looks down* Te: Jake... that\\'s awful! *shakes her head and hugs Jake* Su: let me join this hug *joins the hug* Rik: I might as well... *kisses Jakes cheek and hugs him* Te: her and Logan are still together! And Logan owes you after everything he\\'s put you through! Su: that\\'s right! And if you get him to cheat on Alissa... J- she can taste her own medicine but... Rik: if she hurts you set a camera up and film it, send it to Logan and then he can break up with her! J- I\\'m in! Te: I\\'ll get Logan on FaceTime! Su: I\\'ll connect your phone to the TV! In call: Logan: yo! It\\'s nice to see you guys! But why are you calling? Jake: Alissa threatened me... Logan: what? Why? Jake: she said that because I hurt Deji she\\'s gonna hurt me! And you remember how extreme it can get... Rik: we\\'ve got this plan, well we\\'ve got two, A) you cheat on her with Chloe then break up with her or B) if Alissa try\\'s to hurt Jake, we film it and send it to you to use against her... then you break up with her... Logan: Erika, aren\\'t you and Alissa on good terms now? Rik: I completely forgot about that! We are! Logan: I\\'ll do the break up part if Tessa and Sunny get closer to Alissa! Jake: so they can find out what she\\'s gonna do and if they start acting like they hate me then it would be more believable! Guys, his plan could work ONLY if you both start to hate me... Rik: he\\'s right... we won\\'t hate you but we\\'ll just have to act like that when she\\'s around and we can\\'t post about this on social media and like that so me and Jake can act as if you hate us and then you act as if you actually do to make it believable! Make it seem like Jake is cheating on me with Mackenzie and then say you tried warning me about it! Logan: I\\'ll get Made on board so then Kade won\\'t try and kill Jake! Tessa: you guys should flirt when it\\'s just you, me, and the gang and when Alissa\\'s around you flirt with both Erika and Mackenzie! Logan: I\\'ve gotta go, we will finish this later okay? Jake: see ya bro... *sighs* End of call. I sighed again and went upstairs, I changed and then fell asleep on Erika\\'s bed.'][Chapter 20] ['Erika\\'s PoV: It had been a couple months since we listened to our baby\\'s heartbeat for the first time and it was amazing! We decided to do the plan around now as Alissa hadn\\'t been either in Albuquerque or in school. Jake had become so quiet and stressed that he barely noticed us and was too angry at times, me, Tessa and Sunny had confided in Logan and he\\'s been trying to talk to Jake but he\\'s been so stressed and paranoid that it makes it difficult for us. Me, Sunny and Tessa were all downstairs eating breakfast when Jake walked down and had his hood over his head, I went up to him and kissed him. Jake kissed back and I saw the stress in his eyes when we pulled away, I held both of his hands and smiled. He smiled back and then walked away to get food; that was progress! We made progress! Logan was coming over today to talk to us and as Tessa and Sunny were gonna be at East High we promised to film it and send it to them. Su: JAKEY! *runs and hugs Jake* J- SUNNY! T! *hugs her back* Te: finally talking to us now... *rolls eyes* Rik: Tessa... J- nah, it\\'s fine. Im stressed and I can\\'t think straight, basically what I\\'m asking is if you would forgive me because I\\'ve been working on something! *smirks* Rik: oh god... *laughs* Te: I\\'ll forgive you! Good to have you back, Pizzy Paul! *laughs* J- good to be back, T! Tessa hugged Jake and then we all sat down and were talking, it was so good to see the old Jake! The bump was showing and so the paparazzi, who followed us around now that Jake was famous, made sure to get exclusive information about it. We knew our gender and to be honest me and Jake would have been thrilled with either, we weren\\'t entirely picky with it as we were gonna have a child and that\\'s all that mattered. Jakes PoV: I had been working on not only the best proposal ever but the baby room for our kid! Erika knew that I would have done something to do with the baby but what she doesn\\'t know is that I\\'m gonna propose to her when she sees it, Tessa and Sunny are in on it and have been going along with it. The reason Tessa reacted like that when I was hugging Sunny is to make it more realistic as if I wasn\\'t speaking to them either when in reality I was. The baby room was done and I decided to take them up there, Erika struggled getting up the stairs but I helped her and I covered her eyes. Rik: Jake... you\\'re squishing my nose! J- oh, sorry... anyway, you\\'ve been wanting to know what I\\'ve been up to and here\\'s the finished product! I showed Erika the room and she had tears in her eyes, I smiled as did Tessa and Sunny. I then dropped on to one knee, took the box out and got Tessa and Sunny to change and get Erika to turn around. When she did she was shocked and started crying, I then said the infamous words... J- Erika Costell, will you marry me? Rik: YES, A MILLION TIMES YES! *crying* I put the ring on her finger, stood up and kissed her. Sunny had been filming it and so then we could show the others later, I held Erika in my chest as she cried. Rik: I CANT BELIEVE IT! *crying even more* J- you have no idea what I went through to get this *laughs and wipes tears away* She pulled away and was just in so much shock that she didn\\'t believe that this was real! Sunny ended the video and started crying along with Tessa, we both smiled and went downstairs. Sunny connected her phone to the TV and let us watch the proposal, it made me laugh as I had struggled getting the box out of my pocket. I then messaged in the group chat and everyone thought that someone was in the hospital or something: In Chat (on instagram): @jakepaul: GUYS @imanthonytruj: what\\'s happened? And we will be there as soon as possible! @erikacostell: nothings wrong but we just want you guys to come over! @tessabrooks: Tony, please come over! xxx @imanthonytruj: okay xxx @mackenziealtig: we will be over in an hour okay? @jakepaul: that\\'s fine! See you guys soon! @troybolton: where are we meeting? @erikacostell: I\\'ll get Gabriella to send you my address and then send it to the others! @troybolton: ahhh okay! End of chat. I was all smiles and it made me feel so happy knowing that I was going to marry my best friend! We posted on instagram a picture of us with this caption: \\'Mr and Mrs Youtube might happen️\\' the squad saw it and didn\\'t exactly click what we meant and Sunny and Tessa didn\\'t comment but they liked it. Soon enough the picture got 1,294,375 likes and over 1.5 million comments. Like Mackenzie said they arrived an hour later and we all sat down in the lounge, relaxing. G: what\\'s that on your ring finger, Erika? Rik: well... long story short, me and Jake are engaged... X except Tessa, Sunny Jerika: AWWWWWWWW! Chanthony: *fake cries* our boy\\'s all grown up! *wipes fake tears from eyes* J- well... who wants to watch how I did it? X- YES! J- Erika, Sunny and Tessa, you\\'ve already seen it and in person *laughs* Tesrika (literally just thought of that on the spot): ITS MEMORIES! J- play it then *laughs* We all watched it and the girls (including Tesrika, (a/n: sorry, love that name) ) started crying, the guys all cheered and looked at me. Jerika: so we\\'ve came to the conclusion that: Rik: the girls, including Ayla and Chloe, will plan my bachelorette party whilst... J- the guys, including Logan, Jitt and Quan, will plan the bachelor party! And guys there will be NO strippers alright! Chanthony: dang it! Rik: at least you cleared that up, Jake... J- they are still gonna bring strippers, so be prepared if you see them Chanthony is to blame... Rik: I was gonna blame them anyway... Ch- I feel the love! *laughs (sarcastic voice)* A- me too! *whispers to Chance* We\\'re still bringing the strippers anyway right? Ch- duhh *whispers back* J- I\\'m already re-thinking my decision about you two planning it... Chanthony: DONT! T- well this is gonna be interesting *laughs* S: I CANT WAIT! *squeals* Rik: neither can I! A- for starters if think they both should be in Ohio and around the time the baby should be due so then your baby could be born in Ohio! Jerika: okay, that\\'s fair! Ch- that\\'s all we\\'re telling you guys! J- Rik, if there is strippers at the party I\\'m so sorry... Rik: it\\'s fine, Chanthony are the culprits! Chanthony: the love is real *laughs (sarcastic voice)* J- my family in Ohio don\\'t know that I\\'m gonna be a dad or that I\\'m getting married so this\\'ll be interesting! Ch- let\\'s go down to Ohio earlier to A) set everything up and B) to explain to our parents everything! Jerika: okay! Rik: would we stay at our old houses then? J- if so that means I\\'ll have to deal with David! *growls* Ch- you would stay with me Jake! It can alternate between me and Tony if you want, we don\\'t want you to be stressed cause of David! J- thanks! I need to FaceTime Logan, wanna be here when I do it? X- yes! In FaceTime: Logan: what\\'s up brother Jakey try to roast me? Jake: moving on, Ive got some news! Logan: what? Jake: me and Erika are engaged! Logan: awwwwww, congrats. Baby Bro\\'s gone in! *laughs* Erika: really? *rolls eyes* Pauls: Really? *mocks erika* Jake: and then Erika is also pregnant... Logan: he really did go in then didn\\'t he??? *smirks* X- you are very dirty minded! *guys laugh* Gabriella: oh my god *laughs* Jake: when will we see you in person? Logan: in an hour, I\\'m flying down. Jake: okay, see ya! Logan: See ya, jaker! End of call... We all relaxed and then started talking about the wedding some more, we hadn\\'t decided where to have it but then Erika suggested somewhere actually fairly decent. Rik: well, me and Jake are obsessed with Mamma Mia so maybe the wedding could be in Greece? J- that\\'s a good idea! Rik: you seem surprised that I came up with a good idea... J- nahhhh, just shocked that I agreed! *laughs* Rik: this will be fun *laughs* Sorry for such a short chapter, I\\'ve been really busy and haven\\'t had much time to edit. I haven\\'t had decent WiFi either so that plays a massive factor in this, I can still edit but I can\\'t publish chapters out so bare with me until Saturday as I will be back in the UK and able to post more frequently. I\\'m planning on setting up a couple so on Saturday I can post a couple so I can make up for what I\\'ve missed️ thanks so much for enjoying my work and if you want me to make sequels feel free to comment and ask if you do. I\\'m going to do a \"fans choose what happens next\", for the next 48 hours you can control A) if I have a sequel, B) the gender of the baby and C) if it\\'s a miscarriage or not, I\\'ll leave that up to you guys and I am going to start incorporating Mamma Mia 2 songs so there could be spoilers and then I will add more High School Musical songs as well! Anyway that\\'s the end and like I promised I\\'ll be writing my ass off getting more chapters ready for Saturday! — Ellie Skittlez️'][Chapter 21] [\"(This chapter is the gender reveal so it won't be about the actual story I'm just making a chapter about it) Erika's PoV: TODAY! JUNE 19th 2016, THE GENDER REVEAL DAY! I am screaming with excitement if you can't tell, Jake had passed out on the couch so I decided to wake him up. Tessa and Sunny had flown back to Ohio for family time and so we'd FaceTime them later when we could, I grabbed some water balloons (pink and blue) so I could wake him up. For some strange reason I was feeling very mischievous and I liked it! I grabbed a pink water balloon and threw it on the floor to startle Jake and then did rapid fire at him until he dove off the couch and slapped the floor. I had to admit, it sounded painful and when I saw him he looked like he was in pain. I didn't help him as I was too busy laughing and then he got up and looked annoyed which fuelled my laughter up more! J- people wonder why I don't sleep, this is one of the many, many reasons! Rik: sorry, IT'S THE GENDER REVEAL TODAY! *squeals* J- could you be any louder? I'm fairly sure China just called saying that they could hear you! Rik: well if you say so... *screams in Jakes face* IT'S THE GENDER REVEAL TODAY! *squeals even louder* J- I'm right here, no need to shout! Anyway I'm fairly sure I've lost my hearing, my head is also pounding as if I've just came off a hangover which I've had before so that's how I know! Rik: that's because you have! You have a hangover and I don't understand why you were drinking in the first place! And as long as you live with me, Tessa and Sunny we are stopping you from drinking... PERMANENTLY! J- okay... Rik: who were you drinking with? J- Chanthony and the guys... Rik: even Troy and his lot? J- yep... Rik: let me go ask him... In text (instagram): @erikacostell: were you, Chad D, Zeke, Jason and Ryan out drinking with Jake, Chance, Anthony, Chad T, Emilio and Ivan Martinez and Kade? @troybolton: A) I know who they are so you didn't have to list them off and B) so what if we were? @erikacostell: does Gabriella, Taylor, Kelsi, Sharpay and Martha know? @troybolton: don't tell them please! @erikacostell: have any of you got hangovers? @troybolton: nope @erikacostell: looks like Jakes the only one @troybolton: sorry, we didn't realise that he was drunk! @erikacostell: was Nathan there? @troybolton: yep but he only had water. @erikacostell: okay, Logan's coming over today cause he wants to go with us to find out the gender so this'll be interesting... @troybolton: why? @erikacostell: Jake used to have to pick Logan up when he was drunk. @troybolton: warn him in advance! @erikacostell: okay, bye! @troybolton: bye! End of chat In call: Logan: what's up Erika? Erika: I came to warn you that Jakes got a hangover... Logan: he never drinks... why would he start now? Erika: that's what I wanna know! Logan: I'll be over in 5, sorry that you have to deal with this... Erika: it's fine, it just got me worried! Logan: I am as well at this point! Erika: I've got to go... bye! Logan: bye! End of call. I sighed and looked for Jake but saw that he was asleep, I kissed his forehead and realised that he had a fever... great... Logan arrived and saw me sitting next to Jake, and I was playing with his hair as he slept. L- how bad is it?... Rik: he's got a fever! He's thrown up twice and I don't think he should go but I want him to and I know he wants to as well! L- wake him up for me... Rik: okay... I shook Jake awake and he looked like he was in pain, I smiled sympathetically at him before Logan started talking to me and him again. L- how do you know if he was drinking or not? *shrugs* Rik: his breath smelt like alcohol... L- Jake knows better then to get drunk before something important... there's no way he's got a hangover! J- I-I'm gonna be... *gags* L- brother Jakey is alive! How are you feeling? J- l-like shit... *whispered* L- did you get drunk last night? J- no... *mumbled* L- did you drink last night? J- yes... *whispered* L- see... he didn't get drunk and I don't think he has a hangover! I think he's generally sick... Rik: how many drinks did you have last night? J- 2... and the rest was water with Nathan... L- who was there Jake?... J- me... n-nathan, kad-de, ch-chance, tony... Rik: and Troy, Jason, Zeke, Chad, Chad T, Ivan, Emilio and Ryan... L- ah okay... Rik: we have to leave soon... L- I wanna come and if I do then I can keep an eye on Jake! Rik: okay... are you sure?... L- I used to look after him when he was younger so I know what to do! J- I-I think I'm about to... Jake sprinted into the bathroom and threw up, me and Logan trailed behind and rubbed his back. Jake slid down the wall next to the toilet and shut his eyes, Logan crouched down next to him and then picked him up (bridal style) and took him to the lounge. Logan looked at me wearily as Jake fell asleep, we connected eye contact before turning our attention back to Jake. Rik: still wanna look after him?... L- a hundred percent! Rik: I'm gonna text in the group chat! L- which one? Rik: I'll add you! In Chat (instagram): erikacostell added loganpaul... @gabriellamontez: I'm super excited! @erikacostell: me too! @loganpaul: I'm here motherfuckers! @imchancesutton: what? @imanthonytruj: good to hear from you logan! @loganpaul: you too Chance and Tony! @erikacostell: I'm just gonna say this before we leave, Jake is sick! @tessabrooks: seriously? @nickcrompton: maybe because he was out drinking last night with Chanthony! @taylormckessie: around what time? @nickcrompton: 8:30 pm @sharpayevans: Ryan... were you there too? @ryanevans: of course not! @erikacostell: none of the other guys were there, it was just Jake. Maybe they met up there to play some football or basketball or soccer so don't assume that they were too! @kadespieser: anyway, why would he drink in the first place? @loganpaul: idk... I really don't know... @erikacostell: same! We've gotta go so see ya! @loganpaul: bye! End of chat Jake got up very slowly and went upstairs, Logan looked skeptical and he should have been as Jake couldn't walk up the stairs. He ran to Jakes side and helped him up the stairs before coming back down and relaxing with me. Rik: sorry about this, Logan... *sighs* L- it's okay, it's not your fault! Rik: we need to leave once Jake comes back down... L- alright! time skip at the ultrasound thing* Me, Logan and Jake walked into the midwives place thing and got signed in, our midwife, Emily, came over and greeted us! Em: Hey, Jerika! Jerika: Hey, Emily! L- I'm Logan *stretches out hand* Em: I'm Emily, nice to meet you Logan! *shakes his hand* L- nice to meet you too, Emily! Em: well if you'd like to follow me to the room, we will find out the gender! Rik: lets gooooooo! J- calm down, Rik! *whispered* Em: someone not feeling well today? J- nope... L- I came to take care of him and like that but I'm also here cause I wanna be able to see the baby in this stage before I go back to college! Em: ahh okay! *smiles* She pulled up the ultrasound on the big TVs and apparently she could already tell what gender it was. Em: I already know what gender it is! J- can we take guesses? Em: go ahead! *puts the mouse over the gender area* right there is the gender area! Rik: is it a girl? Em: it's a girl! Rik: OH MY GOD! L- congrats bro! J- I can't believe it! Jake came over and kissed me, I kissed back and we both had tears in our eyes! We couldn't believe that we were having a baby girl! J- I'm gonna go call Mom! L- call her in here! I wanna say hey! Rik: yeah, please do! J- okay, Emily, is that alright? Em: sure, I'll be outside so come and get me when you are done! On call: Pam: hey Jakers!! Jake: hey mom! Logan: hey mom! Erika: hey Pam! Pam: LOGAN?! Logan: yes it's the one and only! *laughs* Jerika: we wanna tell you what we are having! Pam: ohhh my goddd... Jake: I'll let Erika tell you! Pam: okay! Erika: first off, what do you think we are having? Pam: a boy! Erika: okay... it... is... a... girl... Pam: A GIRL!!! AWWWWW!!! Jerika: we've already got a name! Jake: we always had a gender neutral name in mind because if it was a boy then it would still work! Pam: what is it? Jerika: Alexis! Erika: Alexis Paul-Costell! Jake: it can be just Costell if you want so it's Alexis Costell! Erika: how about Paul though? I mean one day we could end up married so you don't know... and anyway I'd prefer it if the baby shared it's last name with her father! *smiles* Logan: #FAMILYGOALSBITCHEZ Jake: SHUT IT LOGAN ALEXANDER PAUL! Logan: how about you have Costell as her middle name? Jerika: good idea! Pam: I've got to go but I'll see you guys later okay? All: okay, bye Pam! Pam: BYEEEEE! End of call Jakes PoV: As we hung up I realised that I haven't done anything to myself in awhile, I also remembered that I needed to write this in my journal because it's a part of my life. Y'all might think that it's really random to mention it but that journal had became an alternative instead of hurting myself, it's got everything about me inside it. This journal goes as far back as to the first grade! Logan doesn't know about it, My parents don't know about it, Erika doesn't know about it, the only other person who does was somehow Dani. I don't understand how she fount out or that she wanted to know but she does! Every single beating/ abuse I ever got was written down in there, Alissa's hate, Logan's hate even my own damn parents hate was in there! I was brought out of my thoughts by Logan clicking his fingers I'm front of my face, he asked if I was alright and for the first time in my life I was, I was happy, living life to its potential, I was me and I was staying! We left the midwife place and Logan started talking to me. L- I think I might drop out of college after the baby is born... J- what?... why?... L- I wanna make up for everything I've ever done to you, plus I wanna be involved in Alexis' life! *smiles* J- good to have you back... Logie... *smiles* L- good to be back, Jakey! Okay, let me list off everything: •I was school shopping •Jet Lagged •CBA to post for a bit •Busy Sorry for being AFK for so long, I was busy and like I said I CBA to post for that time. So happy that Jake won his fight, kinda lowkey salty that Logan didn't win but oh well. Anyway, I've been deciding that the next couple chapters will be: A) The Bachelorette/ Bachelor parties B) The Birth of the baby C) Jake and Logan leaving Albuquerque D) maybe just maybe they crash their friends prom... E) The wedding F) I could potentially add a sequel... Thank you for being patient and all that, I am sad to say that now that schools starting (tomorrow) that means I'll be less active but every Monday I'll post! Keep that in mind okay, it means the chapters can get longer and it would be like a special occasion if I posted them early (might end up doing that anyway️) — Ellie Skittlez️️\"][Chapter 22] [\"(A/N: this chapter will not include Jake, it's the POV of the guys planning Jakes Bachelor Party ~Enjoy!) Chances PoV: Jake and Erika had called us saying that we could start planning the parties now, the only reason they did that was because they were setting up the date of their wedding and didn't want them to clash. The official date for the wedding is: Monday, 29th September 2015 (A/N: Ik I've already used September but I've decided that it's then so Jake can have the fight before the wedding and then the baby will be born a couple weeks afterwards️) Me and the guys (Tony, Troy, Chad T, Chad D, Kade, Jason, Nathan, Logan, Jitt n' Quan, Emilio, Ivan, Ryan and Zeke) were all sitting in my house planning the party and were writing it down. I started writing the names when Nick arrived and soon grabbed the pad and a different pen away before writing/ filling in the guest list; I had just finished writing George's name before Nick continued. Tony then took the pad and did 2 more names before the list ended. N- okay, this is everyone on the guest list: •Jitt •Quan •Tony •Chance •Logan •George •Mark •Kade •Nathan •Me •Chad D •Chad T •Emilio •Ivan •Troy •Jason •Zeke •Ryan •Dobre Twins •Dolan Twins •And Curtis! T- alright, now we still need: Food, Outfits and a place! Chanthony: THE PLACE NEAR CROCKER PARK (A/N: this is a mall in Cleveland, Ohio and I read Jake Paul's book and it said that him and the squad would go there so...) Ka- the abandoned park? Or the abandoned mall? Ch- mall! T- how long has it been abandoned for? X except Albuquerque group and Jitt n' Quan- Centuries! Na- we always used to go there! It was so fun! Chad- Remember when we played the ouija board in there? C- does it look trashed? Ch- no! T- that doesn't make sense! A- it was our favourite spot to go, even as like 6 year olds we'd still go and ever since we were all around 6 we found this really nice spot and we've been fixing it up since! Ch- when we started Sophomore year we decided to spend our summer cleaning it up! In that time we managed to clean it entirely, somehow we got the escalators to work and they work perfectly. The lights work and my cousin told me that her and all her friends go there to clean it up and to check on it! C- so it's like a part of your lives? I nodded and we started talking about the food, suddenly our phones blow up. We check what it is and it's the girls, excluding Erika, making a group chat with us, excluding Jake, we were all super confused so we decided to text them. In Chat- instagram: @chadtepper: what's up with this chat? And why is it excluding Jerika? @tessabrooks: because it's a group chat for their bachelor and bachelorette parties! @troybolton: okay? @sunnymalouf: we came up with some ideas but there not what Erika would do @imchancesutton: same with us, Jake wouldn't do the things we've mentioned other then where we'd have it. @loganpaul: y'all wanna know where? @mackenizealtig: yes please! @kadespeiser: it's at the abandoned mall near Crocker Park! @gabriellamontez: what's that? @taylormckessie: I heard it was an old mall that was haunted! Why would you have it there? @imanthonytruj: well, we've all been going there since we were 6 and plus start of sophomore year we spent our summer fixing it up. The escalators work, same with the elevators and lights! @tessabrooks: is it still haunted? @nathanspeiser: I don't think so... @troybolton: I've got an idea! @chaddanforth: what is it, Hoops? @troybolton: well, we're all stuck on ideas. It's being held in an abandoned mall and so maybe we should conjoin the parties! They are gonna miss prom so let's have it as like a prom going through all of the memories and maybe us guys can go off somewhere to play the ouija board whilst you girls do what you want! @nickcrompton: Jake loves the Ouija Board! @tessabrooks: he also loves that mall! It's where we all became friends and where Jake and Erika first met! @jasoncross: I don't wanna know why they met in an abandoned mall! @alexdelena: Chance, you wanna explain? xx @imchancesutton: sure! xx @zekebaylor: I wanna know! @imchancesutton: basically we weren't friends with Tessa and all that lot, it was us Golden Boys. Little did we know that Tessa and Tony had started talking to each other and decided to meet at the mall near Crocker Park, to make things seem less like a little date they decided to invite us and bamn! Erika was there and tbh it was the first time we'd seen Jake smile in awhile when him and Erika were talking! @loganpaul: wow... maybe if I wasn't self-absorbed in Ohio then maybe I would have known about this... @ivanmartinez: it not fault! @loganpaul: thanks, I guess. Ivan! End of chat Logan's PoV: I sighed as I stopped texting in the chat, Jake was so easy to read when he was upset but I never noticed! I didn't notice the little things, I didn't notice the sudden slouch in his walk, I didn't notice his bloodshot eyes and I didn't notice the happiness disappearing!\"][Chapter 23] ['Tessa\\'s Pov: The girls, and I, just got the all clear to start planning the bachelorette party for Erika! Me, Mackenzie and Sunny had started writhing things down whilst Gabriella and the others listed things off. We made the guest list and Mackenzie read it out loud. Ma: okay, this is the guest list: •Tessa •Me •Gabriella •Taylor •Sunny •Sharpay •Alex •Kelsi •Martha •Dani •Morgan •Chloe •Amanda •Lele •Angel •Her grandma •Lauren •and Kelly Te: okay, for outfits though I think we should have dresses or casual clothes and maybe bathing suits. Depends on where we have it! Su: remember the abandoned mall we use to go to when we were all stressed, in fact that\\'s where Erika and Jake first met! Ma: omg! Yes! Jake was literally about to go kill Logan I think... Te: no, that\\'s where we found the guys talking to Jake after he saw Alissa and Logan together and then he broke up with Alissa! Al: that\\'s when we all fount out the situation between them, we heard about the relationship they had and no wonder why Jake tried breaking up with her before but it was literally like 2 years ago he finally broke up with her and they\\'d been dating since the 5th grade! Te: Erika was the only other girl he let talk to him, me and Sunny broke the barrier between him and girls whereas Erika broke the walls you could say that he built up from relationships! G: that was deep guys, and I can\\'t believe that Alissa was such a bitch to him! Ta: he doesn\\'t deserve a toxic person like Alissa in his life! K: the first day of East High, he stood up for me and he\\'s such a nice guy! Alissa you could say broke him then you guys put him back together! Te: Jake was my first friend at WestLake, everyone else judged me except him and the football team. Alissa hated our entire groups guts except Jakes of course, she bullied Erika and I until Jake started talking back to her more then he should have and she didn\\'t tolerate that. We watched the abuse he got first hand, she\\'d slap and scratch him right in our faces and that\\'s why he didn\\'t stick up for us often... Ma: Erika was the only girl he would talk to if it mentioned Alissa... Erika talked to him through so much that I guess she stopped him from committing... *sighs* the amount of times Jake tried breaking up with Alissa... he tried over 12,000 times and she wouldn\\'t take it until she thought that Jake was cheating on her with Tessa... *wipes eyes* therefore she cheated on him with his own blood... *whispered* with Logan... Te: Jake, he comforted me not only because I was going out with Tony it was because my dad had been sent to jail and Anthony was on the basketball team and was at practise so once Jake saw me crying he came up to me and held me as he hates seeing anyone of us crying! Al: when we first started talking to Jake, he had this barrier built up but when Erika spoke to him she could see straight through it and I guess that helped him. Erika had a rough past as she used to be bullied at her old school and then she came to WestLake and it didn\\'t get worse but it stayed the same until the 9th grade... *sighs*... Mar: what happened in the 9th grade? X except Albuquerque girls: The golden boys... Al: we all became the baddest kids in school and no one bullied anyone cause if they did then we\\'d pin them against lockers and shout at them. Well mostly Jake at all the bullies he had which meant he pinned almost the entire school against lockers but not the teachers! G: what do you mean? Te: even our teachers gave him abuse! Whether it was verbal or not I could see it in his eyes that he hated it! Ta: what were they saying? Al: they were saying in class that he wouldn\\'t amount to be shit and like dragging him down whilst everyone else had to pay attention... two of the worst teachers he got it from was our french teacher and Mrs Clark... Ma: the last lesson he had with our French teacher went quick and when we left before he walked away from the classroom he said \"Au re-fucking-voir\" we all laughed at his use of French and walked away! Mar: poor guy, he\\'s been through hell and back but still keeps going. It\\'s safe to say he\\'s a warrior... X except Albuquerque girls: Hes Erika\\'s warrior... Mackenzie then made this chat and added all the guys except Jerika! In Chat: @chadtepper: what\\'s up with this chat and why is it excluding Jerika? @tessabrooks: because it\\'s for their bachelor bachelorette parties. @troybolton: okay? @sunnymalouf: we came up with some ideas but they aren\\'t what Erika would do @imchancesutton: same with us, Jake wouldn\\'t do the things we\\'ve mentioned other then where we\\'d have it. @loganpaul: y\\'all wanna know where? @mackenziealtig: yes please! @kadespeiser: it\\'s at the abandoned mall near Crocker Park! @gabriellamontez: what\\'s that? @taylormckessie: I heard it was an old mall that was haunted!

Ivan.'][Chapter 24] ['Logan\\'s PoV: Today was a big day! Today was the first press conference for the \"KSI VS Logan Paul\" fight and the \"Deji VS Jake Paul\" fight! I woke up at around 8:00 am and went on a run, by the time I arrived back Jake, Erika and the rest of Team Paul (A/N: includes everyone from the actual team from the real fight) was here and Jake was dressed in a black and gold suit with black ray bans. I then got changed into a full blue suit and a blue vest coat with my Rolex and blue sunglasses. Mine and Jakes Outfits: Chloe turned up and hugged me, did I forget to mention she forgave me and we started dating again? Anyway our coach came and started hyping us up, we arrived at the conference with Team Paul and got ready. TMZ had already bombarded Jake with questions relating to his and Erika\\'s current relationship and with the baby bump showing it really was a struggle for the internet not to try and leak Erika\\'s pregnancy. It\\'s a fact I know that the internet is stressing Jake out cause he\\'s getting like 20,000 DM\\'s per hour asking if Erika\\'s pregnant or not and then he destroyed his phone... I laughed and thought I\\'ll buy him a new phone after this! Once we arrived at the arena Deji started calling Jake a p!ssy and it was getting to him, I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to punch Deji. I refrained him from doing so and he calmed down, KSI started getting involved and started shouting \"F%CK THE PAULS!\" Jake stared me in the eyes for a split second before pulling his arm away from my reach and going over to Erika. I knew that he wanted to kill them and I wanted to kill them too but it really wasn\\'t worth going to jail for, Erika hugged him and he smiled, hugged back and crouched down to Erika\\'s belly and started whispering things to the baby. I smiled and walked over to Jake before talking to the baby as well, Jake kissed her belly then Erika\\'s lips before having to go on stage. Chloe walked over to me and pecked my lips before walking with Erika to a part where she could see Jake, I walked with them until my friend, Mike, pulled me aside and started talking to me. (Mi= Mike) Mi- yo... Deji is gonna mention Erika so I want you to keep an eye on her until you have to go on stage! L- what do you mean he\\'s gonna mention her?... Mi- I heard him say to JJ that after awhile JJ should walk on and start talking about Erika and then he\\'ll do the same! Keep an eye on her and Team Paul is keeping an eye on Jake... L- will do! The Conference was going pretty smooth for Jake up until they started talking about Erika... JJ- Jake... you should introduce me to your girlfriend! crowd goes ooooooooo\" JJ- for all we know you could have Logan\\'s 85% so let me give her the extra 15! crowd starts chanting she\\'s a hoe* Deji- why do you even stick up for her? There really is no point! She\\'s such a b*tch, maybe even more so then you and that\\'s hard to beat! J- SAY THAT AGAIN! I FUVCKING DARE YOU! *tenses* Deji- I guess you didn\\'t hear me the first time but... She is a B!TCH! Jake tried to charge at them but was held back by Mike, he turned around and smiled whilst me and Chloe were talking to Erika. She seemed unexpectedly calm but at least someone is, Jake ended up having to walk off stage for a moment before coming back on with me to resume the conference. Before we went on Jake and I started talking about what happened. L- dude, you good after that? J- I am now, they just p¡ssed me off saying that! L- okay... please try and not attack them... I want you mentally stable before we go on stage alright?! J- alright... *nods* Jakes PoV: As I re enter the stage I saw Deji and JJ both smirk and then the taunts started happening again... this time they crossed the fuvcking line! Logan tried taking JJ\\'s bandana off of his head but it stayed in the same position; his arm was fully extended and when Logan let go JJ charged at him like an angry squirrel He was about to swing at Logan but I walked in front and ended up getting punched right in the face and I then punched JJ back, before long it was a full on fight and we all got backed away! Vandel tried to slap me all because I told him to protect his b¡tch. His swing was worse then JJ\\'s and that hit whereas his slap didn\\'t even get near me! Anthony stood between me and Deji and then Team Paul had grabbed onto my shoulders and tried backing me away with terrible results, he then said something into the mic which made me feel like s*it... Deji- YOU AND YOUR DAD SHOULD BE TOGETHER! HE SHOULDNT BE UP THERE ALONE AND THE WORLD WOULD BE THANKFUL IF YOU JOINED HIM! My coach squirmed his way through the crowd in enough time to hold me back from slapping Deji, I completely forgot that this was live so everyone has just heard about my dad and that\\'s what ticked me off. They motioned me off of the stage and we didn\\'t continue the press conference after that. Tony sat me down and was cleaning up my face, I had a massive bruise underneath my right eye and my cheek was bleeding freely. JJ had the same exact thing as me but with a lot more blood, suddenly my phone started blowing up. I checked it and it was the Team 10 iMessage group chat, tbh I was confused as to why we were chatting in there but that\\'s when I remembered that our WiFi was getting changed over. I didn\\'t respond but I did read the messages till Logan took my phone and typed in the chat for me. In Chat: Jake Paul️: hi, it\\'s Logan. Jake is fine and will be he\\'s just p!issed about what they said. Erika Costell: Jake and KSI did fight but it was for a rational reason which they agree with and anyway it wasn\\'t even his fault! Jake Paul️: it\\'s mine, he was looking out for me and ended up getting hurt — Logan End of Chat... Erika came over and sat next to me, she leaned her head on my shoulder and once I was cleaned up I leaned my head on hers. She took my hand and laced our fingers together before sighing, she then started talking to me about what they were mentioning. Our coach walked over and started saying somethings I didn\\'t hear as I zoned out, I was brought back to reality by Logan rubbing my shoulder. L- you good? J- I-I guess... *whispers* Rik: you sure? J- no... *whispers and shakes head* Coach- they knew about what happened with your dad... they did their research to hurt you... they did that on purpose although we specifically told Vandel to not let them mention it as it\\'s a sensitive subject... J- I wanna fuvcking kill them... I\\'m literally about to lose control and kill them... *growls* L- please don\\'t, I hate them as well but remember who\\'s coming to \"beat your ass\" today? J- oh... this anger is getting used on him... *tenses* Rik: you will not touch him! J- after everything he\\'s ever done you\\'re about to shut down the opportunity to get even with him?! *shouts and stands up* A- Jake... take a minute and breathe, you need to relax! J- I CAN\\'T FUVCKING RELAX TONY! THEY CAN\\'T GET AWAY WITH THAT! ITS BAD ENOUGH THEY HAD TO MENTION THIS SH*T BUT NOW I CAN\\'T GET NEELS BACK AND I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA GIVE HIM AN OHIO BEAT DOWN?!!!!! Coach- Jake, take a minute to be human... breathe and calm yourself down... you\\'re already stressed and this isn\\'t helping... J- I-I\\'m gonna go get some air... *sighs and walks away* Mi- I\\'ll go with him... *follows Jake* Logan\\'s PoV: L- what do you mean that he\\'s already stressed? Rik: he\\'s stressed with the world wanting to know if I\\'m pregnant or not but then he\\'s been staying up til 5:30 doing emails, answering calls and editing vlogs. Tomorrow he\\'s got business meetings from 3:30 am til midnight night! And he\\'s still gotta edit, do emails and take calls all in that time! Coach- he hasn\\'t been eating the amount that he should, he\\'s been so caught up with all of this work that he hasn\\'t eaten in days. He doesn\\'t sleep because we train at 6am til 9 am and then he goes to the gym twice a day and is sorting out the house for Team 10 and you, looking at it and making sure it\\'s perfect for you! I was speechless, Jake is putting his well-being aside to focus on the Team and me... I felt like the worlds sh*ttiest brother in the world. Like when the fighting was happening back in High School, I didn\\'t notice the anger in his voice when he was on the phone to Kevin, I didn\\'t notice his lack of energy... I still can\\'t notice it until I get good looks at him, everyone else can just tell that somethings wrong with Jake whereas I couldn\\'t even see if he\\'d grown or not... Rik: he\\'s started going to the Gym 3 times a day... he goes at Lunch, the morning and then at night... we all offer to go get McDonalds for us and he turns it down, he says that he isn\\'t hungry and that he ate earlier when realistically I was with him all that day and he didn\\'t eat at all... *sighs* Chloe: he\\'ll be okay... maybe this is him getting over his dad\\'s death... i know it took Logan awhile before he started getting over it... maybe that\\'s what\\'s going on?... *shrugs* Rik: maybe... *sighs* I-I just hope that something worse won\\'t come out of it... *wipes eyes* L- I-I am literally speechless... I\\'m the worlds sh!ttiest brother... ever... this is like in High School, I couldn\\'t notice the little things and right now I can\\'t even tell if he\\'s grown or not... I can\\'t believe that he\\'s been through so much and I haven\\'t noticed... I-I... T-There are no words to describe how guilty I feel... He deserves a better brother then me... he should have someone who notices the little things... I could have talked to him... he-he should have a better brother then me... *wipes eyes and sniffles* Chloe then came and hugged me, I hugged back and put my head on her shoulder... I heard someone take a photo then start laughing and I recognised that laugh anywhere... L- what do you want b*stards? Deji- where\\'s Snakey Paul? Gone to kill himself? Hopefully he has! JJ- what\\'s the matter Logey? Cat got your tongue? *mocks Chloe* L- SHUT THE F¿CK UP JJ! YOU F*CKING RUINED MINE AND JAKE\\'S FRIENDSHIP! YOU MADE ME REALISE HOW MUCH OF A SH#T BROTHER IVE BEEN! Vandal- that\\'s enough Paul... where is Jake? We need to talk to him! Coach- we aren\\'t letting you go f*cking near him... you sick people... *scoffs* Deji- the f*cking pussy! *laughs* Anyway, pass a message from me to him... Alissa can not wait for tonight and neither can Neels... And with that they left, Erika had heard everything and texted in the instgram chat as she cba to go on iMessage... In Chat: @erikacostell: ALISSA AND NEELS ARE GONNA DO SOMETHING TONIGHT TO JAKE! SPREAD THIS TO HIS MOM AND ALL OF OUR PARENTS! @tessabrooks: okay! Rik, how is Jake? @erikacostell: could be better, I\\'ll see you guys in a bit! @tessabrooks: bye Tricky Rik ️ End of Chat... I sighed as I read the message, I could see the tears forming in her eyes. Jake walked in and noticed her on the edge of crying, he came up to her and held her as she cried into the crook of his neck. J- w-what happened? *shaking* L- Jake... Alissa... J- I-It\\'s all going down tonight? L- yep... *nods* J- for f*cks sake! *pulls away and punches wall* Rik: c-calm down Jake! *cries* He turned around and then Vandal approached us again... he looked p*ssed... the anger in his face was so evident it made my spine tingle with fear. When he reached us he walked straight into Jakes face not before shooting me a very angry look which made fear roll down my back. Suddenly he grabbed Jakes arm and started applying pressure, I could see the pain in Jakes face. He tried getting Vandal to release his hold on his arm but he only tightened it, I then went and yanked his arm off of Jakes and let our Security deal with him. Jake looked shocked and was shaking so much that I pulled him into a hug and I could feel the hem of my top get soaked, I comforted Jake so he wouldn\\'t have a panic attack and Erika rubbed his back. Our security team was talking to Team KSI and Team Deji about the way their Coach treated Jake, they laughed in the authorities faces before leaving and probably doing something even more stupid! Jake had calmed down but I was still holding him as I knew he needed it, our Coach started talking to the Authorities afterwards and gave them the all clear to talk to Jake. He refused and I did as well; he obviously wouldn\\'t wanna talk about it! Erika tried convincing him but he didn\\'t even respond, tbh I stopped as well. Although it was something really small it had really affected Jake, his shaking and crying had stopped but his breathing was increased slightly. Mi- Jake... buddy... Logan will go with you... you can both talk about it together! J- ... L- you okay Jake? *whispered to Jake* He shook his head \"No\" and then our Coach then persuaded them to talk to Jake about it tomorrow, I was starting to get worried about Jake. All Vandal did was grab Jakes arm and tighten the grip but unless it happened with Dad it David or even the bullies at West Lake, Jake would of had no reason to act like this. They left and our Coach tried talking to Jake as well but he just stayed quiet. Coach- Jake... are you okay?... J- ... L- hey... shushhhhh... i-it\\'s okay! *whispered to Jake* J- I-I wanna go home... *whispered to Logan* L- let\\'s go... *whispered to Jake* Coach- Logan?... J-Jake? L- can we go home? *whispered* Coach- of course! We all left and I sat next to Jake in the limo we rented, he laid his head on my shoulder and had his eyes shut. Ge- how is he? *motions to Jake* L- he-he will be alright... he just wants to go home... Rik: why isn\\'t he talking to any of us? *sighs* L- i don\\'t know... *pauses then sighs* I really don\\'t know... Jakes PoV: As I leaned my head on Logan\\'s shoulder I started to close my eyes and before I knew it I was engulfed into this memory of when I first started cutting, I was only 7. Flashback: I had just came home from school and I hated every second of it! I had a fight with Erika for the first time because she was right about mine and Alissa\\'s situation and I didn\\'t believe her and then she wouldn\\'t talk to me for the rest of the day! I hated it! I was rummaging through my bag when suddenly something caught my attention for the first time in awhile... it was my sharpener... the blade was shimmering in the light as I positioned it adjacent to the lamp I had set up. I sat at my desk and grabbed my ruler and unscrewed the screw before the blade was set free... I gazed at the amazing, pain-free object before taking it and figuring out what I could do with it. People in my school, who were also getting bullied, were talking to me about their self harming experience and tbh it made me think about it before trying it... ️CONTENT WARNING: CUTTING️ I pulled the blade up to my right wrist and started applying pressure, allowing this substance to escape and flow freely from it. I sighed, contently and continued until I realised that I had no way around it! I then walked into my bathroom and pulled my jeans down, I stared at my reflection in the mirror first. My cheeks had because pale with vague patches of my very, very light tan. My eyes had bags underneath them and they started watering, I then started cutting under the elastic part of my boxers. The red liquid continued to trail down the inside of my leg until I decided to clean up. ️Cutting Finished️ End of Flashback I was woken up, technically, to the sound of Logan\\'s pleading voice. I then opened my eyes and let them re focus, Logan was outside the limo arguing with someone. I couldn\\'t get my head around it so I let then continue until Mike came and checked on me, he smiled at me and we got out of the Limo and walked away. Logan started calling my name so I turned around and when he came closer I hugged him, he hugged back and then we pulled away. L- you feeling better? J- yeh... I-I guess... not really... *sighs* L- just remember, we are all here for you and because we care when Neels and Alissa come tonight we are kicking Erika out until they\\'ve left... J- t-thanks... *looks down* We walked inside and Erika noticed me and hugged me. Rik: you okay? *kisses his cheek* J- I will be *smiles* Rik: there\\'s that smile I so dearly missed! *laughed and smiled* J- you\\'re a dweeb, Ms Tennessee *laughs* Rik: I\\'ve missed that nickname *blushes* J- I\\'ve missed this... *smiles* Rik: YOU ALWAYS DO THIS TO ME! *playfully hits his chest and laughs* J- what have I done now?? *laughs* Rik: you always make me blush and it annoys me!! *laughs* J- now I can\\'t help that? Can i? *laughs* Then someone we didn\\'t wanna see walked in... Ali: JAKEYYYY BABYY! *walks to Jake and kisses his cheek* J- f!ck off, Alissa... Rik: leave him alone! You know Deji deserved what Jake did and it was just a God damn slap! Ali: it wasn\\'t just *mocks Erika* \"a God damn slap\" it was a cheap shot! All I can say is that ITS GOING DOWN...'][Chapter 25] [\"(This chapter is the gender reveal so it won't be about the actual story I'm just making a chapter about it) Erika's PoV: TODAY! JUNE 19th 2016, THE GENDER REVEAL DAY! I am screaming with excitement if you can't tell, Jake had passed out on the couch so I decided to wake him up. Tessa and Sunny had flown back to Ohio for family time and so we'd FaceTime them later when we could, I grabbed some water balloons (pink and blue) so I could wake him up. For some strange reason I was feeling very mischievous and I liked it! I grabbed a pink water balloon and threw it on the floor to startle Jake and then did rapid fire at him until he dove off the couch and slapped the floor. I had to admit, it sounded painful and when I saw him he looked like he was in pain. I didn't help him as I was too busy laughing and then he got up and looked annoyed which fuelled my laughter up more! J- people wonder why I don't sleep, this is one of the many, many reasons! Rik: sorry, IT'S THE GENDER REVEAL TODAY! *squeals* J- could you be any louder? I'm fairly sure China just called saying that they could hear you! Rik: well if you say so... *screams in Jakes face* IT'S THE GENDER REVEAL TODAY! *squeals even louder* J- I'm right here, no need to shout! Anyway I'm fairly sure I've lost my hearing, my head is also pounding as if I've just came off a hangover which I've had before so that's how I know! Rik: that's because you have! You have a hangover and I don't understand why you were drinking in the first place! And as long as you live with me, Tessa and Sunny we are stopping you from drinking... PERMANENTLY! J- okay... Rik: who were you drinking with? J- Chanthony and the guys... Rik: even Troy and his lot? J- yep... Rik: let me go ask him... In text (instagram): @erikacostell: were you, Chad D, Zeke, Jason and Ryan out drinking with Jake, Chance, Anthony, Chad T, Emilio and Ivan Martinez and Kade? @troybolton: A) I know who they are so you didn't have to list them off and B) so what if we were? @erikacostell: does Gabriella, Taylor, Kelsi, Sharpay and Martha know? @troybolton: don't tell them please! @erikacostell: have any of you got hangovers? @troybolton: nope @erikacostell: looks like Jakes the only one @troybolton: sorry, we didn't realise that he was drunk! @erikacostell: was Nathan there? @troybolton: yep but he only had water. @erikacostell: okay, Logan's coming over today cause he wants to go with us to find out the gender so this'll be interesting... @troybolton: why? @erikacostell: Jake used to have to pick Logan up when he was drunk. @troybolton: warn him in advance! @erikacostell: okay, bye! @troybolton: bye! End of chat In call: Logan: what's up Erika? Erika: I came to warn you that Jakes got a hangover... Logan: he never drinks... why would he start now? Erika: that's what I wanna know! Logan: I'll be over in 5, sorry that you have to deal with this... Erika: it's fine, it just got me worried! Logan: I am as well at this point! Erika: I've got to go... bye! Logan: bye! End of call. I sighed and looked for Jake but saw that he was asleep, I kissed his forehead and realised that he had a fever... great... Logan arrived and saw me sitting next to Jake, and I was playing with his hair as he slept. L- how bad is it?... Rik: he's got a fever! He's thrown up twice and I don't think he should go but I want him to and I know he wants to as well! L- wake him up for me... Rik: okay... I shook Jake awake and he looked like he was in pain, I smiled sympathetically at him before Logan started talking to me and him again. L- how do you know if he was drinking or not? *shrugs* Rik: his breath smelt like alcohol... L- Jake knows better then to get drunk before something important... there's no way he's got a hangover! J- I-I'm gonna be... *gags* L- brother Jakey is alive! How are you feeling? J- l-like shit... *whispered* L- did you get drunk last night? J- no... *mumbled* L- did you drink last night? J- yes... *whispered* L- see... he didn't get drunk and I don't think he has a hangover! I think he's generally sick... Rik: how many drinks did you have last night? J- 2... and the rest was water with Nathan... L- who was there Jake?... J- me... n-nathan, kad-de, ch-chance, tony... Rik: and Troy, Jason, Zeke, Chad, Chad T, Ivan, Emilio and Ryan... L- ah okay... Rik: we have to leave soon... L- I wanna come and if I do then I can keep an eye on Jake! Rik: okay... are you sure?... L- I used to look after him when he was younger so I know what to do! J- I-I think I'm about to... Jake sprinted into the bathroom and threw up, me and Logan trailed behind and rubbed his back. Jake slid down the wall next to the toilet and shut his eyes, Logan crouched down next to him and then picked him up (bridal style) and took him to the lounge. Logan looked at me wearily as Jake fell asleep, we connected eye contact before turning our attention back to Jake. Rik: still wanna look after him?... L- a hundred percent! Rik: I'm gonna text in the group chat! L- which one? Rik: I'll add you! In Chat (instagram): erikacostell added loganpaul... @gabriellamontez: I'm super excited! @erikacostell: me too! @loganpaul: I'm here motherfuckers! @imchancesutton: what? @imanthonytruj: good to hear from you logan! @loganpaul: you too Chance and Tony! @erikacostell: I'm just gonna say this before we leave, Jake is sick! @tessabrooks: seriously? @nickcrompton: maybe because he was out drinking last night with Chanthony! @taylormckessie: around what time? @nickcrompton: 8:30 pm @sharpayevans: Ryan... were you there too? @ryanevans: of course not! @erikacostell: none of the other guys were there, it was just Jake. Maybe they met up there to play some football or basketball or soccer so don't assume that they were too! @kadespieser: anyway, why would he drink in the first place? @loganpaul: idk... I really don't know... @erikacostell: same! We've gotta go so see ya! @loganpaul: bye! End of chat Jake got up very slowly and went upstairs, Logan looked skeptical and he should have been as Jake couldn't walk up the stairs. He ran to Jakes side and helped him up the stairs before coming back down and relaxing with me. Rik: sorry about this, Logan... *sighs* L- it's okay, it's not your fault! Rik: we need to leave once Jake comes back down... L- alright! time skip at the ultrasound thing* Me, Logan and Jake walked into the midwives place thing and got signed in, our midwife, Emily, came over and greeted us! Em: Hey, Jerika! Jerika: Hey, Emily! L- I'm Logan *stretches out hand* Em: I'm Emily, nice to meet you Logan! *shakes his hand* L- nice to meet you too, Emily! Em: well if you'd like to follow me to the room, we will find out the gender! Rik: lets gooooooo! J- calm down, Rik! *whispered* Em: someone not feeling well today? J- nope... L- I came to take care of him and like that but I'm also here cause I wanna be able to see the baby in this stage before I go back to college! Em: ahh okay! *smiles* She pulled up the ultrasound on the big TVs and apparently she could already tell what gender it was. Em: I already know what gender it is! J- can we take guesses? Em: go ahead! *puts the mouse over the gender area* right there is the gender area! Rik: is it a girl? Em: it's a girl! Rik: OH MY GOD! L- congrats bro! J- I can't believe it! Jake came over and kissed me, I kissed back and we both had tears in our eyes! We couldn't believe that we were having a baby girl! J- I'm gonna go call Mom! L- call her in here! I wanna say hey! Rik: yeah, please do! J- okay, Emily, is that alright? Em: sure, I'll be outside so come and get me when you are done! On call: Pam: hey Jakers!! Jake: hey mom! Logan: hey mom! Erika: hey Pam! Pam: LOGAN?! Logan: yes it's the one and only! *laughs* Jerika: we wanna tell you what we are having! Pam: ohhh my goddd... Jake: I'll let Erika tell you! Pam: okay! Erika: first off, what do you think we are having? Pam: a boy! Erika: okay... it... is... a... girl... Pam: A GIRL!!! AWWWWW!!! Jerika: we've already got a name! Jake: we always had a gender neutral name in mind because if it was a boy then it would still work! Pam: what is it? Jerika: Alexis! Erika: Alexis Paul-Costell! Jake: it can be just Costell if you want so it's Alexis Costell! Erika: how about Paul though? I mean one day we could end up married so you don't know... and anyway I'd prefer it if the baby shared it's last name with her father! *smiles* Logan: #FAMILYGOALSBITCHEZ Jake: SHUT IT LOGAN ALEXANDER PAUL! Logan: how about you have Costell as her middle name? Jerika: good idea! Pam: I've got to go but I'll see you guys later okay? All: okay, bye Pam! Pam: BYEEEEE! End of call Jakes PoV: As we hung up I realised that I haven't done anything to myself in awhile, I also remembered that I needed to write this in my journal because it's a part of my life. Y'all might think that it's really random to mention it but that journal had became an alternative instead of hurting myself, it's got everything about me inside it. This journal goes as far back as to the first grade! Logan doesn't know about it, My parents don't know about it, Erika doesn't know about it, the only other person who does was somehow Dani. I don't understand how she fount out or that she wanted to know but she does! Every single beating/ abuse I ever got was written down in there, Alissa's hate, Logan's hate even my own damn parents hate was in there! I was brought out of my thoughts by Logan clicking his fingers I'm front of my face, he asked if I was alright and for the first time in my life I was, I was happy, living life to its potential, I was me and I was staying! We left the midwife place and Logan started talking to me. L- I think I might drop out of college after the baby is born... J- what?... why?... L- I wanna make up for everything I've ever done to you, plus I wanna be involved in Alexis' life! *smiles* J- good to have you back... Logie... *smiles* L- good to be back, Jakey! Okay, let me list off everything: •I was school shopping •Jet Lagged •CBA to post for a bit •Busy Sorry for being AFK for so long, I was busy and like I said I CBA to post for that time. So happy that Jake won his fight, kinda lowkey salty that Logan didn't win but oh well. Anyway, I've been deciding that the next couple chapters will be: A) The Bachelorette/ Bachelor parties B) The Birth of the baby C) Jake and Logan leaving Albuquerque D) maybe just maybe they crash their friends prom... E) The wedding F) I could potentially add a sequel... Thank you for being patient and all that, I am sad to say that now that schools starting (tomorrow) that means I'll be less active but every Monday I'll post! Keep that in mind okay, it means the chapters can get longer and it would be like a special occasion if I posted them early (might end up doing that anyway️) — Ellie Skittlez️️\"][Chapter 26] ['Anthony\\'s PoV: Me, Logan and Chloe were all outside as Jake had walked in when we heard this shouting, the next thing we saw was Alissa making her way into the house and Neels was trailing behind her. Once she was inside smoothly he backed off and waited until Alissa came and brought him inside, she locked the door and that\\'s when we new that Jake wasn\\'t gonna hold back. Our security soon came and that\\'s when we knew that they had the house to themselves, considering it was Logan\\'s house he couldn\\'t find a way to get in. We all waited outside anxiously and then Team 10 arrived with Troy and that lot, they broke down the door and we walked inside to see Neels and Jake going at each other. Erika was in the corner crying and then Alissa was laughing and then started blowing kisses to us, we then realised that she was filming it. Our team slowly approached Jake as he could still swing at any moment and kill us! Jake was shaking once we pulled them away and they both were masked with blood, Jake refused to talk to anyone and then Alissa started on Jake as well! She was slapping him and he let it happen! Me and Chance then grabbed Alissa and she was screaming and kicking in our hold, we could see it in Jake\\'s face that he was upset and we knew that he needed to calm down. Ali: JAKE! YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS! J- TOTALLY YOU SLUT! Once the word \"Slut\" escaped his mouth we all gasped, the only way you could be a \"slut\" is if you have been kissing other guys whilst you\\'re in a relationship. Then it all clicked, she\\'s had a reputation for hooking up with multiple guys at once but then her and Logan. It wasn\\'t just WITH Logan , it was based off of multiple guys who had been manipulated by her... L- jake... Look at me... J- F!CK OFF LOGAN! L- NO! A- JAKE CALM DOWN! J- I CAN\\'T GOD DAMN \"CALM DOWN\" ANTHONY! THESE TOXIC ADS PEOPLE P!SSED ME OFF! Coach- you being p!ssed won\\'t help anyone Jake... Take a breather... J- No... *turns and looks at Logan* She didnt just cheat on me with you... *wipes eyes* it was half of the god damn school... *walks outside and screams head off* Rik: Logan! *runs and cries in his chest with Chloe rubbing her back* Chloe: erika... You need to explain what happened... Rik: I-I cant... Not right now and I need to tell you guys something... T- what is it? G: we\\'re here for you... Jake and the baby... Rik: w-well... I\\'m falling ill and if I don\\'t get treatment I will die and if I do then Alexis has a chance of dying... *cries even more* Ta: have you guys made a decision?? Rik: no... But for a better chance for us both, Jake doesn\\'t know, is that I can go into Labour earlier and it gives us the chance to let Alexis live-- K- I sense a \"But\" coming... Rik: she may have some difficulties, they recommended that I go into Labour earlier which I have already agreed with... Ch- how are you gonna tell him? Rik: I\\'m gonna play it off as if I actually went into Labour whilst he\\'s out and then I\\'ll have the baby but we won\\'t be able to tell him for awhile... Te: when will you go into labour? Rik: tomorrow... This will be a short chapter as I have homework and plus the next three will be the Wedding and both bachelor and bachelorette parties and then I have some announcements sorry that this is a short story and that this is an incredibly!t short chapter but I\\'d thought that maybe I\\'d give an extract of the sequel I\\'ve had ideas for... Anyway here is the extract of a possible sequel- Tuesday, 18th April 2017 Jake\\'s PoV: I woke up around 8 am and looked to my right to see that Erika had gone again, the death of Alexis had really gotten to her as we were expecting to have a healthy birth and pregnancy but then Erika fell ill, gravely ill. W e had the option to choose between Life or Death but either way someone would be up above, we didn\\'t pick and that led to Erika giving birth earlier and well Alexis had lived for a full hour before the doctors described her condition to us, the only words that left the doctors mouth was that \"She is in Critical Condition\" that immediately broke our hearts and they timed her death as 11:42 am, Monday, 29th March 2017... The team were utterly disappointed but they weren\\'t as heartbroken as us, Logan stayed with us because he wanted to be there for us which I totally thanked him for . A couple days after her death the doctors finally gave the all clear to Erika for her to start returning to somewhat of a normal routine , I hadn\\'t addressed anything to our fans about Erika being pregnant which was good as they all would have been heart broken, the change from being parents to being normal people was tough. I mean it would for anyone... In exactly 11 days and around 41 minutes it would mark the one week anniversary of Alexis... I shook off what I was feeling and walked into the shower, my body was masked of scars, new and old, which made me more self-conscious about my body and what it looked like. I hope you liked that as this could be the start of something new! Jks well not really as it generally could! Soo over ditched the update schedule this weekend but I will not be posting tomorrow as I cba to post three days on the block but hopefully you\\'re all okay with the death of Alexis as I\\'m actually gonna incorporate that! -- Ellie Skittlez xoxo'][Chapter 27] ['This chapter will contain some strong and touchy subjects which are named below so if you don\\'t feel comfortable with this you don\\'t have to read as I want too make sure that if you are then enjoy - this chapter contains: -Violence -Self Harm -Depression -Suicide -Strong Language -Anxiety -Anorexia This is a warning, read if you want- I will not force you too! Jake\\'s Pov: I woke up and my body ached! I groaned multiple times before eventually leaving the warm and comforting feel of my bed, I checked my phone and it read 4:30 am, I had 2 hours until I needed to get ready for school. I turned my light on and stared at my reflection, I saw the one person I hated. Myself. I walked to my bathroom and locked the door, today was the day that I finally get the one person back for ruining my life and my girlfriend\\'s, Erika Costell. Neels Visser, he was the main reason I had all these mental problems other then Alissa. Neels cheated on Erika with Alissa but then again I was getting cheated on by half of the school so I didn\\'t care. As I was rummaging in my bathroom I finally fount what I had been seeking, my razor blade. I grabbed it intensely and almost immediately let the cool metal dance across the wrist of my left hand, with each cut I made the sensation of finally being selectively free washed over me and it was as if cutting was a drug and I was getting addicted. I made about 20 cuts and didn\\'t stop until my entire arm was covered, I washed my arm and blade before finally taking a shower and getting ready. By the time it was 6:30 am I had left and was at school with the boxing equipment, the anger I had stored up and shut down had just erupted slightly as I beat this punching bag as if it was Neels. I heard clapping when I was done and turned to see Logan, I didn\\'t want to see him as it would make me go back again and I don\\'t want to go back down that hole of emptiness and reaching a breaking point as I had only really reached my little for of hope that was casted upon Erika. Each word that came out of Logan\\'s mouth made me feel sick and worthless, I was there working extremely hard and actually taking chances whereas he was rubbing it in that he was better at everything then me. Logan: If you engage your core more it would help with the power building up in your swing! Jake: thanks.. *mumbled* I continued to swing and didn\\'t use any of his tips as I was probably gonna get expelled today anyway, after my last punch I don\\'t know what came over me but I started punching it harder and harder until I eventually stopped and when I did I screamed and punched the air. I could tell Logan was confused but he wouldn\\'t be for much longer and neither would I. I walked out of the gym and went straight to the changing rooms, Chance and Tony always met me there and they helped me through everything. I had to tell them that I was transferring to another school but I couldn\\'t bring myself to ruin today so I just stayed quiet as they took my gloves off and the wrap I had in my hands. Chance: Bro, it\\'s literally gonna be 99 so I don\\'t think you\\'ll live in that! *points at Jake\\'s overly big hoodie* Jake: I don\\'t care, I\\'ve got something planned that will kick me out the school anyway... *mumbled* Anthony: we saw you and Lo talking, what was that about? Jake: he was rubbing it in my face that he\\'s better then me at everything and that I need to engage my core and some dumbass shit like that! *growls* Chance: Neels is planning something today.. Jake: So am I... So am I... Anthony: Jake.. Chance: are you gonna beat his ass up? Jake: Maybe I am, Maybe I ain\\'t.. *chuckles and smirks* The bell for first lesson rang and so we all went to first lesson, me and the squad all had the same teacher so as soon as she would do the register we\\'d all walk out but today I didn\\'t wanna. Today marked a new day for me, Neels was getting what he deserved so I could care less what the teachers say! Our French Teacher had started droning on and on about the past tense whilst I fount myself daydreaming about a better life compared to this excuse of one. Teacher: Ça ne va pas durer éternellement, Monsieur Paul Jake: huh? I don\\'t know what you just said Teacher: I know you don\\'t Jake: sorry, what\\'s up? Teacher: Écoutez! Jake: Okay! Teacher: I said, Your Vines- it\\'s not going to last forever. What the? Suddenly she had my complete attention, and then some. It\\'s not going to last forever. Those words echoed in my brain. I stared straight at her, with an expression that conveyed the intense anger her ignorance had ignited in me; she stared back. We were communicating with each other better than anytime previously—not in French, not in English, not even with words. Then, in a way I don\\'t really have the ability to describe, I blinked and she disappeared from my life. Oh, she was still next to me, and in fact she was speaking to me, and even speaking about me, as she stepped back in front of the classroom, trying to make an example of me to my classmates — her way of regaining authority. I didn\\'t care. I was finished with her, and the class. I turned my head and looked out the window, and beyond— all the way to a better life, where I swear I saw a massive party going in the offices of Beats By Dre. The bell rang — and I heard that. I got up from my desk and headed for the door, speaking the last few words of French I would ever say. \"Au re-fucking-voir\" and left, I hadn\\'t seen Erika yet and that meant she might not be here to see the fight. We had Gym and we were doing football, as I was getting changed I heard Neels\\' voice and it ticked me off. He was joking with my ex- best friend, Simon. He used to be my friend until he had sex with Alissa and let\\'s just say it tore me apart, emotionally and mentally. Erika had to teach me how to love again and I\\'m still after like 3 years of mine and Erika\\'s relationship I\\'m still struggling to let go of what happened when my life truly went downhill. I sighed and continued to change until Neels started talking about Erika and then me, I had just finished changing when he said something that pissed me off way too much. Neels: Erika is so fucking anorexic and it\\'s sickening! If you don\\'t like yourself do anything else just don\\'t starve yourself! Simon: dude, as much as you hate her and Jake that crossed the line.. Jake: Neels, my girlfriend isn\\'t fucking anorexic! She eats as much as she should and thats it! You can chat however much shit about me as you want just don\\'t bring my girl into this! *tenses and shouts at Neels* Neels: WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD SORT OUT HER EATING DISORDER FIRST! AND WHILST YOU\\'RE DOING THAT THEN MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO TALK TO HER ABOUT HOW MANY GUYS SHE\\'S SLEPT WITH! SHE\\'S A FUCKGIRL AND IS USING YOU! *yells at Jake* Jake: SHE ISN\\'T A FUCKING FUCKGIRL! YOU\\'RE A FUCKBOY FOR HOOKING UP WITH ALISSA THAT SLUT! *tenses even more and shouts at Neels* Neels: I FUCKING HATE YOU! WHY DON\\'T YOU JUST LEAVE! ERIKA WOULD NO LONGER TREAT YOU AS HER LITTLE SEX TOY AND YOU\\'D BE FREE! I THINK HELL IS WAITING FOR YOU! I MEAN AFTER ALL WHERE WOULD BAD BOY JAKE PAUL END UP? WELL THAT\\'S FOR HIS PARENTS TO TALK ABOUT, OH WAIT THEY ARE TOO BUSY FIGHTING ABOUT WHERE YOU WENT WRONG IN LIFE! *shouts at Jake* Coach: BOYS! YOU ALL ARE DOING 1000 LAPS ROUND THE SCHOOL NOW GO! We all started running and then I saw Logan, he had started running as well and eventually caught up with me. I started sprinting and that\\'s when I lost it, I finished my laps and had to do cardio straight after. We had to go into the gym and do these: -Shoulder press 3 x 10 -Mountain Climbers 3 x 40 -Burpees 3 x 10 -Handstands 3 x failure -Jump rope 20 minutes x 18 -Shoulder extensions 3 x 8 - 1 hour of boxing -20 minute ab workout. Our timetable when we have gym is completely different, say your lessons are an hour long well for gym that can run into next lesson for however long it wants. I finished all of that and managed to finish with Chance and Anthony behind me as well, Coach kept us behind and let everyone else leave, we wouldn\\'t exactly be late to next lesson considering we had around 20 minutes left. Coach: What happened in that changing room? Jake: something personal.. Anthony: Fuck this! Let\\'s go! We all left and got changed as quickly as possible, we then walked out and considering everything we had to do we managed to not even break a sweat. I went straight to our science as that was Erika\\'s class and she was in there, they had finished packing away and she opened the door, the rest of the gang who were in there grabbed their things and walked out. They all could tell that I was pissed but they didn\\'t know what was going down at break.. We walked to the bleachers and all talked, I stayed quiet but started digging my nails into my skin, as soon as that fucking bell goes all hell will break loose I was thinking. I was quite deep at thought when Erika started talking to me, I was confused as to what she was saying but when I finally snapped back to reality it all made some sort of sense. Erika: Jake? *snaps fingers in his face* Jake: Huh? Erika: What\\'s going on? You\\'ve been distant from us since this morning.. *puts hand on his knee* Jake: all you need to know is as soon as that bell goes I won\\'t be holding back... Chance: don\\'t ask.. Anthony: it\\'s something that involves earlier and we aren\\'t gonna talk about it... Tessa: if it involves Jake, Erika has a right to know! I mean she is his girlfriend! Jake: y\\'all see soon! That what\\'s about to happen! And it might get me expelled... Erika: Jake.. Kade: who are you fighting, Jake? Jake: little bitch boy, Neels... *smirks* little fucking pussy boy was talking about you, Rikka. Said you are anorexic and are using me so my response to that was backing you and now I\\'m gonna beat his ass! *smiles* Anthony: tell them the other thing, Jake.. Jake: He told me to go kill myself soooooooo... Alex: Wow... Nick: how are you and Logan? Jake: dunno.. We don\\'t talk at all... n-not after.. Nathan: Let\\'s move on from this as I don\\'t wanna be the cause for people getting upset.. What do y\\'all wanna do after high school? Jake: depends... Which school will take me after this.. *sighs* maybe I don\\'t wanna be anything, *mumbled* maybe I don\\'t even wanna be here anymore... *looks down* Mackenzie: Let\\'s all meet at the abandoned mall at 4:30 okay? Everyone except Jake: okay! The bell rang and I pegged it to the gym, me and Neels were secretly talking last night and agreed that if we were gonna fight it would be in the gym. Although it seems dumb to tell someone you\\'re gonna fight them it was so we both could do it without someone pussing out, I ran so fast that the group couldn\\'t catch me and we all could usually keep up with one another. I ended up passing Logan and he was confused so he started to follow me, that\\'s when he saw Neels and tweeted that me and him were fighting in the gym, of course the entire school came to watch. The squad still hasn\\'t shown up and that meant that they wouldn\\'t see me beat this kids ass, all the teachers tried getting in the room but it didn\\'t work and soon I made the first punch. Everyone was filming it and that\\'s what threw us both off, we still managed to continue though. After the first punch he floored me but I punched him straight in the face; regaining control. I then got him to the ground and that\\'s when I let loose, I held him down and just three punch after lunch at him. By now my face was bleeding a little bit and my knuckles were screwed but when I am compared to him I didn\\'t even have a dent on me. Eventually the teachers ripped me off him and took me away, they called an ambulance for Neels and let me be. As the bell for third lesson rang I got out of the teachers grip and went to class with the blood still on me, Simon came in before me and as soon as I walked in he knew that Neels had it 100x worse. The teacher didn\\'t care about me so she ignored me until the principal came and tried getting me to leave the class. Principal: Have you got Jake Paul? Teacher: Yes, Jake you need to go with sir.. Jake: I\\'m not going anywhere. Principal: Please Jake, come on.. Jake: I just fucking told you, I ain\\'t going anywhere... Teacher: Language Jake: Japanese... The class laughed but then me and the Principal started arguing and he eventually got bored and just gave me my punishment then and there. Principal: After the incident you caused at break I have no choice but to expel you permanently! Jake: good! That means I\\'m a free human from this and that means I\\'m no longer in your control so I say FUCK THIS SCHOOL! *sticks middle finger up at Principal* Principal: you may now leave, You are now dismissed and free to go! I will call your parents and they can handle you from there! And I wish your parents did a better job with you so you can be like Logan, an exceller. Jake: for the last fucking time, stop comparing to my brother.. I\\'M NOT LIKE HIM AND NEVER FUCKING WILL! *leaves* I left the school and drive home to be greeted by my mom, she seemed pissed... My dad afterwards came out and then I knew that I was gonna get shouted at.. They brought me inside and sat me down, before long my parents were arguing again and that\\'s what got to me. Pam: JAKE JOSEPH PAUL! CARE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE PRINCIPAL CALLED? Jake: Because I beat this kids ass! *laughs* Pam: this isn\\'t funny, boy. You put him in the ICU and they had to put him on life support! Greg: Pam... Let\\'s hear the story as you always wanna hear it first before you make your decision! Pam: I am not listening to him lie to our faces, you maybe wanna waste your time on him but I\\'m not! I\\'ve got better places to be other then tending to this fucking kid get into fights and listening to the story! Jake: SHUT THE FUCK UP! BOTH OF YOU! I GET THAT I\\'M NOT LOGAN THE GOLDEN CHILD! I WILL NEVER BE LIKE HIM SO STOP ACTING AS IF YOU WANT TWO LOGANS! IF YOU WANT ME TO BE LIKE LOGAN JUST LET HIM BE AN ONLY CHILD! BUT NO YOU HAD TO GIVE BIRTH TO ME AND THAT\\'S WHAT MADE YOUR LIFE TO THROUGH THE RAILS! Alissa and everyone was right... See you around whenever, that all depends on whether you except me or not... *wipes eyes and runs upstairs* I started pacing around my room and then my anxiety kicked in and made all these voices appear, I couldn\\'t shake this feeling of doubt and that made them grow even more louder. You\\'re worthless Erika is using you Listen to Neels Take the easy way out Logan is better Logan is better Logan is better The phrase \"Logan is better\" kept on repeating over and over in my head, after awhile Logan arrived home as he was a senior and when it gets close to summer they all get half days. Tears were streaming down my face as the voices kept on getting louder and louder, the more I tried calming myself the more they came back and I couldn\\'t deal with it. I started punching the wall and then someone knocked on my door, I ignored it and continued breaking my hand. I stopped when the voices became too unbearable and I started pacing again, my breathing had increased and I knew that I was having an anxiety attack but I couldn\\'t focus on that. I started hearing another voice on top of them and so I put my hand up to my mouth and held it there, the voice from outside my door became muffled and soon I fount myself in my bathroom looking for the one thing that can take this pain away. Before I grabbed it I looked in the mirror and the voices came back even louder and they destroyed me. Look at that ugly mother fucker You should be ashamed of how you look No wonder Alissa ruined you Alissa broke you Alissa destroyed you Erika doesnt want you for you, she wants to be popular Everyone doesnt want to see you Everyone wants the king of Westlake to crumble No wonder why you have trust issues, I\\'m surprised that people trust you! I continued to cry and I locked my bathroom door, I slowly calmed and that\\'s when I started cutting. I didn\\'t realise it but I let the blade take control and that led me to a suicide attempt... I sat on my toilet seat and cut extremely deep on both my wrists and made a long cut going from my wrist to my shoulder, I did it on my left wrist to my left shoulder and ended up sliding down the wall. The banging on my bedroom door stopped and so did the voices I was hearing, but then my bathroom door started getting hit and by the time the bathroom door was opened I had lost consciousness... Logan\\'s Pov: As I was driving home from school my mom called and told me what happened to Jake and quite frankly he deserved it, but when she tried talking to him after their fight he wouldn\\'t answer and was worried his anxiety had kicked in so I rushed home and ran up the stairs to his room. My mom was standing outside with a grim expression so I let her go downstairs, I knocked on his door multiple times and even said somethings to try and calm him but I guess it didnt work because I heard his bathroom door open so I broke his door down and ran into his bathroom but that was locked so I tried as hard as I could but I was too late because when the door opened it revealed Jake laying against the wall bleeding excessively. I ran to him and tried waking him up but it didn\\'t work, I shouted for mom and she came up only to see her youngest son bleeding on the floor. Pam: GREG! CALL AN AMBULANCE AND TELL THEM TO HURRY! *cries* Greg: *on phone* they are on their way, they are trying to go as fast as possible! I held Jake and waited for the paramedics to arrive, they did and he was rushed off to the hospital as a suicide attempt. I rode with them as my parents were in there car directly behind us, they had managed to stabilize him and got him straight into surgery whilst they took us to the private waiting room they had for members of family to suicide members. The nurses were being really frantic around us as the world started spinning uncontrollably, I was on edge of crying my eyes out but didn\\'t as I had faith in the doctors and respectfully waited for the response about my brother\\'s condition. I really wanted to know why he tried to commit suicide. My thoughts were cut off to the sound of the doctors voice, we stood up and let him explain what happened. Doctor: we stopped the bleeding and he is fine, he\\'s recovering in his room as we speak. We just need you guys to answer a couple questions as to why he would do this before we let you see him. Logan: Okay, so what are the questions? Doctor: they are routine like age, full name and if he has like anxiety and everything. Greg: his full name is Jake Joseph Paul Pam: he is 17 and has anxiety and anorexia.. Doctor: has he ever tried to do this type of thing before? Logan: yes, once. Doctor: do you know why he would try to do this? Greg: me and his mother were fighting and it upset him so I\\'m guessing that he had an anxiety attack and that leads up to now.. Doctor: you may now go and see him, he is still asleep from the anaesthesia we gave him so talk to him and if he wants when he wakes up we will keep visiting hours open longer for you guys to see him. Everyone: thank you. We left the waiting room and walked to Jake\\'s room, the sight we saw was frightening. He was laying in his bed looking lifeless, the bags underneath his eyes were extremely big and he was as pale as the sheets he was under. You could see his ribcage through his gown and his breathing was going at the same speed as his heart rate, really slow. His arms had been stitched up and bandaged, I slowly made my way over to his bed kissed his forehead. My mom was crying and my dad was holding her, I sat in the chair next to him and mumbled something under his breath. \"Why would you do this, Jakey?\" Pam\\'s Pov: After I heard this massive bang from Jake\\'s room Logan shouted and that\\'s what made me incredibly nervous, as I made my way into his bathroom I saw something that made my heart stop... My son was bleeding and was surrounded in his own blood, Logan was desperately trying to wake him up but it didn\\'t work. I shouted for Greg and he came upstairs, he called an ambulance and they eventually arrived and escorted him out of the house. We followed the ambulance as they rushed Jake to the hospital and then they took us to a private waiting room, we waited in there for over an hour before we were allowed to see him. When we saw him I cried, what had he done to himself. I went to Greg and cried into him, after a while I pulled away to see Logan talking to Jake. I went to them and held Jake\\'s hand in my own, I moved his hair out of his face and kissed his forehead. Greg then pulled me into a chair next to him and we let Greg see Jake fully, we all started talking when Jake started waking up. We heard him groan and when we turned our attention to him he was trying to open his eyes, when he did he was very confused so we explained everything to him and wanted to know why he did it. Pam: Jake.. Why? Jake: I had an anxiety attack and it got the better of me.. So before this I was punching the wall but now we are here.. *whispered* Logan: Jake... I\\'m so sorry for everything I\\'ve done to you, this is all my fault.. You wouldn\\'t have anxiety if I hadn\\'t told Alissa and the school about your relationship with her, you wouldn\\'t have trust issues if I didn\\'t backstab you... *wipes eyes* Jake: Lo, it\\'s fine.. You didn\\'t realise that this would happen.. The only person to blame is me for putting you guys through all of this.. *cries slightly* Logan: don\\'t cry, Jake.. We won\\'t blame you for this as you can\\'t and couldn\\'t control it... *wipes Jake\\'s tears and wipes his own eyes* The doctor then came in and explained that he was free to go as long as he didn\\'t try and do this again, Jake agreed and we left the hospital. Jake and Logan sat in the back with Jake\\'s head on Logan\\'s shoulder, before we officially discharged Jake I asked the doctor if he knew which room Neels Visser was in and I visited him. Flashback: As the doctor led me through the vast hospital hallways we eventually arrived outside Neels Visser\\'s room, he allowed me inside and there I saw the boy who broke my son.. He was laying lifeless in his bed and I saw all the bruises and cuts that masked his body; Jake did a really good job. I went over to the side of his bed and started talking to him and explained that if Neels ever tried anything against Jake then I wouldn\\'t let my son hold back, I\\'d make sure that Jake left a mark.. Before I left I said these words to him: \"Don\\'t test these Pauls, they always fight back\" End of flashback By the time we got home Jake was asleep and Logan was as well, their heads were on top of each other and they looked really adorable. I took a photo and put it on my instagram, I tagged them both and then put as my caption: \"My sons, my life, you mess with one, don\\'t expect them to hold back\" We got them out of the car and put them on the couch, they were still cuddled up together and looked really cute. Suddenly Jake\\'s phone started going off and he woke up, he kept his head on Logan\\'s shoulder but pulled out his phone and read his message. I knew he wanted to go out so I let him, I needed to be nicer around him and to him. Jake\\'s Pov: After everything that happened I was ready to leave my house, I met everyone at the mall. Before I left I changed into another hoodie and black skinny jeans with my sliver dog tag, I arrived and Erika threw her arms over me. I chuckled and held her, she giggled and we kissed. Everyone then walked into the mall and we sat down in front of a JD Sports shop, we all started talking and then I told them what happened. Anthony: Jake, where were you? Erika: yeah we were all looking for you. Jake: like I said earlier, I\\'m expelled permanently... Chad: what happened to Neels as we didn\\'t watch the fight. Jake: Hospital... Nathan: to just get stitches, right? Jake: yes and no.. Erika: Jake... Chance: did you.. Jake: I didn\\'t kill him but I almost did... The ICU should help him make a decent recovery with the life support he\\'s got... Alex: wow... Sunny: Jake, he got you that upset? Tessa: he could die, guys.. But anyway what are you gonna do school wise now? Jake: Well, I was getting transferred to a different school so now my new school is Easy High in Alburquerque, New Mexico... Erika: a-are you serious right now??.. *cries* Tessa: Jake.. W-why didn\\'t you tell us to begin with? Jake: for this reason.. I-I don\\'t wanna leave you guys and as a back up in case I got kicked out they said they\\'d take me even if I was naughty.. But the real reason behind that was because I was sick of everything... Not you guys but of the bs, abuse and rumours about me... *cries* Nick: guess the Golden Boys is over with then? Right... Jake: No.. You guys need to stop the bullying... They listen to you and who knows maybe y\\'all will end up joining me in East High.. *chuckles* Mackenzie: When do you leave? Jake: last three days of summer.. Alex: we still have another three months of school left.. Until we\\'re sophomores! Kelly: maybe you could make a compromise where you stayed in IEU and did the work then go home.. Jake: I\\'m wondering what my mom will say to that... Sunny: what did she say about this? Jake: She was ballistic whereas my dad wanted to hear the story but my mom said in front of me \"I am not listening to him lie to our faces, you maybe wanna waste your time on him but I\\'m not! I\\'ve got better places to be other then tending to this fucking kid get into fights and listening to the story\" so yeah... Kade: the martinez twins have no idea what\\'s going on... *laughs* Ivan: creo que estan hablando de nosotros -I think they are talking about us- Emilio: Estoy de acuerdo y también quiero romper a la caliente hermana de Tony -I agree and I also wanna smash Tony\\'s hot sister- Anthony: Emilio, I\\'m not letting you smash my sister.. He laughed and everyone joined in, we all left at around 7:00 pm and went on houseparty. On the call was: -using their insta names- •ivanmartinez (with Emilio) •erikacostell •tessabrooks •nickcrompton •kadespeiser •mackenziealtig •chadtepper •sunnymalouf •kelly_xox -don\\'t know her acc Instagram - •alexdelena •loganpaul (with Jake) •nathanspeiser •imanthonytruj •imchancesutton And that\\'s it (Sara and the rest don\\'t have it), me and Logan were enjoying this time when our parents called us down for dinner. They knew I was anorexic but still tried to get me to eat, after today though I was starving for the first time. I beat Logan down the stairs and actually ate my food before waiting for Logan so we could go back and talk to everyone. We all stayed up until 1 am before falling asleep and for once I generally felt happy... This is the end of this sort of thing, ik it\\'s random but I thought y\\'all would wanna have one like this so here you go. This is really bad I haven\\'t even started writing the next chapter...

It was a quiet Monday at East High school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Gabriella Montez walked to her locker getting her books for the first couple of classes. \"Hey girl,\" Taylor said smiling walking up to her best friend. \"What\\'s up Tay?\" she asked pulling out her notebook before shutting her locker. \"Nothing just classes,\" she said with a sigh. \"Oh! And the declaration team needs you tomorrow,\" she exclaimed. \"Relax, I\\'ll be there. I couldn\\'t forget you guys,\" she told her best friend looking at her. \"I don\\'t know why I\\'m so stressed,\" Taylor complained as they walked towards their homeroom. \"You\\'re stressed about the yearbook, declaration team, school, Chad,\" Gabriella said looking at her. Taylor blushed and looked at her friend. \"You\\'re lucky. Chad is a great guy,\" Gabriella said and saw the vice principal walking towards them. \"Miss Montez can I speak to you for a moment in my office?\" she asked looking at the two teens. \"Of course,\" Gabriella nodded following the vice principal. She was lead back to the office and there she saw a boy which she hadn\\'t seen around before. He was tall, tanned and had brown short hair. When he looked up his bright blue eyes met Gabriella\\'s brown. \"Miss Montez this is Troy Bolton. He transferred from a school abroad and will go to East high this semester. I was hoping that you would want to show him around, and make him feel like a Wildcat,\" the vice principal smiled. \"Of course,\" Gabriella said shifting her gaze from the vice principal to Troy back to the vice principal. \"Now I think you should head to class and welcome to East high,\" she smiled and they walked out the door. \"You already know my name but I didn\\'t catch yours,\" he said smiling that could make anyone\\'s knees weak. \"I\\'m Gabriella,\" she said exchanging a hand. \"Troy,\" he said shaking it. \"Do you mind if I see your schedule for a moment?\" she asked and he gave her the piece of paper. \"We have almost the same classes,\" she smiled and gave it back to him. \"They also gave me this,\" he said showing her another couple of papers. \"Mandatory information such as meeting place if there is a fire drill, a map, school rules etc… The other is the book\\'s you\\'ll need and where your locker is,\" she explained. \"I have no idea where anything is,\" he confessed. \"Let\\'s start by getting your books,\" she said and they headed towards the library. Ten minutes later they both walked out of there holding a stack each. \"How many classes are there?\" Troy wondered looking down at the books he was holding. \"Not that many, but don\\'t worry there are classes where you use several books,\" she said looking at him. \"Now your locker isn\\'t so far away from class,\" she said and they rounded a corner. \"It\\'s right here,\" she said and pointed to the locker with a wildcat paw on. \"We have a high school spirit,\" she said when she saw his smile. \"I can see that,\" he laughed. Troy spun the combination and opened the locker. Gabriella helped him take the books he needed before lunch and put the rest in the locker. As Troy closed the door the warning bell sounded. \"We have to hurry. Mrs Darbus won\\'t hesitate to give detention,\" Gabriella warned. \"That\\'s not good,\" he said and they hurried to class. They just made it inside the door as the final bell was sounded. \"Ms Darbus this is Troy he is new,\" Gabriella explained to the teacher. \"Yes, yes. Welcome to East high Mr Bolton,\" the teacher said exited and Troy gave her the paper. Gabriella walked to her seat in the back of the class while Troy sat down in the only available seat on the front row. Home room dragged by and before they knew it, it was language and Troy and Gabriella both had Spanish. \"Could you help me with Spanish because that was amazing!\" Troy praised her after the double lesson was over. \"How do you do it?\" he questioned. \"Well, I\\'m Hispanic so technically English is my second language and Spanish is my first,\" she said with a smile. \"Would you still teach me?\" he asked. \"Of course,\" she said looking up at him. They stopped by their lockers and both of them got their lunch. \"I\\'ll introduce you to some of my friends. They\\'re all in our class,\" she explained and they walked into the cafeteria. \"Hi everyone. This is Troy, he is an exchange student this semester and I\\'m helping him around here,\" Gabriella explained and sat down in the empty seat beside Jason. Troy sat down between Gabriella and Chad. \"I\\'m Chad and that is my girlfriend Taylor. That is Zeke, Jason and of course you know Gabriella,\" Chad said listing all the names at the table. \"Nice to meet you all,\" Troy said and smiled. \"I\\'ve heard so much about the Wildcats but what do you play?\" Troy asked. \"Honestly Gabby. You failed,\" Chad said looking at her. Gabriella only sighed deeply. \"Of course,\" she muttered. \"The wildcats are a basketball team. We have basketball try-outs tomorrow during free period,\" Chad explained. \"Zeke, Jason and myself are all on the team,\" he said. \"That sounds fun. I have played some basketball home with my dad but I\\'m not that good,\" he warned. \"The team is in desperate need of more players so as long as you can get the ball in the net I would say you have a good chance,\" Zeke smiled and Troy shook his head. The little group sat there talking to each other and getting to know each other during lunch. When the bell rang they all headed in their own direction to find their books for the next classes. Gabriella and Taylor had their lockers beside each other so after they had found their books Troy and Gabriella walked to Troy\\'s locker. Troy needed some help from Gabriella to find the way but they made it to class just in time. At 15:45 that day when English was finished Troy and Gabriella packed up their books and the first stop was Gabriella\\'s locker. \"I really appreciated that you helped me so much today Gabriella,\" Troy said on their way to his locker. \"It\\'s no problem. It isn\\'t fun to be here alone the first couple of days,\" she said and he looked at her. \"I was new here last year and it took a couple of days before I meet Taylor,\" she explained. \"I understand if you don\\'t want me to follow you around tomorrow looking lost,\" he said as they reached his locker. \"I don\\'t mind Troy really,\" she said. \"You sound really interesting and I would love to get to know you more,\" Gabriella said. \"Me too,\" Troy agreed and took the books that he needed to do his homework. \"Do you walk home?\" he asked and closed the door. \"Yeah, you?\" she asked. \"Yes. Do you mind if I walk you home, and we could get to know each other better?\" he suggested. \"I\\'d love too,\" Gabriella replied smiling and they walked out of the school. \"Do you have any siblings?\" Troy asked her. \"No, it\\'s just me and my mom. My dad died when I was young,\" she said. \"I\\'m sorry,\" Troy answered immediately. \"It\\'s ok really. He had been sick for a long time,\" Gabriella said not wanting to make Troy un-comfortable. \"What about you?\" she continued. \"Well I am an only child and home I live with my mom dad and my dad\\'s grand-parents. Here in the states, I live alone,\" he explained. \"So what country are you from?\" Gabriella wondered looking at the boy walking beside her. \"Etrea. It\\'s an island between Australia and Japan a little bigger than Indonesia,\" he told her. \"I\\'ve heard about it. I know a couple of authors from there,\" she said. \"Is there anything you like to do in your free time?\" he questioned not wanting to talk much more about Etrea. \"I study a lot, that is no secret. I am on the scholastic decathlon team at the school with Taylor, but when I\\'m not doing any of that I love to listen to music. What about you?\" she asked. \"I play some basket with my dad, and we have a couple of horses so sometimes I take my horse out just to look around,\" he said. \"That sounds interesting,\" she smiled. \"It is, but I prefer basket. My mom is then one who is riding the most. We have had horses for as long as I can remember,\" he said. \"Do you live on a ranch of some sort?\" she questioned. \"No not exactly, but there is a forest behind our house that is beautiful. It\\'s also amazing to ride into town,\" he explained. They reached Gabriella\\'s house and she stopped. \"This is where I live,\" she said. \"It was really nice to talk to you,\" Troy said. \"You too. See you tomorrow,\" Gabriella said. \"See you tomorrow,\" Troy smiled and he walked towards his own place. Gabriella unlocked the door and looked down the road to see Troy walking before letting herself in. She immediately walked up to her room and grabbed her camera. \"Dear diary, today was the first day back after the holidays and a new guy started in our class. His name is Troy, and I was asked if I could show him around,\" Gabriella started explaining to her video diary. \"I have known him for less than twelve hours but I think we could become great friends. It is only the first day of school but we already have homework. I better get started,\" she said and turned off the camera. She sat down at her desk and pulled out her books and notebooks. Troy continued to walk the last couple of blocks to his own small house. His parents thought it was best that Troy lived in a small house during his time in the USA. They also thought it was convenient if they were going to visit him, or hopefully have a couple of friends over. Troy found the keys in his backpack and opened the door. He walked into the living room and sat down on the sofa. He opened his text books and did the little homework he had. Once finished he walked into the kitchen and made himself some dinner. His mother had given him some recipes before he left. It was so he could make larger portions and freeze them until later. He heated his dinner and sat down eating while watching a re-run of a basketball game. When the clock hit nine he decided to call his mother. He dialled her number and waited. \"Hello Troy,\" she said. \"Hey ma,\" Troy greeted. \"How was your first school day?\" she asked. \"Great. The school is huge, and they defiantly have the school spirit that we see in the movies,\" he explained to his mother. \"Did you get to know anyone?\" she questioned. \"Actually I did. I meet about five new people. This one girl Gabriella she met me at the office and showed me around. We have most of our classes together and we walked together home. She lives just a couple of blocks away,\" Troy explained. \"That\\'s great sweetheart,\" Lucille told her son. \"I just hate that I have to lie to her,\" Troy said. \"I know you do, but it\\'s for the best ok? That was the reason you wanted to stay in the states, to live like a normal teenager,\" she said. \"It is, but once we graduate and I tell them will they really accept that I lied for the past year?\" Troy questioned. \"I can\\'t tell you that. You just have to take it as it comes,\" she said. \"Speaking of isn\\'t it starting to get late?\" she asked. \"It\\'s only nine,\" Troy defended. \"But you\\'re getting up early,\" his mother argued. \"I\\'ll promise to take care of myself,\" Troy told his mother. \"Ok Troy, take care, call me in a couple of days,\" \"I will ma, say hi to the others for me,\" he said. \"I will bye,\" Lucille said and the hung up. Troy decided to go to bed early and shut off all the light before walking into his room and crawling under the covers. That was it and I hope you liked it!

HUGE shoutout to Pumkin king5 for the review in the last chapter! Also a huge shout out to the four people who are currently following the story! It made my day! I have to warn you this chapter is boring, trust me I know, but it had to be like this to stay true to the original story! That is my intention through it all! I want to stay true to the original story but with twists. Enjoy chapter 2! Tuesday, August 21 st , 2008 The next morning Troy awoke at six thirty and got out of bed. He took a quick shower, got dressed and walked into the kitchen to make his breakfast and lunch. He also packed some gym clothes for basketball try-outs before heading to school. He walked past Gabriella\\'s house as she opened the front door. \"God morning,\" he said and she smiled seeing him. \"God morning Troy,\" she said walking up to him. \"So why did you want to come to America for an exchange year?\" Gabriella asked as they walked together towards their High school. \"I wanted to do something new, experience something different,\" he said only telling half the truth. \"I see. What was your old school like?\" she asked curious to find out more about his old life. \"A lot of rich snobbish kids,\" he explained thinking back. \"It doesn\\'t seem to fit you,\" she stated and he smiled. \"No, I had a couple of friends, and one really good friend that weren\\'t like the rest of the people,\" he said not getting into much detail. \"What do you think of East high so far?\" Gabriella asked sensing that he wanted to change the subject. \"So far so good. I like that people are themselves and no trying to be someone else,\" he explained. \"They tried to be someone else? At your old school?\" Gabriella questioned curiously. \"They tried to be better than the others, and when everyone is the same,\" he said and shuddered. \"That doesn\\'t sound fun,\" she said sympathetically and the entered the school. \"It wasn\\'t,\" Troy told her. During the day the group got to know each other more and during free period Troy had tryouts for the basketball team. \"Ok, I have chosen the basketball team for the 07/08 season. Everyone from last year is still in, and the new one this year is Howell, Keele, Bolton and Wild. Practice schedules will be put on the bulletin board outside of my office,\" the coach said and left. \"Congratulations Troy. I have to say I don\\'t really believe what you said about only playing with your dad,\" Chad said putting a hand on his friend\\'s shoulder. \"Thank you Chad, but it\\'s true. My old school didn\\'t have any sort of team or club so it was me and dad playing,\" he said and Chad smiled shaking his head. After the boys had showered and changed they walked to their lockers. The team passed Taylor and Gabriella and Troy stopped to talk to her. \"Will you walk with me home?\" Troy proposed hoping she would say yes. \"Sorry, but I have AP classes this year. Today I have math,\" she told him apologetically. \"Well then. I\\'ll see you tomorrow,\" he said smiling. \"See you tomorrow Troy,\" Gabriella said and Taylor looked at her. \"What?\" she asked her friend looking at her. \"Are you developing a crush?\" Taylor asked and raised her eyebrows. \"Stop it, Taylor, I\\'ve only known him for a day,\" she defended not willing to admit that she already had a crush on him. As the weeks passed by the group had become better and better friends. Troy and Gabriella had become best friends but there was always this guilt inside Troy because he had to lie to her. Troy had gotten an East High hoodie by the basketball team so he could really be a part of the school spirit. After all, he was on the basketball team and the team had voted him and Chad to be co-captains. Troy had been talking to his family back in Etrea regularly and they were all happy for him and how everything had turned out. Wednesday, September 19 th A couple of days ago Troy had stumbled upon a door leading to a rooftop garden. He had learned that it belonged to the science club and was free for everyone to use, but not many knew about it. That morning he left a note in Gabriella\\'s locker and explaining the way to the rooftop and asking if they could meet during lunch. During lunch break, Gabriella came up the stairs and saw Troy there. \"Wow, this is amazing,\" she said looking around amazed. \"It belongs to the science club and everyone can be here, but not many know about it,\" he explained as she was looking around. \"Is there a reason why you brought be up here during lunch?\" she asked turning back to him. \"I wanted to ask you something,\" he started and Gabriella walked up to Troy. Troy took a deep breath before he started talking. \"I haven\\'t been here more than a couple of weeks but you\\'re my best friend,\" he started. \"And you\\'re mine too,\" Gabriella said to him and Troy suddenly had second thoughts about his idea. \"There is something else,\" he said and Gabriella looked at him. Troy was always amazed by her brown eyes but forced himself to look away from her eyes. But just long enough to continue. \"That\\'s the problem… I feel like there is more between us,\" Troy said looking into her eyes again. \"What I\\'m trying to say is I love you, Gabriella,\" he finally admitted. Gabriella smiled and looked at Troy. \"I love you too,\" she said softly looking into his ocean blue eyes. \"Will you be my girlfriend?\" Troy asked taking her hand. For a second Gabriella didn\\'t say anything. Then she leaned in and kissed his lips softly and Troy cupped her cheek as they kissed. \"I\\'d love to,\" she said once they broke the kiss. The new couple sat on the roof talking and eating their lunch together enjoying each others company. \"Hi mom,\" Gabriella said once she walked into the house. \"How was your day hija?\" Maria asked her daughter. \"Great,\" she smiled putting down her backpack. \"You know Troy?\" she asked. \"The boy you were asked to show around?\" she asked and Gabriella nodded. \"He asked me to be his girlfriend today and I said yes,\" she smiled. \"That\\'s great,\" Maria said and gave her a hug. \"I don\\'t believe I have met him?\" Maria asked her daughter. \"No, but he is the guy that I have walked with to and from school. You\\'d love him, and so would daddy,\" Gabriella told her mother. \"If you say he would then I don\\'t have much to worry about. But I would love to meet this guy,\" Maria told her daughter. \"Why don\\'t you invite him over for dinner on Friday?\" her mother asked. \"Sure, is it ok if he comes after school? We have a Spanish project that we need to work on,\" Gabriella explained. \"Of course, do you want to be downstairs or up in your room?\" Maria asked stirring the pot on the stove. \"In my room, I think,\" \"If that\\'s ok?\" she hurried to say. \"Of course just keep the door open,\" Maria smiled. \"Thanks mom,\" Gabriella said and hugged her mom. The two women sat down eating dinner together talking about what else was going on in their lives. After dinner, Gabriella walked up to her room grabbing her camera turning it on. \"Dear diary. Today something amazing happened,\" she started with a big smile. \"Troy left a note in my locker asking if we could meet up on the rooftop garden he had discovered. So when I came up there during lunch he asked me to become his girlfriend! Of course, I said yes but I\\'m nervous. I have never dated anyone before and what happens when the school year is over and he moves back to Etrea? Will we both manage a long distance relationship? I am determined to try,\" I said smiling, before stopping to record. On Thursday during free period Troy found his way to the auditorium. He just managed to escape Chad. The boys were all hanging in the gym playing for fun, and Chad had almost managed to drag him there. Troy, on the other hand, was interested in checking out the audition for the musical. If there was one thing Troy had learned during his time, then it was not to mix the clicks at East High. The \"nerds\" couldn\\'t be seen with the jocks and people stayed in their groups. The furthest the groups mixed was Taylor and Gabriella being seen with the basketball team because Taylor dated Chad. And as Troy had learned there was a big commotion at school when they had found out. Troy snuck in at the back of the auditorium and hid behind a cart the janitor could be seen using. Darbus started clapping to silence the people who had come to audition. \"This is where the true expression of the artist is realised,\" Darbus started telling the students. \"Where inner truth is revealed through the actor\\'s journey…\" Darbus said but was interrupted by a ring. \"Was that a cell phone?!\" she barked out. \"Is it mine?\" the students murmured in the audience. \"No, ma\\'am. That was the warning bell,\" Kelsi said quietly but loud enough for Darbus to hear. \"Ah!\" Darbus realised fixing her glasses before she continued. \"Those wishing to audition must understand that time is of the essence. We have many roles to cast and final callbacks will be next week. First, you will sing a few bars and I will give you a sense of whether or not the theatre is your calling. Better to hear it from me now than from your friends later,\" she said pushing her glasses a little down eying the students. \"Our composer, Kelsi Nielson, will accompany you and be available for rehearsals prior to callbacks. Shall we?\" she questioned making a grand gesture to somewhere between up and towards the piano on her right. Different people auditioned and most of them sang off tune, stuttered and forgot lyrics while singing off tune, one girl even looked to be flirting with Darbus while singing. While watching Troy started to question how the musical was \"Hey,\" a familiar voice said. His head turned and Gabriella stood there. \"So you decided to sign up for something?\" she continued. \"Uh… No. You?\" he stuttered a little. \"No,\" she answered him. \"Um… why are you hiding behind a mop?\" she questioned with a little smile. Troy pushed the cart further away and Gabriella scoffed a little. \"Your friends don\\'t know you\\'re here, right?\" she stated. \"Right,\" he said. The two of them stopped looking at each other and turned their heads towards the stage where the next person was ready to audition. \"Miss Darbus is a little… harsh,\" he said as a girl ran off stage most likely crying. \"The Wildcat superstar\\'s afraid?\" Gabriella questioned surprised using the nickname Troy had gained playing basketball. \"No! I\\'m not afraid, I… I\\'m just… scared,\" he admitted looking at her. \"Me too… usually,\" she revealed to him looking at him before turning her head back to the stage as they heard Darbus speak. \"And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold we only have one couple signed up,\" Darbus said and Troy hurried to take the cart, he previously had pushed away, to hide them both. \"Sharpay and Ryan, I think it might be useful for you to give a sense of why we gather in this hallowed hall,\" Darbus said. From their spot behind the janitor cart they saw Sharpay put a hand on his brother\\'s chest so she could walk on stage first. It was then the two of them decided to sit in the back row. A brief conversation was made between Ryan and Kelsi before Sharpay snapped her fingers and the red curtains closed. The playback started along with their over the top show. Once their show was over Sharpay gave Kelsi a glare and she started clapping and the other soon followed. \"Well. Are there any last-minute sign-ups?\" Darbus asked and Troy and Gabriella snuck out of their seats. \"Buy tickets!\" they heard Ryan tell someone. \"Any last minute sign-ups?\" Darbus called out looking around. \"We should go,\" Troy whispered getting out of his seat. \"No? Good Done,\" Darbus said, turning of the table lamp, taking her bag walking away from the table. \"I\\'d like to audition, Miss Darbus\" Gabriella called to her homeroom teacher not seeing Troy\\'s frustrated and shocked reaction. \"Timelines means something in the world of theatre, young lady. The individual auditions are long over and there are simply no other pairs,\" she told her. \"I\\'ll sing with her,\" Troy said with a raised hand revealing himself. \"Troy Bolton. Where is your sports posse or whatever it\\'s called?\" she questioned sceptically surprised to see him there. \"Team,\" he corrected his teacher looking at her. \"Ah,\" she said nodding. \"But I\\'m here alone. Actually, I\\'m here to sing with her,\" he said. \"Yes, well, we take these shows very seriously here at East High,\" she told them walking closer. \"I called for the pairs audition, and you didn\\'t respond. Free period is now over,\" she said walking past them. \"She has an amazing voice,\" Troy said trying to help out his girlfriend. \"Perhaps the next musicale,\" Darbus told them walking away Up on the stage Kelsi gathered her notes and was going to get off the bench when she tripped and all her notes was scattered on the floor. Both of them hurried down and helped her. \"So, you\\'re a composer?\" Troy asked. Kelsi just looked at him. \"You wrote the song Ryan and Sharpay just sang?\" he continued not caring that she didn\\'t say anything previously. \"And the entire show?\" he asked giving her the notes he had collected. To this Kelsi gave a tiny nod not looking away. \"Well, that\\'s really cool,\" he told her. \"I can\\'t wait to hear the rest of the show,\" he said offering his hand as she was about to stand up. \"So why are you so afraid of Ryan and Sharpay?\" he asked the clearly intimidated girl. \"I mean, it is your show,\" he stated easily. \"It is?\" she questioned un certainly. \"Isn\\'t the composer of a show kind of like the playmaker in basketball?\" he asked her. \"Playmaker?\" she asked confused frowning a little. \"You know the one who makes everyone else look good,\" he tried to explain. \"Without you there is no show. You\\'re the playmaker here, Kelsi,\" he said to her. \"I am?\" she asked smiling a little and Troy nodded. \"You want to hear how the duet\\'s supposed to sound?\" she asked getting excited taking a seat behind the piano. She started on the first line and looked at the couple as Troy started singing. After a couple of lines, Kelsi lead Gabriella into the music. \"Wow. That\\'s nice,\" Troy said a couple of seconds after Kelsi had hit the last chord. \"Bolton, Montez you have a callback. Kelsi give them the duet from the second act,\" Darbus yelled from the other side of the auditorium. \"Work on it with them,\" she said putting on her glasses. \"All right!\" Kelsi said excited. \"If you guys wanna rehearse, I\\'m usually here during free period and after school and even sometimes during biology class. You can come and rehearse anytime. Or come to my house for breakfast. I have a piano, we can rehearse there. After school, before school – whatever works. After basketball class….\" She said to them overly excited. \"What just happened?\" Troy questioned as they walked out of the auditorium. \"Darbus was listening to us,\" Gabriella stated looking at her boyfriend. \"Do you want to do the callback?\" Troy questioned her. \"Yeah. What about you?\" she questioned. \"I don\\'t really sing…\" he said trailing off. \"I have a hard time believing that after what I saw today,\" Gabriella smiled. \"Yeah sure. My shower head is really impressed,\" he laughed making Gabriella laugh too. \"Why did you suddenly decide on audition?\" he continued as they walked towards their lockers. \"I don\\'t know. I have been singing in a choir before but when I was singing solo I remember looking at the audience and the next thing I was looking at the ceiling. That was the end of my solo career,\" she said smiling a little embarrassed about the memory. \"After what I heard five minutes ago I have a hard time believing that,\" he told her. \"Oh well,\" she shrugged opening her locker taking out her lunch. That was it! Hope you all liked it! I would really appreciate if you could leave a review to tell me what you though! Also, do you think it\\'s long to wait two weeks for a chapter? I\\'m curious... FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 3] ['HUGE shoutout to Pumking king5 and my good IRL friend The Princess of Books for reviewing. You guys keep me going! Also thanks to you who are favouriting and following the story! I love getting reviews and I know how many who are reading so is it possible to get a couple of more reviews/opinions on the story? I know alot from last chapter was directly quoted from the movie but it fitted. I don\\'t own anything related to Disney or High School Musical. The only thing I own is Etrea and things acociated with that. Enjoy! Friday 21st of September The next morning a loud scream could be heard all over East High. \"Call-backs!\" Sharpay yelled frantically. \"Aah!\" she screamed. \"Callbacks for roles Arnold and Minnie next Thursday, 3:50 PM,\" Ryan started reading. Sharpay and Ryan Evans, Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton,\" Ryan read out. \"Is this some kind of joke? They didn\\'t even audition!\" she exclaimed. \"Maybe we\\'re being punked?\" Ryan asked. \"What?\" Sharpay questioned frowning. \"Maybe we\\'re being filmed right now. Maybe we\\'ll get to meet Ashton!\" Ryan said shaking his sister\\'s hand. \"Oh, shut up, Ryan!\" Sharpay replied angrily. The basketball team who was listening laughed. \"What\\'s wrong?\" Chad asked reading the pink paper. \"What?\" Chad questioned looking at Ryan then back at the paper. \"Uhh!\" Sharpay said stomping away before Chad too walked away from the group. Chad found Troy in the gym during one of their breaks. \"Hey hoops,\" Chad said and got his friends attention. \"Hi,\" Troy said taking the ball as it re-bounced to him. \"So did you hear the ice princess this morning?\" Chad questioned. \"No? Was I supposed to?\" he questioned passing the ball to Chad. \"I don\\'t know. I suppose so,\" he said bouncing the ball before taking it again. \"What do you talk about?\" Troy questioned. \"Minnie and Arnold,\" Chad said looking at his friend to judge his reaction. \"Oh that,\" he said getting the ball from Chad. \"Yeah that,\" Chad said. \"I didn\\'t know you could sing?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t do it that much really. It was a spur of the moment kind of thing,\" he tried to explain. \"So the fact that you sang with Gabriella didn\\'t mean anything?\" Chad clarified. \"No,\" Troy said trying to shoot but hit the backboard before the ball bounced back to him. Troy jogged off to retrieve it before walking back to his friend. \"The singing wasn\\'t a spur of the moment but not planned either. I don\\'t know how better to explain it,\" Troy said. \"Just a fair warning that the jocks aren\\'t seen with the drama freaks,\" Chad told his friend. \"I told you Chad I don\\'t know how it happened,\" he defended himself. \"Tell me then,\" Chad challenged. Troy took a breath and told Chad about everything from when he said no to the basketball to him meeting Gabriella in the auditorium and then ending up in the callbacks. \"Wow,\" Chad said. \"That\\'s strange,\" he said. \"Do you even want to?\" he questioned. \"The strange thing is that I think I do,\" \"I mean if we get the part,\" he added and Chad nodded. \"So you remember what is happening next Friday?\" Chad questioned. \"Of course. The game against North high,\" Troy said. \"Got to keep your head in the game,\" Troy stated making Chad laugh. \"Now come on\\',\" Chad said stealing the ball from Troy and the two boys started messing around playing just for fun. After homeroom that Friday Troy and Gabriella walked out of there and put their stuff in the lockers grabbing their Spanish books. Their friends had been thrilled when they told them about their growing relationship earlier that day. The couple walked hand in hand towards Gabriella\\'s house. \"I\\'m nervous to meet your mother,\" Troy said looking at her while they walked. \"It will be fine. You should get along great,\" Gabriella reassured her boyfriend. They reached her house and walked inside. \"Hello,\" Maria greeted coming out from the kitchen. \"Hi mom,\" Gabriella said giving her a hug. \"Mom this is Troy. Troy this is my mother Maria,\" Gabriella introduced. \"It\\'s so nice to meet you, Troy,\" Maria said shaking his hand. \"Likewise,\" Troy smiled. \"Gabriella told me you had a project going on, so I\\'m going to let you work on that,\" she said smiling at the two teens. \"Thanks, mom. We\\'ll be up in my room,\" Gabriella said and Maria walked back into the kitchen. \"Come on,\" Gabriella said taking his hand guiding him upstairs. \"This is my room,\" she said opening the white door. Troy looked around her room. It was nothing like he had seen before. The rooms were medium sized and her walls were a green colour and filled with pictures of her friends and other memories. She had double French doors leading out to a small balcony. Her bed was a normal sized double bed with pillars that were draped with a soft cream coloured fabric. She also had a white desk and bookshelf. Her bookshelves were filled with different books and Troy recognised some of them as being Etrean authors. \"Do you read a lot?\" he asked shifting his gaze from her bookshelf back to her. \"Yeah, my favourite book is this,\" she said handing him a blue book with golden letters. It was a nonfiction book named Stars of Magic by Maryl LaflammeTroy knew the author all too well. She was a friend of his family and she had written a book about the royal family when Troy was fourteen. Hopefully, Gabriella hadn\\'t read that book. \"Have you heard about her?\" she asked bringing him out of his thoughts. \"Yeah, I have,\" he said putting the book back on the shelf still looking at all her books. \"We should probably start our assignment,\" Gabriella said sitting down on the bed. Troy also sat down and they took out their Spanish books starting on their project. An hour later Maria walked up the stairs but stopped when she heard laughter. It warmed her heart that someone could make her daughter so happy. When she walked to the door they were just sitting in bed with their books open laughing. \"Troy, Gabriella, dinner is ready,\" she said. \"Thanks, mom. We\\'ll be down in just a second,\" Gabriella said. \"Honestly Troy? You need to strengthen your vocabulary,\" she smiled. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he smiled laughing too about his word choice. \"Come on,\" Gabriella said getting off the bed. Troy gave her a kiss before they walked downstairs. They sat down at the table and Maria put a dish on the table that Troy had never seen before. \"This is one of my favourite dishes. It is inspired by all the Mexicans living here in New Mexico. This is Stacked enchiladas with green chilli,\" Gabriella explained. \"I have never heard of this,\" Troy admitted curious about the food on the table. \"It is almost like tortilla you use for ataco, but already filled with meat and sauce,\" Gabriella explained trying to give him a better understanding of what it was. \"It smells amazing,\" Troy said as the smell was all around the kitchen. \"Digg in,\" Maria said putting the spoon in the dish. \"Gabriella told me you\\'re not from here,\" Maria said while they ate. \"Yeah,\" Troy started not knowing how to approach this. \"I\\'m from Etrea. My whole family is from there,\" Troy said not revealing much. \"What is it like?\" Maria wondered curiously about his home country. \"It\\'s wonderful. Very peaceful. There is this annual parade during the spring when the threes blossom. It is celebrated because we believe it will bring good luck for the country. The book you have Stars of Magic is inspired by the festival,\" Troy explained. \"It sounds like you know a lot,\" Maria said and Gabriella gave her mother a look. \"It\\'s common knowledge for most Etrean people. They learn it at a young age,\" he said easily. \"It sounds like people in your country has a broad knowledge of culture and history,\" Maria stated. \"They do. Etrea is a fertile land with easy access to fresh fruit and vegetables, and has a special history and culture,\" he said hoping he hadn\\'t said too much. \"I would love to visit it someday,\" Gabriella said sensing Troy\\'s discomfort. \"It sounds amazing,\" she continued. \"This was delicious Maria,\" Troy complimented. \"I\\'m glad you liked it, Troy,\" Maria smiled relieved. \"Do you need any help cleaning?\" Troy offered once everyone was finished. \"No thank you, Troy,\" Maria said touched by his thoughtfulness. \"Let\\'s go upstairs and finish,\" Gabriella said and they once again walked back upstairs and continued on their project. \"My mom really likes you,\" Gabriella said once they sat down on the bed. \"I\\'m glad,\" Troy smiled. His phone started beeping and he looked at it before closing it. His girlfriend looked at him when he looked back up. \"It was my mom,\" he explained. \"You can talk to her,\" Gabriella said nudging towards the phone that was beside him. \"She was probably wondering how it was here. I\\'ll call her once I get home,\" he told her. \"Ok. Then it was Spanish,\" Gabriella said and they continued to work. At eight their project was done and they had been talking for the past half an hour. \"I think I should head home,\" Troy said and got up from the bed collecting his stuff. \"I\\'ll see you at school,\" Gabriella said and gave her boyfriend a kiss on the lips. They walked downstairs and Troy said goodbye to Maria before walking home. When Troy came home that day he called his mother. He had sent her a text earlier but he wanted to talk to her. \"Hello mom,\" he said once she picked up. \"How was your day?\" she asked her son. \"Great! It was fun seeing how it was like in a normal family, and Maria made the best enchiladas. It\\'s like a tortilla with meat and cheese,\" he tried to explain to his mother. \"That sounds good,\" she said and Troy could hear the smile in her voice. Monday 24th of September On Monday before school started Gabriella meet Kelsi to practise for their callbacks the following Thursday. \"You sound great!\" Kelsi exclaimed after they had sung through he song. \"I don\\'t know,\" Gabriella said doubtfully looking at her classmate. \"I\\'m sure Gabriella trust me. You and Troy will get the part!\" Kelsi said. \"I\\'m just happy it\\'s on Thursday,\" Gabriella said relieved. \"Oh?\" Kelsi questioned not getting what she meant. \"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"The declaration team has a match on Friday. We need to pass this to qualify to compete for a chance in the finals. Besides the basketball team has the championship game that day,\" Gabriella explained. \"I\\'m sure everything will work out. But probably shouldn\\'t mention it to Sharpay,\" Kelsi said smiling a little. \"Yeah,\" Gabriella agreed nodding. \"Now what do you say to go through it once more?\" Kelsi asked and they continued to rehearse. After school, Gabriella and Taylor had a meeting with the declaration team preparing for the upcoming contest while Troy rehearsed with Kelsi. When Wednesday came around Kelsi sat behind the piano in the auditorium during lunch. \"Ms Darbus the callbacks are on Thursday, but as the president of the drama club, I think it would be best if we moved it to Friday,\" Sharpay said not noticing the pianist behind the piano. \"Are you sure?\" Darbus questioned uncertainly. \"Of course. I would only do what is best for the drama department,\" Sharpay said determined with a fake smile. \"Of course you would Miss Evans,\" Darbus said. \"Fabulous,\" she smiled walking off. Kelsi dropped her pencil and dunked her head on the piano. On Thursday morning she stood in front of the information board at East high. \"What is going on?\" Troy asked once he saw Kelsi there. \"The callbacks are at the same time as the game?\" he asked shocked. \"And the declaration competition?\" Gabriella added upset. \"What did Darbus do,\" Chad said angrily. \"Well there was two rats and neither of them is named Darbus,\" Kelsi said. \"Do you know anything little person?\" Chad questioned looking down at Kelsi. \"Darbus isn\\'t waring pink or designer clothes,\" Kelsi said and the others immediately understood her message. \"Why would Sharpay do such things?\" Chad asked. \"She stated that she wanted to protect the Drama department, but in reality, all she wanted was to protect herself,\" Kelsi said looking at the small group there. \"There is nothing we can do about it,\" Kelsi added frustrated and a little sad. \"No no-way. I am not letting her win! We can do it but only if we\\'re all in this together,\" Gabriella said putting her hand in. One after one Chad, Taylor, Zeke, Jason and Kelsi put their hands in. The only one left was Troy. Troy\\'s POV I was seriously doubted about this as people put their hands in. What if someone found out who I am by this? What would my parents and grand-parents think if they found out? Deciding to live with the possible consequences I put my hand in. \"This is my plan,\" Gabriella said starting to explain. So that was it for now! I hope you all enjoyed it. I wrote the last part just now and I apologize for any spelling mistakes since the clock is 00:30 am. Please, please leave a review with your thoughts! FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 4] ['I\\'m so so sorry! I know this should have been up last Saturday. I hit a little writers block, and our class have been preparing a return visit for our Dutch exhange school. A huge shoutout to Pumkingking5 for review agian! A moment of seriousness people. I am over the moon about how many readers I have on this story but when I check the reviews I feel a little bumed. I am doubting this story and how it is turning out, so can you please leave a review? I woul LOVE to read what you thing. That\\'s all I ask you for is a small comment on what you think about the story. Thanks for reading this! Thursday September 27 th Gabriella\\'s POV For the rest of the day we arranged how Troy and I could be on time for our competitions and the callbacks. Our plan should work perfectly if we did it correctly. I was sitting on the bed in my room reading Stars of Magic when a thought crossed my mind. Troy said he knew about her but what had she written that interested him? Therefor I opened my laptop and googled Maryl Laflamme. Several books popped up and her most recent once was a drama book named Angel of The World and Whisper of Dreams , but neither of them crossed me as books Troy would be interested in. I decided to scrolled a little further down and saw that she had written a book about the royal family in Etrea named A biography about the Royal Family: Their stories. Deciding against clicking on it, I thought that Troy would tell me a thing or two about it. Besides there was no reason to read this the day before the competition. I opened the drawer on my nightstand and found my camera to make another entry. \"Today it is Thursday, September 27th and I just found out that the callbacks have been moved till tomorrow. The same day as the declaration competition and Troy\\'s basketball match against North High. You can take one guess at who it was. None other than Sharpay Evans, the president of the Drama club. All she wants to is to protect herself even though she states that she is doing what is best for the drama department,\" I said into the camera. \"I really hope me and Troy could pull this off. It would be really fun to act in the musical but I\\'m slightly nervous too. Why is it so hard for me to sing in front of people, but not writing up solutions and answers to a bunch of questions on a board?\" I questioned myself before continuing. \"Besides the drama with Sharpay everything is doing great,\" I said smiling. \"On Friday Troy was over meeting my mom and we worked on our Spanish project,\" I said and laughed a little. \"Apparently he has never had Spanish before so I have to say he is pretty good except the occasional word choice mistakes,\" I laughed. \"Anyways I love you Troy,\" I said with a giggle before turning the camera off. Seeing that it had a low battery so I found the charger and plugged it in. I read over my notes for the competition tomorrow and the lyrics for the audition. When I looked up again the clock was twelve thirty. \"Where did the time go?\" I mumbled and gathered all the papers, putting them in my backpack. I put my backpack by the door to my room before I went to bed, falling asleep at once. When I awoke the next morning I was excited yet terrified about the day. So much was at stake! I got dressed and made sure I had all my notes and books for the day and various competitions and auditions. \"God morning Gabriella,\" mom greeted me once I came downstairs. \"Morning mom,\" I said as I started making my lunch. \"I have a meeting today but I\\'ll try and make it to the declaration competition today,\" she said to me. \"When are you going?\" she asked. \"First,\" I told her pouring cereal into a bowl for breakfast. \"I\\'ll do my best to make it,\" she promised as I poured milk into the cereal. I found a spoon and started eating while mom and I made small talk. I looked up at the clock and panicked. \"Oh no, I\\'m late,\" I said and put the bowl into the sink. \"I\\'m leaving now; would you like me to give you a ride?\" she asked. \"Yes please,\" I said and made sure I had everything. I put on my black marry jane shoes and jacket before mom and I walked out of the house. Five minutes later she dropped me of outside of East High just in time. I hurried inside and towards my locker where I saw Troy standing, looking at his watch. \"Sorry I\\'m late. I don\\'t know how it happened,\" I said spinning my combination. \"Well I\\'m just glad you\\'re here,\" he smiled and I laughed. \"The highlight of your day?\" I asked sarcastically and Troy nodded. \"Yes actually,\" he answered seriously looking at my face. \"You\\'re serious?\" I asked surprised taking out my geography books. \"Why yes?\" he questioned raising an eyebrow. \"Never mind,\" I said with a little smile shutting my locker door. \"How is your team looking?\" I asked him curios as we walked down the halls. \"Great. We\\'re ready to take down North High and fight for a chance in the championship game. What about your and Taylor\\'s team?\" he asked equally interested. \"Great!\" I said closing the door. \"Our minds are sharp and full of un-useful stuff that have a high value for us,\" I said and Troy laughed. Oh boy I loved that sound. It was my favourite sound and every time I would smile. \"You crack me up,\" he laughed and we walked into our classroom just in the nick of time. People were sitting in the room as we heard the cheers of the mascot outside, followed by a bunch of fans and a small group from the band group, walking by. I looked up at the stands and saw my mom take a seat subtly smiling at me. Taylor, me and the two others all had on a lab coat look-a-like coat with a red ribbon indicating our team. I was standing by the table talking quietly to Taylor. \"Everything is set?\" I asked her quietly. \"Yes,\" she said confirming. \"Great,\" I said and walked up to the wooden framed white board. I grabbed the black marker and took one last look at Taylor who nodded confidently at me. At exactly 3:50PM we were given the questions and started writing down the answers. I knew the answer so it was just a matter of fact to write it down on the board correctly. I put in the last answer and stopped the clock. I could feel everyone in the audience look at me as the judge walked over to my board. He looked at my answers and back at his cards. He looked up once again and time couldn\\'t pass more slowly. Finally, he nodded approving lifting his hand gesturing towards us. \"Yes!\" Taylor cheered and we share a group hug as the small audience clapped. As we sat at the table Taylor opened the small black laptop and entered the codes pressing enter. She and Chad had gone together to wire the PC to the gym\\'s score board. We were really careful not to break anything because that was the last thing we wanted! \"Time for the Wildcats to make an orderly exit from the gym,\" Taylor said quietly pressing enter and the words transmitting code was shown. Taylor closed the laptop smiling confidently as a beaker with a blue substance was boiling. It was starting to smell and we were coughing by the horrible smell. The audience soon started and the judge stood up gaining everyone attention. \"Please could we make an exit to the school\\'s auditorium,\" he said and I hurried out in the chaos. I ran down the hallways towards the auditorium. \"The callback lists will be up on Monday thank you,\" Ms. Darbus said as I ran into the auditorium. \"Please Ms. Darbus! We\\'re here,\" I called as I came running down towards the stage, and onto it, along with Troy. \"We\\'re here.\" Troy said as he too stood on the stage beside Darbus and Sharpay. \"I\\'m sorry but rules are rules...\" her voice was drowned by the crowd entering from the game and scholastic decathlon competition. \"We\\'ll be happy to do it again,\" Sharpay said looking dreamily over the large audience. \"I cannot believe this,\" Darbus said amazed. \"I\\'m sorry but we don\\'t have a pianist,\" Darbus said sadly. \"I guess that\\'s showbiz,\" Sharpay\\'s bitchy remark came. \"We will sing without a pianist,\" I begged her. \"Oh no you won\\'t! Pianist here Ms. Darbus!\" Kelsi reported standing beside Darbus. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" Sharpay spat towards her. \"Oh I\\'m sure. Ready on stage!\" she challenged. \"Now that\\'s showbiz!\" Darbus exclaimed getting off the stage. Troy handed me a microphone and I took one look at the audience as Kelsi started playing. I knew exactly when to start but as I opened my mouth, I froze, before closing it again. Troy looked at me and I whispered to him; \"I can\\'t do it,\" I said turning to leave the stage. \"Hey look at me, right at me. You can do it ok? Just like at the auditions. Just you and me,\" he said to me and pointed at Kelsi, who started to play again. This time it was Troy who started to sing, and suddenly it wasn\\'t so scary anymore. It was as he had told me a moment ago. It was just the two of us, like the audition. I started singing my part and we just had fun on the stage. The moon was lowered and we just danced around on the stage being ourselves. Nothing was choreographed and we were carefree in that moment. When the song was about to end, we suddenly came back to reality. People were watching us differently than we saw each other but that was ok. All because we broke free. That was it! I will try to update next Saturday but I can not promisse anything because of our school\\'s Dutch exhange program. Pleas, pleas leave a review and tell me what you think. Again thanks for reading. FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 5] ['I\\'m back! Sorry for the long wait but school is crazy with the year soon ending and last minute test along with exams! I also hit writers block and I didn\\'t plan on the chapter being this long but I knew exactly how to end it! (OMG it\\'s over 3400 words long!) I don\\'t own Disney, High school musical or the movies mentioned in this story. The only thing I own is Troy\\'s grand-parents and Etrea. HUGE shout out to pumkinking5 for constantly reviewing it makes my day! Please read and review telling me what you thing because I know you guys read it ;) Without further ado her is chapter 5! Monday October 15 th Gabriella\\'s POV It had been almost two weeks since Troy and I had auditioned and gotten the part! Sharpay had been more friendly towards us all, and was actually helping us. It was the last class for the day, English. Troy and I had been extremely busy because of the audition. Both of our teams went through the qualifications and was in the competition. Our declaration team was working harder than ever, and so was the basketball team. The bell finally rang and everyone hurried to pack up their stuff, ready for the day to end. \"Remember your homework!\" our teacher called to us as we walked out. I meet Troy outside of the classroom and he smiled. \"So what do you have planned for the week-end?\" I questioned was we walked down the red and white hallways towards our lockers. \"You do know that it is Monday today?\" he asked me and I laughed. \"As a matter of fact I do know that,\" I said to him as we stopped by our lockers. \"I wanted to know, because I was wondering if you wanted to watch a movie this weekend?\" I questioned. \"Defiantly,\" he said without a moment of hesitation. \"Which one?\" he questioned. \"I don\\'t know yet. There are no good movies playing right now so I will see what I have at my house. I just miss spending time with you,\" I stated and he took my hand. I looked up at his smiling face which made my heart soar and I felt butterflies in my stomach. \"I miss spending time with you too,\" he told me as we walked out hand in hand. \"We\\'re both so busy now between school and the after school activities we just have to make the best of it,\" he said with a little sigh. \"What was your favourite Disney movie growing up?\" I questioned him changing the subject and I saw Troy frown. \"I didn\\'t watch much Disney or movies for that matter when I was little. I did other things,\" he told me not getting into detail. \"You have never watched a Disney film?\" I asked him in disbelief. \"What other things did you do?\" I questioned him wondering how he hadn\\'t watched Disney. \"I don\\'t know how,\" he said to me thinking. He almost never answered questions about his past and he brushed it off. \"When I think about it I have seen The Sword in the Stone, but that was for a small project when I was seven,\" he told me and I was not going to lie, I was a little shocked. \"You got to be kidding!\" I exclaimed. \"You have never seen Cinderella, sleeping beauty, The little mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or even The Lion king?\" I questioned trying to remind him if he had seen them. \"No. Can\\'t say I have heard much about either of them,\" he said to me shrugging his shoulders. \"Ok I know what we are seeing this week-end,\" I told him determinately as we were coming closer and closer to our road. \"What?\" he questioned confused looking down at me. \"Not going to tell you, but do know that it will be a Disney movie, and yes a kid\\'s one,\" I smirked. \"I guess I could live with it,\" he said to me as we saw my house coming closer. \"See you tomorrow morning?\" he asked me as we stood on the sidewalk while the wind started to pick up around us. \"I\\'m sorry but I promised to meet Taylor in the morning to go over some stuff for the Decathlon team. I will see you at first period,\" I promised him. \"Ok, see you in the morning,\" he said and we parted ways. I got out my keys and unlocked the front door before entering. Mom was on a trip but was due home on Thursday. I had already talked to her about Troy coming over this week-end, and she had agreed. I sat down at the kitchen table starting my mountain of homework and preparation for the decathlon team. At nine in the evening I placed a bookmark before I closed my textbook. I looked down at my phone and saw an un-read text from Troy. I opened it smiling while reading it. He was so sweet. I sent him a quick text back before I walked downstairs and made myself some dinner. After eating I went back upstairs and re-opened my textbook trying to finish my AP calculus work. I heard a distant sound. It was like a phone ringing but who owned it? I questioned. Suddenly I realised that it was mine! I lifted my head and looked around as I wasn\\'t in my bed. I had fallen asleep while doing my homework. I took my phone that was beside me and saw that it was Taylor. \"It\\'s Gabi,\" I answered trying to sound awake even though I was dead tired. \"Gabriella where are you? Everyone except you are here!\" she exclaimed and I heard she was frustrated. \"What time is it?\" I questioned confused not having a clock nearby. \"It\\'s seven thirty, where are you?\" she asked again clearly annoyed this time. \"I just woke up, I fell asleep doing my homework yesterday,\" I told her as I got up from my desk grabbing a couple of items I needed for the day. \"I\\'ll be there as soon as I can,\" I promised and hung up. I hurried to get dressed before I grabbed all my books shoving them into my backpack before leaving. Troy\\'s POV Both Gabriella and Taylor got into the classroom just as the bell was sounded. She sent me a small smile before taking her seat in the back. \"Ok class today we are starting our book analyses…\" Mrs Moscow our English teacher said starting her class. After a double class of choice, we all meet in the cafeteria for lunch. I sat down beside Gabriella who just looked exhausted. \"You ok?\" I asked her quietly and she nodded. \"Yeah, I just slept in this morning missing most of the meeting with the decathlon team,\" she told me. \"Your mom didn\\'t wake you in time?\" I questioned her but she shook her head stifling a yawn. \"No. It\\'s just that she\\'s out on a company trip in Salt Lake City for the time being. She knows your coming this week-end and she\\'ll be home by then,\" she assured me. \"I would never dub-out you,\" I said and we joined the other\\'s conversation. Friday November 19 th School was out and we were on our way towards Gabriella\\'s house. \"So mom got caught up at work and isn\\'t home now, but she is coming sometime this evening,\" Gabriella said to me while we walked hand in hand home. \"I thought she was supposed to come home yesterday?\" I questioned and she sighed. \"I\\'m used to this happening. If she says she is coming home on a specific date, I always anticipate her coming home at least one day later. She is home late from work to some days. Say\\'s it\\'s important meetings and what not. The bright side is that she almost never works during the week-end and that is when we do stuff together,\" she smiled and I felt sorry for her. My parents and grand-parents were both extremely busy at times, but it sounded like I spent more time with all four of them than she did with her own mother. \"I\\'m sorry to hear that Brie,\" I told her genuinely. \"No problem Troy. You can\\'t do anything about it,\" she said to me as we were now by her house. She took out her keys and opened the door. Once we were both inside she locked it again. \"I always do that when I\\'m home alone during the night,\" she explained to me. \"Don\\'t worry. I understand,\" I reassured her and we took our shoes and jackets off. \"By the sounds of it we\\'re making our own dinner did you have anything planed?\" I questioned. \"Not really. My thoughts were what we could do with some chicken,\" she told me and I got an idea. \"Do you have noodles and some cabbage?\" I questioned and she looked at me like I was crazy. \"Yes I know we have noodles and I think I saw some cabbage yesterday. Why do you ask?\" she questioned me sceptically. \"Do you trust me?\" I asked with a little smile and she nodded. \"Of course,\" she said. \"Then I could make some Etrean food if you want to taste?\" I asked her. \"I\\'d love to put what are you trying to make?\" she asked knowing how he was at cooking. \"Something called Yakisoba Chicken. It is actually one thing I know how to make,\" I assured her. \"Let\\'s get at it,\" she said and together we had fun making dinner. Half an hour we put the food on the table and the smell of home hit me. \"This is Yakisoba Chicken. Noodles with chicken, cabbage, onion, carrots, some chilli and garlic,\" I said to her. \"It\\'s smells amazing. Reminding me of Japan,\" she said to me looking up from the dish. \"A lot of Etrean food are a combination or inspired by Japan and Australia,\" I explained to her as she took some of the food putting it in her bowl. She picked up her spoon and smelled it before she took a bite. \"Mmm, this is amazing,\" she praised as I tasted the flavours just as I remembered them. \"I\\'m glad you like it,\" I told her as we talked while eating, sharing stories from our childhood. Of course I didn\\'t tell her stuff that could reveal who I really was, but I desperately wanted her to know! I needed to talk to mom and dad tomorrow. 3 rd person POV \"Ok so the movie we\\'re watching tonight is one of my all-time favourites,\" Gabriella told her boyfriend as he was sitting on the sofa waiting for her to reveal her pick. \"It came out in 1994 and, as you might have predicted, a Disney movie,\" she said giving him the DVD. \" The Lion King, \" he read giving it back to her. Gabriella opened the case and popped it into the DVD player starting it. They had made popcorn that was in a bowl on the coffee table in front of them along with soda. Gabriella sat down beside her boyfriend as the movie started showing the intro and Circle of life song with Simba\\'s baptising. Gabriella took a quick glance up at her boyfriend to see him frown slightly about the un-usual movie where animals were talking and doing things they shouldn\\'t be able to do. The part of the movie that entertained Troy the most, and found most ironic, had to be the part with Simba, Nala and Zazul on their way to the waterhole when Simba started to sing I can\\'t wait to be king . \"You thought that was funny?\" Gabriella questioned as she heard Troy laugh quietly when Zazul got crushed under the rhino. \"Surprisingly yes. It\\'s brilliant by Simba,\" he said and Gabriella snuggled into him as they watched the rest of the movie together. When Maria parked her car in front of the house at one that night she found the house mostly dark and quiet. She got out of her black car, picking up her bag before locking her car. She found her keys and entered the house as quietly as she could. She walked into the house and it didn\\'t look much different from when she left. She walked into the kitchen to look inside the fridge to see how urgent she needed to do grocery shopping. She was surprised to see a pot inside. She lifted off the lid and smelled the cold food. She had no idea Gabriella could make that type of food so she suspected her and Troy making dinner together. Maria saw light in the living room and walked into it but stopped in the doorway seeing the two teens curled up together on the sofa. She picked up a blanket from the ottoman and draped it around the couple not having the heart to wake them up. She figured it wouldn\\'t be a problem for Troy staying the night since he was living alone. She walked over to turn the TV off and noticed the DVD on the coffee table. She picked it up and turned it, smiling when she saw what they have been watching. A little un-usual she though, but again Gabriella loved that movie and by the looks of it they both had enjoyed a quiet night together traveling back into their childhoods. With a smile on her face she walked up to her bedroom and into her bed. Saturday November 3 rd A couple of weeks later it was the first weekend in November and Gabriella had invited Troy to go camping with her. It was something the gang enjoyed doing together and Gabriella had learned that Troy hadn\\'t done before. Troy was really looking forward to it and after talking to his mother and father, they had agreed that Gabriella needed to know who he really was. He was going to tell her that he was the prince of Etrea. That Saturday Gabriella knocked on the door to his house at three in the afternoon. \"Hi Brie,\" he said smiling. \"Come \\'on in,\" he said letting her in the house. She had never actually been inside before and was impressed at how tidy it was. For some reason she imagined that Troy didn\\'t clean his house often, but by the looks of it he did. \"Are you ready?\" she asked him looking at the backpack that was by the door. \"Yeah, just getting the last couple of things,\" he said opening the fridge taking out a big bottle of water before finding matches. \"There,\" he told his smiling girlfriend. Troy picked up his backpack and they walked towards the mountains. \"Have you been here often?\" he asked on their way up the trail. \"A couple of times. Our gang is here from time to time,\" she explained stopping for a second to wait on him. An hour later they were at the top of the mountain overlooking the city. \"Wow, it\\'s beautiful,\" Troy said, a little out of breath, but amazed looking down at Albuquerque. \"Just wait until it gets dark,\" she said and smiled looking at Troy. \"Should we start setting up a camp?\" Gabriella asked walking over to where they could set up their camp. \"Good idea. What do we do?\" he asked feeling a little stupid for not knowing. \"Could you find some wood for the campfire? Just don\\'t go too far and walk carefully,\" she advised him. \"Will do,\" he said and began his search. In the meantime, Gabriella quickly set up the tent and found some rocks for the holes in the fire pit. Troy arrived back with lots of wood that he put down by the fire pit. \"Have you made a fire before?\" Gabriella questioned looking at him. \"No,\" Troy told her sheepishly. \"No problem. Then this could be your first,\" she said and found some of the smallest pieces. Gabriella instructed Troy how to make the fire and when it lit, it continued to burn. \"Great job,\" Gabriella smiled and Troy laughed. It was getting fairly dark now and the couple sat down by the fire talking and Gabriella thought him how to make smores. \"Should we sleep outside tonight?\" Gabriella asked as she was munching on a smore. \"I thought we were?\" he asked confused. \"Under the stars. I have put up a tent, but I know the weather is supposed to be good, maybe a little cold, so we could sleep outside of the tent\" she explained to him. \"I\\'m game,\" Troy said and placed his hand around Gabriella. She leaned into him and they kissed with the soft glow of the fire. It started getting colder and they put on more clothes. \"You cold?\" Troy asked seeing his girlfriend shiver. \"A little,\" she admitted. She hadn\\'t packed warm enough clothes because she underestimated the weather. Troy put her between his legs and she leaned into him while he wrapped his hands around her trying to keep her warm. They warmed sausages over the fire and had fun talking. Troy found a blanket and wrapped it around her. \"Thank you,\" Gabriella said gratefully. \"I heard that they suspected it was getting colder than they actually said. Therefore, I packed extra clothes just in case,\" he said. \"I should have checked,\" she said defeated. \"Don\\'t think about it Brie,\" he said kissing her head softly. When they went to sleep late that night Gabriella still had the blanked from Troy as she crawled into her sleeping bag feeling warm. They lay close to each other and looked up at the stars. \"This is wonderful,\" Troy said enjoying himself. \"I can\\'t believe you have never done this before,\" Gabriella said looking at him. \"I don\\'t know why I hasn\\'t done this before,\" Troy told her really knowing the reason. \"But I\\'m glad you asked me,\" he continued. \"Good night,\" Gabriella said sleepily. \"Good night,\" Troy said seeing her eyes close. Troy could never have done this back in Etrea. There he had to have security with him everywhere, and to be honest he really like being independent and not followed everywhere. The next morning Troy awoke first by the sun shining in his face. He sat up and looked over at Gabriella who was still sleeping soundly, so therefore, Troy decided to started the fire and it was then Gabriella awoke. \"Good morning,\" Gabriella said her voice hoarse by the cold night air. \"Morning,\" Troy said with his equally hoarse voice making Gabriella smile. \"Have you been awake long?\" she wondered sitting down by the fire warming her hands. \"No, I just woke up and thought I could start the fire,\" he said poking the fire with some wood before putting it on. \"Thank you,\" Gabriella said and got out of her sleeping bag putting on her jacket. \"What time is it?\" she questioned looking at the sun. \"Eight thirty,\" he said looking at his watch and then at his girlfriend. \"How was it?\" she wondered. \"I enjoyed it. It was really fun,\" he told her honestly looking at her wrapped up in the dark blanket from yesterday evening. \"Would you be willing to do it again?\" she asked him leaning in to put some more wood on the fire. \"Defiantly,\" he said with a bright smile looking at their fire that warmed them after the chilly night. On their way home, around lunch time, they decided to stop by the park to talk simply because they had the time. \"I had a lot of fun,\" Troy told her as they sat down on a wooden bench looking at the fountain. \"I\\'m glad. I really enjoyed it too,\" Gabriella giggled leaning her head on his shoulder. \"There is one thing I want to tell you,\" Troy started nervously and Gabriella looked at him surprised. \"Oh?\" she questioned coking her head to the side. \"I haven\\'t been completely honest with you,\" he started. \"What do you mean?\" she asked frowning confused. \"About who I really am,\" he started looking at her. \"I am from Etrea but I\\'m not a regular guy,\" he tried to explained to her. \"What do you mean?\" she asked genuinely confused and Troy sighed softly. \"I\\'m the prince of Etrea and second in line for the throne after my father,\" he explained and Gabriella didn\\'t say anything which worried him. \"Please say something,\" he begged her. \"How could you?\" she asked hurt and he clearly saw tears swimming in her eyes. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he said before being cut off… \"No!\" she started firmly before continuing. \"You lied to me and I trusted you,\" she said now crying. \"Our entire relationship is all based on lies! I\\'m done Troy. Goodbye,\" she said walking away not letting him say anything more. Troy knew he should stop her but he didn\\'t. He should have said something but he didn\\'t. He just let her walk away ending their relationship. I know that was evil of me! Again sorry on the delay and hope you enjoyed this extra-long chapter! What do you thing is happening next? Will there be \"Troyellea\"? Please review and tell me!'][Chapter 6] ['Thank you so much to pumkinking5, Simone and Princessbree15 for reviewing my last chapter! It made my day getting those reviews, and you guys are amazing! Some people said to me that Gabriella over-reacted when Troy told her who he was, but personally, I think that that\\'s how she is. Back in the second movie, they broke up after he blew a couple of dates (and other things) so, personally, I don\\'t think I was that off track. I understand if you disagree with me ;) Anyways I hope you all like this chapter! Sunday November 4 th Gabriella had tears streaming down her cheeks when she walked away from Troy. She knew their relationship was too good to be true. They had dated for almost two months and know each other for almost three and he had lied to her the entire time. Why did she think that a jock would fall for a geek? She swiftly walked home and closed the front door with a small thud. \"Hello Gabriella! How was it?\" Maria asked but stopped once she saw her daughter crying. \"What happened?\" she questioned concerned. \"I don\\'t want to talk about it,\" she said sadly and dismissively before walking upstairs. Maria sighed knowing it was best to let her daughter be alone until she was ready to talk. A couple of hours later Gabriella came downstairs again and went into the kitchen getting something to drink. \"What happened a couple of hours ago?\" Maria asked calmly looking at her daughter. \"Troy has lied to me since the day we met,\" Gabriella explained untwisting the cap on her water bottle. \"What do you mean? What could he possibly lie about?\" Maria asked confused and Gabriella laughed a little looking over at her mother. \"About who he is,\" she said bitterly taking a swallow of her water. \"Gabriella,\" Maria said shocked. Thinking back, it was just yesterday they were head over heels in love and now it sounded like she hated him! \"Tell me what happened,\" Maria asked her daughter and Gabriella sat down at the kitchen counter. \"We stopped by the park on our way home because he told me he wanted to tell me something. We sat down on one of the benches and he told me how he hadn\\'t been completely honest with me, about who he really was,\" Gabriella started explaining to her mother who listened closely. \"He is in fact from Etrea but he is second in line to the throne after his father, making him the prince of Etrea,\" Gabriella told her clearly hurt and a little angry. \"That is quite a shock. I would never have guessed anything like that,\" Maria said astonished. \"Why does it matter? He lied to me,\" Gabriella pointed out looking intensely at her mother. \"And wouldn\\'t you do the same thing if you were in his shoes?\" Maria questioned, trying to talk sense into her daughter. \"Think about it Gabriella,\" Maria said once Gabriella didn\\'t reply. \"How does he have it back in his own country? Everyone knows him and God knows if he has a private life. I\\'m certain that there is a good reason to why he didn\\'t want anyone to know. Maybe all he wanted was to be normal for once,\" Maria said defending him. \"He still lied to me mom,\" Gabriella said walking back to her room not bothering to argue. Maria sighed once she heard Gabriella\\'s bedroom door slam shut. Gabriella sat down on her bed, grabbed her laptop opening it. She had left it on from the day before, and when the screen lit up it was a picture of her and Troy laughing together. She quickly replaced it with a red, East High, Wildcat paw before opened her Facebook. Scrolling through the feed she closed it when nothing interested her, instead she grabbed a book. Troy walked home a couple of minutes after Gabriella had left the park. When walking past her house he didn\\'t give it a second look, knowing she were angry, hurt and upset. When Troy arrived home he looked at the clock and saw that it was too early to call his mother, therefore he unpacked his backpack and started some laundry. By the time he was finished the time back home was eight thirty in the morning so he called his mother. \"Hello Troy,\" his mother\\'s cheerful voice said as she picked up the phone. \"Hi ma,\" he answered trying to sound cheerful as he walked inside the kitchen. \"How was it? Tell me,\" she wondered wanting to know everything about what her son had experienced. \"Great and then not so great,\" he told her honestly, leaning against the counter, and he knew she was frowning. \"Oh. Why? What happened?\" she wondered and Troy clearly heard that she was concerned for him. \"It started as a great time. It was amazing to go camping, sleeping outside under the stars and making smores. Then on the way home, we stopped at the park and I told her the truth. About who I am and that I am second in line for the throne after my father. At first she didn\\'t say anything but afterwards, she was really hurt and upset. Therefore she broke up with me,\" Troy said hurt. As the words left his lips he felt a little tug in his heart. It was something he had never felt before and it only made him realise how much he did, in fact, love Gabriella. \"I am sorry to hear that Troy,\" she said seriously. \"It\\'s fine I sort of expected it. I would be upset too I guess. How are you and dad?\" he wondered changing the theme. \"Great, but we are all missing you. It\\'s quiet without you here,\" she told him smiling. \"I\\'m not that loud mom,\" Troy defended himself as he heard her started laughing. \"It is your presence,\" she assured him and Troy shook his head at her comment. \"I\\'m coming home in a month and a half for Christmas and I\\'m looking forward to seeing all of you again,\" he reminded her smiling to himself. \"You do and we are all very excited,\" she told him smiling to herself. \"I hope you and Gabriella sort everything out,\" Lucille told him after a moment of silence. \"I hope so too ma. I really do,\" he said. \"How is school going?\" she questioned as it had been some time since they last talked about it. \"School is school I guess. I\\'m studying and I think I\\'m doing ok. We have a science test in a couple of weeks that I know I have to study for and then it\\'s finals before the holidays,\" he told his mother. \"That is great. Good luck on everything, and I am being told to say hello from your father and grandparents here,\" she said and chuckled a little. \"Say hi to them from me and that I miss all of you,\" Troy told his mom and smiled to himself. \"I will. I have to go now. I have a meeting with the secretary of the education department before your father\\'s session with the departments,\" Lucille told her son. \"Ok. We will talk later mom?\" \"Of course. Bye Troy,\" she said and they hung up. Monday, November 5 th Gabriella walked alone to school earlier than normal, purposely avoiding Troy, and meet Taylor at her locker. The two girls talked but Gabriella didn\\'t mention anything about her \"argument\" with Troy. Taylor didn\\'t think anything about Gabriella not meeting Troy that morning, as they processed towards their homeroom and Ms Darbus. Once entering the classroom Gabriella didn\\'t give Troy a look, nor did say anything to him, and that was definitely something Taylor found really strange. Taylor stopped Gabriella after class when everyone had left. \"What has happened?\" she demanded looking at her best friend. \"What? Nothing has happened,\" Gabriella said genuinely confused looking at Taylor. \"You and Troy,\" Taylor pointed out. \"Normally you are by his side the second the bell is sounded. Now you aren\\'t even looking at him. What happened?\" she asked raising an eyebrow. \"We fought and we ended our relationship,\" she said simply walking away from Taylor. \"What?!\" Taylor asked in disbelief, and shocked, as Gabriella turned to her again. \"Why?\" she asked a little more calmly. \"That\\'s between Troy and me,\" Gabriella said walking again, towards her locker. As much as she was mad at Troy she respected his secret and it didn\\'t feel right to tell Taylor every detail about their break-up. \"Ok so I won\\'t push you but you seemed so happy before the weekend,\" Taylor exclaimed. \"So what? Life happens,\" Gabriella said dismissively shrugging her shoulders, before taking out her books for the next class. \"I give up,\" Taylor said closing her locker with a thud heading for her next class. The rest of the day went on like this. Even during lunch, they managed to avoid each other. Troy was at the rooftop garden eating and Gabriella at the library studying. \"How long is this going to last?\" Chad asked concerned looking at their friends sitting at the table. \"I have no idea,\" Taylor said looking at the other Wildcats after telling them what Gabriella has said to her earlier. \"How did they even end up like this?\" Chad wondered out loud. \"No clue and Gabriella refuses to talk about it,\" Taylor said stabbing her salad with her fork before taking a bite. \"What should we do? They are both clearly upset,\" Chad stated looking at her girlfriend. \"I think the best is to do nothing Chad. Let them cool off and see what happens over time,\" Taylor said looking at her boyfriend. Gabriella was on her laptop that night when a message suddenly popped up and she read it: \" Hey! I know you\\'re mad but can we sort this out?\" It read from Troy. \" Depends…\" she answered him readjusting her laptop so she could stretch her legs out. She saw him typing before the message popped up. \"I\\'m sorry for lying and I know you\\'re mad but can I tell you why I didn\\'t tell you?\" he questioned. \" Ok\" was her answer as Troy started typing. \" I wanted to live a normal life. As simple as it sounded I never could. In Etrea I could never be alone and I didn\\'t really have any friends… Do you remember what I told you on the second day of school?\" he typed to her. \" Yes,\" she answered straight away clearly remembering. \" All of that was true. I never had any real friends in that school except that one boy I told you about. Whenever I\\'m going outside of the castle I have a bodyguard following me. His name is Ted and I\\'ve known him since I was about two and a half years old,\" Gabriella read and she genuinely felt sorry for Troy now. \" When I was young probably five or so I was so insanely bored so Ted brought his two children to play with me. They were four and three at that time, and they are probably the closest friends –except that one boy- I have back in Etrea now. Please know that everything I have told you is true except that I\\'m really a prince,\" he typed to her and Gabriella felt even more sorry for him. \" I\\'m so sorry Troy. That doesn\\'t sound fun and I\\'m sorry I overreacted. I was mad that you lied to me, but I now understand why you didn\\'t tell me and I respect that,\" she typed back. \" You don\\'t have to be sorry about it. It wasn\\'t anything you could do about it, but I\\'m glad you understand. If you want to – or at least I hoped-, we could get back together eventually,\" he sent and Gabriella felt her heart flutter. She smiled from ear to ear while reading the last message and hurried to type her reply: \"Who says we have to wait?\" \" I love you,\" his fast reply came and both of them unaware how they both were smiling while having the conversation. \" I love you too Troy but I have to do some homework. See you tomorrow?\" she asked biting her lip nervously. \" Will do. Bye Brie,\" he sent plus a kissing emoji \"Bye,\" she typed back with a heart and Troy was logged off. And just like that their relationship was ok again. On Tuesday morning Taylor saw the two of them talking again when they entered the school and she assumed that they had ended their argument. Thinking how strange it was since Gabriella was so reluctant to talk about it yesterday, but she was happy for her friend. Shrugging her shoulders, she closed her locker, headed towards English. The only subject the teens had together that day being English, afterwards they headed in each direction to their next class. Gabriella had chosen law as her class of choice to prepare for college while Troy had chosen sports theory with Chad and most of the other basketball team. During lunch, Gabriella sat in the library doing some schoolwork and Troy sat with the others in the canteen, non-mentioning the breakup in fear of stirring things up in the couple\\'s relationship, and trusting them to share if they wanted to in time. During free period there was basketball practice and a declaration meeting. When Troy headed home that day Gabriella was doing one of her AP classes, which was calculus on Tuesday\\'s. That night the couple was on the phone talking about everything and nothing. \"How are you feeling towards tomorrow\\'s musical practise?\" Troy asked her. \"I don\\'t know. I think I have learned the script and I have been practising with Kelsi. Sharpay also promised me that she would help me run lines tomorrow. Which is also why I have been doing so much homework, so now I\\'m about a week and a half ahead and I\\'ve started studying for the finals,\" she told her boyfriend who just groaned. \"What?\" she asked laughing. \"I just realised that I told my mom everything was going but in reality, I\\'m behind on my English and Spanish, plus I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to fail in science if I don\\'t get a decent grade on the test in two weeks,\" he told her worried. \"I\\'ll help you study, and on your English and Spanish. What do you say about tomorrow after musical practice?\" she questioned. \"You would do that? Thank you so much! Do you want to come over after school?\" he questioned. \"I\\'d love too, but I have to tell my mom,\" she said looking at her clock seeing it creeping closer to midnight. \"No problem Brie,\" he said as the nickname flowed so easily out of him. \"I think I\\'m heading to bed now. Goodnight Troy and I\\'ll see you tomorrow?\" she questioned. \"Most defiantly. Goodnight and sleep well,\" Troy said and they hung up looking forward to spending their next day together. That was it! Whew, these chapters just get way longer than I plan haha! Great for you guys ;) So please tell me what you think! All reviews are greatly appreciated and awarded with a shout-out! Next chapter might be about Christmas. (A little undecided about that) So please tell me if I should wait a little more until I post the Christmas chapter(s) Until next time! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 7] ['Hey everyone! I\\'m so so sorry that this is almost two weeks late! I was mean to update on the 17 th but I haven\\'t had the time to write before now. School was out on 21 st and I was at a friend\\'s house for a sleepover, where I ended up getting a bad sunburn and then I had to take care of a couple of personal things so I haven\\'t had the time to write before now. I hope you all like it and before we start the chapter I want to give a huge shout-out to pumkingking5 for constantly reviewing my chapters! Thank you so much, you are the best! Also, I don\\'t know what was up with the \\'review\\' from Messenger777. Let\\'s just ignore it? Anyways on with the story! Wednesday, November 7 th As their day passed with lessons in science, English, PE and social study, it was finally time for theatre practice. The couple walked down the quiet hallways of East high making their way to the auditorium where it was bussing inside. \"Ah, there you are!\" Ms Darbus rich voice carried out as they walked inside, the door closing with a little thud. \"Right everyone! Today we\\'re going through the first act of Twinkle Town . Miss. Evans will assist me in watching and giving comments on improvement.\" \"I just have to say I\\'m so happy to see all of you and I simply cannot wait to see this fabulous show that Darbus wrote for us,\" Sharpay exclaimed and as usual wearing her pink outfit that could make anyone go blind if they stared too long. \"Kissing up to the teacher much?\" Troy whispered so quietly that only Gabriella could hear him. Gabriella\\'s head turned and glared at him, even though a smile was playing in the corners of her lips. \"Quite right Miss Evans. Places everyone!\" she called and the curtains dropped. A gruelling forty-five minutes later the curtains closed for the final time and Darbus and Sharpay\\'s applause could be heard. \"Splendid! Brava!\" the duo praised the cast members. \"I thought it was bravo?\" Troy questioned and Gabriella hit his shoulder playfully. \"Ouch.\" \"Oh get over it,\" she said to him and shoved him slightly from their sitting position. \"Let\\'s take act one scene six one more time. There are a couple of things that need to be adjusted.\" Darbus could be heard saying and cast members made their way onto the stage. \"Great for us, because we can start studying for the science test,\" she said taking out her thick book from her backpack. \"You really hoped to get some down time during practice didn\\'t you?\" Troy asked looking amused at his girlfriend. \"Not for my part.\" Troy gave her a look raising his eyebrow and she shook her head. \"Didn\\'t you say how behind you were just last night?\" she asked flipping to the start of the chapter they were going to be questioned in. \"Let\\'s take it from the top,\" Gabriella told him as she started asking questions. The couple didn\\'t get much time to read science in between the scene rehearsals, but little was better than nothing. As Darbus called it to an end it was six in the evening and the cast felt like they could the first act forward and backwards in their sleep. \"So when do you have to be home?\" Troy questioned as they walked towards his house. The air around them was surprisingly warm in the early November month, and the sun didn\\'t look like it was going to set for several hours. \"Ten,\" Gabriella answered moving her hand closer to Troy\\'s, who accepted it and their fingers were laced together. \"Great. Then we\\'ll have plenty of time to eat before we start on our homework,\" Troy said as they walked onto their street. The couple made small talk as they got closer and closer towards Troy\\'s house. When they stood at the front door, Troy rummaged into his backpack and pulled out his keys unlocking the door. Opening it for Gabriella they both stepped inside and Troy turned on the lights. As Gabriella looked around while walking inside she was amazed. Stepping into the living room she stopped and looked at a picture in his bookshelf that she hadn\\'t noticed before. Carefully she picked it up studying the small picture in the wooden frame. \"Is there anything special you want for dinner?\" he questioned but she didn\\'t hear it. \"Brie?\" Troy asked looking into the living room. He stopped in the doorframe for a second seeing she had found the picture on his bookshelf. \"Is there anything special you want for dinner?\" Troy questioned again and her head snapped up as he let out a small chuckle. \"I don\\'t care.\" Was her response. \"I didn\\'t notice this picture before,\" she commented and he sighed walking closer. \"That\\'s because it wasn\\'t there last time you were here.\" Gabriella frowned a little before he continued to explain. \"Whenever anyone of you have been over I have hidden the different pictures,\" Troy admitted with a sigh looking at Gabriella, to the picture in her hands, and back up at her. \"I really didn\\'t want anyone of you to know. To be honest I didn\\'t plan on telling anyone until after graduation but I\\'ve learned that I shouldn\\'t wait that long. Then again how do you tell anyone something like this?\" \"I\\'m sure they\\'ll understand. If not, you still have me.\" Gabriella assured him, giving him a little smile. \"Is this your family?\" she asked looking down at the picture. \"Mhm,\" Troy said walking over to stand slightly behind her. \"It was taken May this year for the annual flower blossoming festival.\" Looking down at the picture he saw himself standing in between his parents and grandparents, all five of them smiling. \"That is my mother and father, Lucille and Jack. My grandmother and grandfather are Amelia and Alexander,\" he explained to her as she looked at the five people in the photograph. \"You really look like your father and grandfather,\" she said with a smile. \"It\\'s the eyes,\" he explained to her. \"At least that\\'s what mom says,\" he said with a little laugh. \"Hey, it\\'s true.\" Gabriella defended looking at the picture once more before placing it back into the bookshelf. \"You mentioned food?\" she said hopefully. \"Talking about changing subjects,\" he laughed and they walked into the kitchen. \"and that\\'s how it ends up as a nucleus,\" Troy finished explaining looking at Gabriella for approval. \"Great! I would say you have it covered now.\" \"You sure?\" Troy questioned and Gabriella nodded approvingly closing the book. \"Yes, I\\'m sure. What time is it?\" \"Nine,\" he said after looking down at his watch. \"Not much time to start on the Spanish then,\" Gabriella said with a sigh. \"It is ok. I will manage,\" he told her with a smile. \"I\\'m curious,\" she started, \"Obviously you speak English but not Spanish. Do you know any other languages?\" Gabriella asked curiously. \"All?\" \"All? How many?\" she asked astonished. \"Only six,\" he said with a shrug of his shoulders. \"English, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Arabic and French.\" \"How many of them do you speak fluently?\" she asked raising an eyebrow. \"All six of them,\" he told her with a little smile. \"What? How?\" \"I attended first grade at a public school, which by the way was when I meet my best friend. But after that year mom and dad decided to hire a tutor for me that I had for five years before I started public school again in sixth grade.\" \"So in those five years, you learned all of the six languages?\" \"Not exactly. I learned Arabic, French and Thai from the tutor but Japanese and English I learned at school,\" Troy explained to his curious girlfriend. \"What about Chinese?\" \"Japanese and Chinese isn\\'t that different, so if you speak one of the languages it isn\\'t hard to learn the other.\" \"Does everyone in Etrea speak English and Japanese?\" Gabriella questioned curling her legs under herself. \"Most of them yes. Japanese and English are the two official languages in Etrea, even though English is spoken by the majority of the people.\" Troy explained looking at her. There was a silence between the two teens and Gabriella\\'s gaze landed on another picture of Troy, his mother and another boy who had black hair and appeared to be the same age as Troy. \"Do you miss your family?\" she asked bluntly looking into his light blue orbs. \"I have to admit that I have been a little homesick at times during the past three months, but you and everyone have helped me.\" \"How?\" questioned Gabriella interested in knowing what they had done. \"The camping trip, theatre practice, basketball practice, being with all of you, and the basketball matches,\" Troy explained before continuing; \"even though, at some of those times, I have missed my family more because the things they have missed. Royal or not, they try their hardest to be normal parents attending the things I have been active with.\" Troy said with a little smile as different memories crossed his mind. \"I know it\\'s still weeks away but are you staying her in Albuquerque for the holidays?\" \"No, I\\'m going back to Etrea to celebrate with my family. We have a family tradition to celebrate with the whole family and it will be great to see everyone again. What about you? What are your plans?\" \"Just the usual with me and my mom,\" she said looking down, becoming quiet. \"Hey is everything ok?\" Troy asked a little concerned about her sudden quietness. \"Yeah, I\\'m ok it\\'s just that two weeks ago it was seven years since my father passed. I know it has been so many years but I love him,\" Gabriella said sadly and wiped away a single tear that rolled down her cheek. Troy put a comforting arm around her shoulder and pulled her closer to him kissing her temple. \"I\\'m sorry to hear that,\" Troy told her and Gabriella shrugged her shoulders. \"It\\'s ok Troy you didn\\'t know that…\" Gabriella said but was interrupted when she sneezed. \"Bless you,\" Troy said and Gabriella blinked looking at him. \"Thank you. Hey what is the time?\" she questioned a little panicked for not knowing. \"It\\'s nine forty,\" he said looking at his watch. \"I better get going,\" Gabriella announced getting up from the sofa. Troy helped her gather the books and notes they had been using before placing it in her bag. \"Thanks,\" Gabriella smiled as she closed it, hanging it on her shoulder. \"See you tomorrow?\" Troy asked as they stood in the hallway. \"Yeah, I\\'ll see you tomorrow Brie,\" Troy said and they shared a soft kiss before Gabriella opened the door heading home. Thursday, November 8 th Troy stood waiting for Gabriella by her locked the next morning. As the clock was creeping closer and closer towards 8:20 and still no sign of her, he was starting to grow anxious. \"Why you just standing around here hoops?\" Troy heard Chad say and he turned around facing his friend. \"I\\'m waiting on Gabriella but she hasn\\'t showed up yet,\" Troy told Chad as Chad was standing there with his basketball as usual. \"I\\'m sure she just slept in. It happens to everyone,\" Chad assured him. \"Honey that\\'s just you,\" Taylor said as she passed them in the hallway to reach her own locker. \"Ouch,\" Troy laughed with a little smile. \"But seriously Troy, you don\\'t need to worry. She\\'ll be here, just wait and see,\" Taylor assured him as the warning bell was sounded. The three teens made their way towards geography with Mr Howe, which had to be their least favourite teacher. As the double lesson dragged on there was still no sign of Gabriella, and even Taylor was worried by this. Free period on Thursday meant basketball for the Wildcats, but not before Troy had checked his phone. Troy felt relieved when he saw the text from Gabriella telling him that she had gotten sick and stayed home for the day. At six that evening Troy sat on his computer doing some homework when a Skype call from Gabriella came through. \"Hey, Brie how are you feeling?\" Troy asked as the call connected. \"Not too great. I have a fever and my voice is hoarse.\" \"I can hear that,\" Troy said to her with a little smile. \"I hope I haven\\'t infected you,\" she told him couching a little. \"If you have it is no big deal. By the sound of it you are not coming to school tomorrow either?\" he asked her and she nodded. \"No, I won\\'t. Do you by chance have a copy of the homework?\" Gabriella questioned hopefully. \"I certainly do. I collected extra copies for you since you were a no show. Do you want me to bring you anything from your locker tomorrow?\" \"Yes, please. I need to read myself up to the scholastic decathlon competition,\" she said with a sigh. \"Don\\'t overdo it ok? Just text me the combination and what you need and I\\'ll stop by tomorrow.\" \"Thank you, Troy,\" Gabriella smiled gratefully at him. \"I have to do some homework so I\\'ll see you tomorrow,\" Troy said to her. \"Ok. See you tomorrow.\" Gabriella said and ended the call. Hope you all liked it! I decided against jumping straight to Christmas because it was too much of a gap, but I promise you, within the next two chapters Christmas will be here. Also, I tried out a new writing style. What do you think about that? Reviews are greatly welcomed (but only if they are about the story /writing ;) )'][Chapter 8] ['I\\'m sorry I\\'m late (again…) For the past two weeks I have been working a part time job and when I come home I don\\'t have the energy to write. Three weeks ago I was at a music festival where the last thing on my mind was the story. Now this chapter is extra-long but there is some major time skipping in this. I feel like I have come to the point where I had to do it to get the story moving in the direction I wanted to. I hope you all enjoy it and one last thing is a shoutout to Pumkingking5 for constantly reviewing and my good friend The Princess of Books. Please leave a review telling me what you like/dislike about the story! I love hearing your opinions! And now without further ado: Friday, November 9th Troy\\'s POV I was on my way home as soon as school was out that Friday. My backpack much heavier than normal due to the books and notes Gabriella wanted from her locker. Walking up her driveway I stopped outside the black front door and raised my hand, making a fist, before knocking on the door. Moments later it opened revealing my girlfriend standing in the doorway dressed in a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. I could see that she still had a fever, because of the slight redness in her face. \"Hey Troy.\" \"Hi Brie, are you feeling any better?\" I questioned her and she gave me a little smile. \"I feel a little better. Would you like to come in?\" she offered me and I let a smile cross my face. \"For a little while,\" I accepted, \"You should stay in bed though,\" I told her as we entered the house and she lead the way towards the living room. \"I have been sitting on the couch all day doing nothing. It\\'s great to get up every now and then. Especially when I know I can see you.\" Gabriella let out a little cough and I gave her a look. \"Mhm, sure about that?\" I asked her as she sat back down on the couch. I took the purple blanket that was balled at the end of the couch and wrapped it back around her as she rested back against the couch. \"Did you find everything in my locker?\" she questioned curiously looking at me sitting in the chair at the end of the sofa. I laughed and opened my black backpack that I had put on the floor. \"That was the least of my concerns. Your locker was so organized,\" I told her taking out her books before looking for the notes and papers. \"Well I got a few tips from Taylor and I always hated to have it messy,\" Gabriella explained with a little shrug of her shoulders watching as he took out everything. \"Oh and before I forget it. Darbus was telling the whole homeroom about the musical next month and reminded the cast about the extra schedules that was on her desk.\" I told her and she stretched for the folded piece of paper I presented her. My eyes watched as my girlfriend unfolded the paper, her brown eyes scanning the words on the paper. \"This is a lot of extra practises. We have finals coming up soon that I need to study for, and the scholastic decathlon competition is soon,\" Gabriella complained looking back at me. \"We will manage don\\'t worry. I am sure you will ace every final as you have, just as you have done with every test this semester, and when it comes to the decathlon competition, I have watched your team and you are all unstoppable. I strongly believe that you will win the next couple of competitions and be in the final in March,\" I reassured her and Gabriella took a breath and nodded. \"What about basketball?\" she questioned her voice becoming raspy. \"Don\\'t worry about that too ok? Chad is confident that we are ready for our next games and if I can\\'t be at practise Chad promised me that us guys could meet during the weekends and he would show me.\" I told her confidently. \"I\\'ll just figure this out with Taylor and I think a lot will be sorted,\" she said to me and I nodded. \"See, everything is going to all right. Now I think I should head home and you should get some rest,\" I said and rose from the chair. \"Ok. Hopefully I\\'ll see you on Monday,\" she told me with a smile and I kissed her forehead. \"Get better soon ok?\" I said to her and she smiled back at me. \"Thanks. See you later Troy.\" \"See you later Brie,\" I said to her and left. Tuesday, November 20th It was Tuesday evening and I was studying for the science test tomorrow. To say I was nervous was an understatement! I knew I was in trouble if I didn\\'t get a good grade now. With the help of Gabriella and Taylor I had gotten a C- on my Spanish project and was happy with that for the time being. The Wildcats had a basketball game this Friday which was critical to win if we wanted to qualify for the championship game. If we won, the Wildcats were most likely going to the back to back championship game. This was all crazy! The musical had it\\'s opening night on the 7th of December where we had one show before a new musical was taking place in the spring. My gaze fell on the kitchen clock to see it was a little after midnight. I sighed out loud and pushed the chair back closing the book with a soft thud. What I hadn\\'t learned now I probably won\\'t learn. Besides, it was only six hours until I had to get up again and there was no point in falling asleep during the test. \"That wasn\\'t so bad,\" Taylor stated as we walked out of the classroom after the test. \"I was actually pleasantly surprised about the questions too. Much easier than I anticipated,\" she agreed. \"I don\\'t know what I am going to say,\" I muttered and Chad shook his head as he had heard what I said. \"Oh come on you two. If you just had studied more it would have been easier,\" Taylor told us giving us both a look. \"Geese Taylor. Not everyone has a super brain to remember absolutely everything they read,\" Chad stated pissed before walking off. \"What?\" Taylor questioned hugging her book closer to her body as we walked down the crowded hallway. Exactly a week later I sat in the science room with the same nerves as last time. I was literally under two minutes away of getting my test back. My gaze followed the teacher as she handed out the papers to the students. As I read their expressions it was a mix of everything. Some were overjoyed, other clearly disappointed while a handful of people simply didn\\'t seem to care. Our teacher walked over to my desk and put the white piece of paper face down on my desk. Nervously I reached out for it, picked it up and looked at the red letter in the top right corner. A smile crossed my face and as I peered up from the paper in my hand, I saw Gabriella\\'s smiling gaze landed on me. As the bell was sounded students scrambled to get out of the classroom and I made my way over to Gabriella. \"Hey you,\" I said to her and she turned around picking up her bag. \"Hey how did it go?\" she questioned curiously and I smiled showing her the piece of paper. \"B+!\" she exclaimed quietly as we walked out into the hallway. \"That is amazing Troy. I knew you could do it,\" she said to me confidently. \"I can\\'t take all the credit. You helped me out a lot two weeks ago when we studied together,\" I told her honestly. \"What about you? Are you happy?\" I asked her and she nodded with a smile. \"Very. I got an A+.\" \"That\\'s amazing congratulations,\" I said to her and she smiled. \"Hey have you seen the forecast lately?\" Gabriella questioned me excitedly. \"No?\" I admitted a little confused and she smiled looking at me. \"It\\'s supposed to snow in two weeks,\" she cheered excitedly. \"And?\" I questioned not seeing why she was so excited. \"Albuquerque is so far south that we once in a blue moon get a decent amount of snow here. The forecast said that it is supposed to come 4 inches or more of snow,\" she exclaimed excitedly looking at my face. Puzzled by the meaning of once in a blue moon my expression was thoughtful. \"You don\\'t seem very excited,\" she observed. \"I am but 4 inches isn\\'t that much,\" I said to her and she frowned. \"For a state so south it is a lot. On average it comes one inch maybe,\" she pointed out. \"What is normal in Etrea?\" \"Depends on where you are. In the capital Iwaki, on average there could be anything between 30 to 40 centimetres of snow in December. In inches that is approximately 12 to 16 inches. In the western parts of the country it could get as much as 50 to 60 centimetres which equal 19 to 23 inches,\" I said to her and she looked shocked at me as we entered our English classroom. \"Maybe we\\'ll get a snow day on Friday,\" she said as we sat down in our normal seats. Gabriella was seated beside me, Taylor behind me and Chad on my left. \"Snow day?\" I questioned looking at her. \"Don\\'t tell me you haven\\'t heard about snow days?\" Chad exclaimed shocked looking at me. \"No? We don\\'t have them in Etrea,\" I told Chad who was looking at me wide eyed. \"Dude it is the best days ever invented. We have four snow days and if there comes so much snow that the schools decide to close we get the day off.\" \"Just like that?\" I questioned surprised about the whole concept. \"Yup. No extra work, no extra days we have to be at school unless we use more than those four snow days,\" Chad explained and I was amazed. \"That is a great concept but a little strange that they would close a school due to snow,\" I said to them as the warning bell was sounded. Friday, December 14th When I awoke that Friday morning it was just as any other day, except when I looked outside my bedroom window the snow was falling heavily and there was already a good amount of snow on the ground. I found a thick sweater and after checking the temperature I found one of my warmer jackets in the back of the closet, and it was then I heard my phone. I walked over to the table and saw that I had received a text from Brie. I reckon you haven\\'t heard but we have a snow day today! Chad just texted me asking if we wanted to come over at his place. Usually, that means playing in the snow… Remember gloves! If you\\'re free, meet me at my house at ten? Xoxo Brie . Sending a text back telling her I would meet her at ten I looked over at the clock again. Seeing as it was only seven I had three hours and was suddenly craving some Etrean food. I looked inside the pantry and figured out I had the ingredients to make Natto. I got the rice, soybeans, soy sauce and what was left of the dried bonito. After what I remembered I didn\\'t have any seasoned seaweed but that didn\\'t matter at the time. I found some green onions and some mustard in the refrigerator and started making the breakfast. \"Hey Brie,\" I said as she opened the door. \"Hey are you ready?\" she questioned and I nodded. We were both dressed about the same in warm jackets, gloves and a beanie. Gabriella was also wearing a blue coloured scarf that she had wrapped around her neck. \"Bye mom see you later,\" Gabriella called and we were on our way over to Chad\\'s house. \"So what do you guys normally do over at Chad\\'s house?\" I questioned inherently. \"Depending on the amount of snow I am thinking that he has planned some sled driving, snowball fights. Just typical snow day activities,\" Gabriella said. \"Well I don\\'t know much about snow day activities so I\\'m looking forward to this,\" I exclaimed excitedly. \"The thing I\\'m looking forward to is coming inside and warming myself up again. It\\'s freezing outside,\" she concluded. As we came over to Chad\\'s house Taylor, Zeke, Jason, Ryan and Kelsi was already there waiting for us all bundled up in their winter jackets and coats. \"What have you planned today?\" Taylor asked Chad as she was moving around to keep the cold out. \"Sled driving,\" he said excitingly with a grin plastered on his face. Chad found a couple of mats and other stuff before leading us towards a partially remote place no more than a minute of walking. \"Here it\\'s perfect because there hardly is any cars driving her, and this hill is awesome!\" he exclaimed as we looked down. \"Ladies first?\" he asked and handed a mat over to a rather sceptical Gabriella. \"I\\'m not so sure,\" Gabriella said sceptically gazing down at the mat, down the hill and then back at Chad. \"I can go with you,\" I said to her when I saw how uncomfortable she was. \"Ok,\" she agreed a little reluctantly but took the mat from Chad\\'s outstretched hand. Putting the mat down on the snow cowered ground I sat down taking the small rope that was attached at the front holding on. Gabriella sat down behind me and took a hold around my torso. \"Don\\'t push Chad,\" Gabriella warned and I knew she was looking at him. \"Are you ready?\" I questioned her as I could feel her gripping around me a little tighter. \"Let\\'s do it,\" she said determined and I could feel us starting to go forwards. \"Chad!\" she squealed as I felt a push and downhill it went. The only sound I could hear was Gabriella\\'s slight screaming and the whooshing of the air as it passed us. The speed only seemed to increase and me having no clue how to steer, stop or even slow this thing down, we somewhat ended up going sideways. \"Oh no,\" Gabriella exclaimed before we tumbled over and landed on the soft white ground. When I sat up I was covered in snow and I just sat there laughing looking back up at the group looking from the hills. \"That was fun,\" I stated excitedly and Gabriella huffed brushing some snow out of her hair. \"You ever done this before?\" she questioned as I shook my head, no. We eventually made our way back up the hill where everyone was waiting on us. We had just reached the top as the next couple of persons went down again, and this was how it continued for several hours. When the clock crept towards four we had made a bunch of snow men, snow angels and we were currently in the midst of a snowball fight. It had started as Chad hit Taylor on the shoulder, but when she was returning fire she had hit Gabriella instead. The result? A full blown snowball fight between me, Taylor, Gabriella and Zeke against Chad Kelsi, Jason and Ryan. \"Yes!\" I cheered as Chad was hit in his afro. The wind picked up around us and snow was being blown everywhere making the visibility bad. \"I\\'m going to get you!\" Chad called making a snowball to throw at his best friend. \"Oh no,\" I muttered running off, away from Chad. Before I even noticed it myself, my feet got lost from underneath of me and the cold snow was in my face. \"Troy!\" I heard Gabriella call as I pushed myself off from the ground. \"Are you ok?\" she questioned worriedly as I brushed myself off. \"I\\'m good,\" I assured her sitting on the ground as the rest came rushing over. \"Are you ok?\" they all questioned worriedly. \"I\\'m good. I think I just slipped on some ice,\" I said to the others as Chad offered his hand to help me up from the ground. \"I think we should call it a day. I\\'m cold and we should stop before anyone seriously injure themselves,\" Kelsi stated wisely looking at all of us. \"Yeah,\" we all muttered agreeing walking towards Chad\\'s house. We said goodbye one after one as our ways separated. In the end it was just me and Gabriella walking the quiet streets of Albuquerque. \"You want to stay at my place for a while?\" \"That is if you don\\'t want to go home and change,\" she added looking up at me while pushing a stray of hair away. \"I\\'m relatively dry so I\\'d love to,\" I told her with a smile and put my right hand around her waist. Naturally she leaned herself into my embrace as we walked home. We walking into the hallway of Gabriella\\'s house and Maria popped her head from the kitchen when the front door closed. \"Gabi is that you?\" Maria asked rounding the corner. \"Yes, also Troy is here,\" she called seeing her mother. \"Hi Maria,\" I greeted with a smile hanging up my jacket. \"Hello Troy. How was your day?\" she asked us. \"Great,\" I smiled. \"Goodness gracious it\\'s freezing outside,\" she stated looking at the thermostat situated in the window still. \"I will make you two some hot cocoa if you want?\" Maria questioned and we both nodded our heads. \"Yes please,\" Gabriella said as she was removing her scarf. \"So what have you all been doing this snow day?\" she questioned as we joined her in the kitchen. \"Enjoying the snow. Chad took us up to that hill again where we were sledge driving. We ended the day with a snowball fight.\" Gabriella told her mother. Maria placed the two steaming cups in front of us and I picked up the mug, taking a small sip that warmed me from the inside. A phone was heard in the distance and Maria excused herself before walking into the living room to answer the call. \"I need to get something from work. Apparently something urgent and what not… Will you two be ok?\" she questioned as she stood in the doorway of the kitchen already dressed in her coat. \"Of course,\" Gabriella stated easily holding around the hot cup. \"See you two later,\" Maria said and walked out the door. \"So what do you think of your first snow day?\" Brie questioned and I let a smile cross my face. \"Exciting,\" I stated at once taking a swallow of the hot drink in my hands. \"So what do you do when you get snow in Etrea?\" she questioned curiously putting the cup down on the table. \"Well I\\'m mostly alone when it\\'s snow. Mom has some siblings that are my age that visit during Christmas and we have a snowball fight outside. It doesn\\'t last long as it isn\\'t fun playing two against one,\" I explained to her and she nodded interested. \"Can you tell me more about Etrea?\" she questioned and I thought for a moment. \"The weather is different,\" I stated and she cocked her head. \"Oh. How come?\" \"Because of the location it gets freezing in the winter and miserably hot in the summer. One more significant difference is school uniforms.\" \"How long do they wear school uniforms?\" she questioned curiously looking at me. \"From the age of six when we start school, until we graduate after college,\" I said taking out my phone. I opened the gallery and started scrolling for a picture. I found the right picture and looked at it for a second before showing it to her. It was a picture of me and Marcus both dressed in school uniforms complete with a blazer and tie. \"He really looks like the boy from a photo at your house. Who is it?\" she questioned giving me my phone back. \"His name is Marcus and we have been best friends since first grade,\" I explained to her. \"He had to move because of his mother\\'s work two years ago so that was partially the reason why I wanted to study abroad,\" I told her and she looked at me. \"What other reasons was there besides wanting to live a normal life?\" she asked me and I looked at her. \"After Marcus moved away I spent most of the last semester alone. Towards the end of the semester I played basketball with a couple of exchange students from Japan and that was when I decided I wanted to take a year abroad,\" I said to her recalling everything. \"I\\'m sorry to hear about Marcus,\" she said to me and I could genuinely hear an apology in her voice. \"Don\\'t be sorry. It was nothing anyone of us could have changed about it.\" I explained to her. Gabriella leaned her head on my shoulder and I put and arm around her. \"I love you Troy,\" she stated looking up at me. \"I love you too,\" I told her kissing her forehead. Gabriella found my left hand and gently squeezed it. A numbing pain shoot through me, nothing like I have ever experienced before. I pulled my hand out of Gabriella\\'s small palm and she looked at me a little worried. \"What\\'s wrong?\" she asked me concerned not shifting her gaze from my eyes. \"My hand hurt,\" I told her and it wasn\\'t before then that she tore her eyes away from me looking down at my hand. \"Let me see,\" she asked and I put my hand in her outstretched one. Looking down at my left wrist it was swollen and had a mix of purple and red colour. \"That doesn\\'t look good,\" she stated concerned. \"I think I should have my mom look at that when she comes home.\" \"I think it might have happened when I fell during the snowball fight,\" I supplied and she nodded agreeing. What do you guys think? What has happened to Troy\\'s wrist? I promise you all that we are moving fast towards Christmas and I have made up my mind about how that is going to unfold. I\\'m not revealing much (or anything for that matter: D ) please stay tuned for more. I am working one more week and then I have two weeks off before school starts on the 17th. I\\'m aiming on writing a couple of chapters in those two weeks so I have ready for you. Until next time -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 9] ['Hello everyone! Here is the next chapter and I would like to do a shout-out to Pumkingking5 for reviewing every single chapter! Thank you so much! Now another thing, I see how many people that are actually reading this and I am a little surprised that there are a couple of hundred people reading but only Pumkingking5 that are leaving a review. So please, I would love to read what you are thinking about the story. In fact, I want to give you a little challenge, -fell free to leave a review just as a guest- 1) What do you like best about the story so far? 2) What do you dislike the most about the story? 3) If there was something you wish I had done different –or something you wish I would do- what would it be? Maybe why too? I would love if some of you took two minutes and answered these questions or just wrote something else. Plus, because I think you all are awesome this chapter is over twice as long as normal! Until next time! -FreeFlyingWriter Friday, December 14 th As Maria stepped inside the house a couple of hours later it was rather quiet. Walking into the kitchen she saw two mugs sitting in the sink, along with a couple of plates and cutlery, and she put the folder of paper on the countertop. Now hearing two voices talking quietly she followed the quiet sound and found the two teens sitting on the sofa. \"I\\'m back,\" she announced and Gabriella looked up at her mother. \"Mom can you take a look at Troy\\'s hand? I think he injured himself during the snowball fight,\" Gabriella started explaining and Maria raised an eyebrow. \"Oh?\" she questioned walking closer. \"It\\'s swollen and looks bruised,\" Gabriella added as Maria carefully looked at his wrist. \"Hm.\" Maria frowned. \"I think we should go to the hospital to get that looked at. It doesn\\'t look good,\" Maria concluded and the two teens nodded. 6:57 PM The three people sat in the quiet waiting room of the hospital twenty minutes later. Despite it being early Friday evening the waiting room was almost empty. \"Troy Bolton?\" a doctor called and Troy along with Gabriella and Maria stood up following the doctor. The doctor lead them into a room where Troy sat down on the bed and the doctor introduced himself. \"So what seems to be the problem?\" the doctor questioned. \"I was at the park having a snowball fight with some of my friends and I fell on some ice and now my wrist is swollen and bruised,\" Troy told showing his wrist to the doctor. \"I see.\" He observed carefully examining it. \"When you fell, did you fall on top of your wrist?\" he wondered. \"Yes,\" Troy answered immediately and the doctor nodded. \"I think we need an x-ray and take it from there.\" Dr. Ramirez said and wrote down something on a piece of paper. \"I will get you once they have an opening,\" he continued and walked out. 8:45 PM Dr. Ramirez returned an hour later with the results of the x-ray pictures. \"So I have taken a look at your x-rays and by the looks of it you have broken your wrist, which explains the swelling, discolouring, pain and bruising. Now the bone here,\" Dr. Ramirez explained showing with a pen on Troy\\'s arm. \"is the biggest of the two bones which is the one you have broken. In order for it to heal we need to surgically insert a steel plate that will be fasten to the bone,\" he said. \"Now what we would like to do is admit you to the hospital and to the surgery tomorrow morning. Do you have any questions?\" Dr. Ramirez asked but Troy shook his head 9:30PM \"Maybe you should call your mom Troy,\" Gabriella said suddenly remembering that they didn\\'t know what was happening. Troy had been admitted to the hospital and was now laying in a hospital bed dressed in a gown with an IV in his right hand. Maria had left a couple of minutes earlier, heading to the cafeteria to get some coffee. \"Yeah. It\\'s only one thirty there,\" he said after thinking for a minute. \"Can you give me my phone? It\\'s in my hoodie,\" he asked Gabriella who nodded and gave it to him. Troy unlocked his phone and found his mother\\'s number calling it. Troy\\'s POV \"Hello Troy,\" mom answering cheerfully. \"Hey mom,\" I started not revealing how nervous I was. \"How are you?\" she wondered. \"Good good,\" I told her looking at Gabriella. She gave me a look and I sighed. \"Um, listen mom. I\\'m at the hospital,\" I told her but she cut me off. \"What? What happened?\" she asked worried. \"We had a day off from school because it has been snowing so much and we all spent the day outside. We ended by having a snowball fight and I fell on top of my wrist, which resulted in me breaking it. I went with Gabriella home afterwards and she and Maria brought me to the hospital about two hours ago,\" I said. \"What did you injure? Are you seriously injured?\" she asked worried. \"No I\\'m not seriously injured. I just broke my wrist when I fell earlier,\" I explained trying to calm her. \"So what is happening next?\" Lucille wondered and I heard she was sceptical. \"They have admitted me and they are going to perform the surgery tomorrow morning. For you it will happen during the night and they are going to put in a metal plate so the bone will grow,\" I tried to explain to her. \"Is Gabriella still with you?\" \"Yes. I think she will stay for as long as she can and probably come up tomorrow if she can. Maria, her mother, is also here,\" I told her. \"Promise me you will call when you are done ok? No matter the time\" mom told me sternly. \"I promise mom,\" I vowed. \"You know I could fly in there if you want me to,\" she said to me and I smiled. \"No you don\\'t need to. I\\'ll be home in a week anyways,\" I said to her and she laughed a little \"I guess you\\'re right. We all love you Troy,\" she told me. \"I love you all too. Bye mom.\" \"Bye Troy,\" Lucille said ending the call. \"How did she take it?\" Gabriella wondered after listening to our conversation. \"Good I think. She was worried though. I promised to call her after the surgery tomorrow and she asked if she should come but there really is no point since I\\'m going home in a week,\" I told my girlfriend. \"I\\'m worried about you too,\" she stated sitting on the edge of the bed beside me. She took my right hand and stroke it softly with her smooth fingers. \"It\\'s going to be ok all right? They will do the surgery, put a cast on and everything will be fine after that,\" I tried to reassure her. \"I\\'m worried about you because I love you,\" she stated. \"I love you too and I\\'m not planning on going anywhere soon,\" I told her. \"Oh Troy,\" she murmured placing a soft kiss on my lip. Just in that moment Maria walked inside the room holding a coffee cup. Maria looked at us and smiled. I broke away from the kiss and Maria sat down in the other chair in the room. \"How are you Troy?\" Maria asked me bringing the styrofoam cup to her lips taking a sip of the coffee. \"Good I think,\" I said a little awkward after being caught by Maria. \"I called my mom a couple of minutes ago so they know,\" I told her. \"Good,\" she nodded. A knock was heard before the door opened and a doctor came inside. \"Hello, I\\'m doctor Alexander Turner,\" he introduced himself. \"Who do you brought with you?\" Dr. Turner asked. \"My girlfriend Gabriella and her mother,\" I said and Dr. Turner shook hands with Maria. \"Will any of your parents come?\" he asked me but I shook my head. \"No, my parents don\\'t live in America and I\\'m here on an exchange year,\" I explained to the doctor. \"I see,\" he said nodding. \"So as you know you need to fix your hand surgically for it to heal. Did they tell you much down in the ER?\" he wondered. \"The basic I think. That there will be a metal plate screwed into place so the bone can heal,\" I said to him and he nodded. \"That is right. I have scheduled the surgery for 8 tomorrow morning so they will begin to prep you at around six in the morning. Do anyone of you have any questions?\" he asked us all but none of us said anything. \"I have never broken a bone before so how will it be for the next couple of weeks?\" I asked looking at the doctor. \"Your hand will be in a cast, and depending on how the operation turns out, and after what I have seen your cast will go from your fingers almost up to your elbows. You will have the cast on for anything between six to eight weeks but we\\'ll get back to that,\" he explained while showing on my arm. \"You can do all the things you normally do but within those six to eight weeks you cannot participate in sports, get the cast wet and you need to be a little careful with your arm so the cast don\\'t crack,\" Dr. Turner \"Is there anything else?\" he asked looking at the three of us. \"No I can\\'t think of anything,\" I said to the doctor and Maria didn\\'t say anything either. \"Great. I will see you in the morning,\" he said and walked out the door. \"You probably want to go home soon?\" I asked Gabriella looking at her. \"Not really,\" she said looking at me. \"You should. Go home and get some sleep and hopefully I will see you after surgery tomorrow,\" I said to her. \"He\\'s right Gabriella,\" Maria agreed nodding. \"What time is it anyways?\" she questioned looking down at her phone. \"Almost eleven,\" Maria said looking at her watch. \"I will see you tomorrow after the surgery?\" Brie questioned and I nodded. \"Defiantly,\" I said to her. \"Good luck,\" she said and gave me a hug before kissing my cheek. Before Gabriella walked out she turned and waved before closing the door behind her. I looked around the small empty hospital room and felt lonely. I used my right hand to pick up my phone that was on the nightstand beside the bed. I got onto Facebook and saw that Marcus was online. Troy: Hey how are you? Marcus: Great why do you ask? Troy: I had a blast today xD I wrote sending him a picture of the and IV in my arm. Marcus: What do you mean? he typed while the picture was being sent. Damn! How did you manage that dude? he questioned once he had seen the picture. Troy: Snowball fight with some friends and fell on ice under the snow. Marcus: Ted couldn\\'t keep you out of trouble this time? Hahaha! Troy: Really funny Marcus but no. He is about 6000 miles away along with my family . Marcus: Where the heck are you?! came faster than the speed of light. Troy: New Mexico in America. Did you forget? I told you last summer. I reminded him. Marcus: That\\'s true. Now I remember! And they let you go alone? Troy: Yeah? Marcus: Nothing… BTW, how is everything going over there? Troy: Besides the arm breaking? xD Great! The school is awesome and no-one wear school uniform. They are just as polite to the teachers as we are. I have been camping for the first time and a couple of movie dates. I cannot believe we have gone this long without talking. Marcus: I know! It is crazy. Wait hold on! Did you say movie date? You are seeing someone and I only now hear about it? Tell me! Does she know? Troy: We meet on the first day of school and she was asked to show me around. She introduced me to a couple of her friends who almost everyone happened to be on the basketball team, and I became friends with them and joined the basketball team. Her name is Gabriella and I asked her out in the middle of September. I told her who I was after we had been camping in early November and we broke up only to get back together about two days later, and we have been together since. I wrote to him. It took a couple of minutes before he answered as he was reading. Marcus: That is an interesting story dude. Is she with you now? Do you have a picture? Troy: No she\\'s not here now. She and her mother brought me here around seven and left twenty minutes ago. Give me a second and I can send you a picture . I wrote and opened the photos on my phone. I found a photo taken not too long ago. All six of us was there. Chad, Taylor, Sharpay, Ryan, Brie and me. Chad was on the right side and had his hand on Taylors shoulder. Brie had both of her hands resting on my right shoulder and both of them were smiling. Sharpay stood beside me and Ryan had set on the timer of the camera so he popped up behind me and Sharpay. Ryan had sent it to all of us in colours and black and white. My favourite was the one in black and white, so I sent it to Marcus. Troy: The girl with her hands on my shoulder is Gabriella. The other girl beside Gabriella is Taylor. Chad is beside her and we play basketball together on the team. On my other side is Sharpay and her brother Ryan. Both of them love the drama department at school and have been in every single musical. Marcus: An interesting mix that is for sure. Do you have any plans on going home before the summer? he questioned. Troy: Yeah. I\\'m coming home for Christmas. It\\'s a shame we can\\'t meet. I miss spending time with you Marcus: I know what you mean. You remember when we were six and put the tape under your grand-father\\'s computer mouse. No one could figure out why it didn\\'t work and were laughing all night about it. he wrote and I started laughing. Troy: It was also the same night we built a huge fort in the dining room. I reminded him Marcus: How could I forget!? They were quit shocked when they saw us the next morning! Troy: How is Ueta? Marcus: Sort of boring. I like Iwaki much more. It is warmer there. Here it has been minus degrees since October and it should be above zero in late March. That was what happened last year . Troy: How is school over there then? Better than before? Marcus: Not the best school. It is really different from all the schools we have attended. The uniform policy is loos and we are still wearing just sweaters. What I am really looking forward to is college next year. I know I am qualified to RCE and I know for a fact that you are too. You are going to RCE right? Troy: Yeah I am. How about we save ourselves a lot of trouble and share a dorm? Marcus: Done! Anyways, what time is it over there? Troy: Midnight. What about it? Marcus: When is the operation? Troy: Eight in the morning. I think I need to call it a night and get some sleep. Talk to you later? Marcus: Yes! Tell me how it went and good luck! Troy: Thanks! I closed Facebook and put my phone back on the nightstand. Before I knew it, I was fast asleep. When I woke up again I looked at the clock and saw it was five forty. With it only being twenty or so minutes left until someone came, I saw it pointless to try and get back to sleep. I closed my eyes but only for a second as a knock was on the door before it opened. \"Good morning my name is Caroline. How are you feeling?\" she asked her voice was soft and caring. \"I\\'m feeling ok. I am nervous though,\" I admitted to the young woman. \"There is no need to be nervous ok? I am going to be there the whole time making sure everything is going smoothly.\" She reassured me and started doing some stuff. \"Now I heard from Dr. Turner that you\\'re from abroad. Where are you from love?\" Caroline asked. \"Etrea,\" I said to her and she looked a little surprised. \"That\\'s a long way from home,\" she smiled and I laughed. \"I suppose it is,\" I said smiling a little too. \"Well, as all adult things in life there are paperwork,\" she said giving me a paper. \"The doctors need you to sign this. It is that you have been warned about the risks of the operation,\" she told me. \"I don\\'t know how much of a choice I have,\" I smiled and she shook her head smiling. \"Thank you,\" she said as I handed her the signed form. \"OK now I am going to remove the drip because you can\\'t have any fluids two hours prior to surgery. It has been more than six hours since you last ate so you are good to go,\" Caroline told me. \"I am going to wheel you down to the post operation and you\\'ll wait there until the doctor talk to you one last time before the operation. Is there anyone specific you want us to contact in case of an emergency?\" Caroline asked taking out a pen and small notepad. \"Preferably someone living close by or my parents?\" I questioned uncertainly. \"Preferably somebody living close and knowing how to eventually contact your parents,\" she confirmed. \"Gabriella Montez. She\\'s my girlfriend,\" I told Caroline without hesitation. \"Great. That should be it.\" she said releasing the breaks before wheeling me out of the room and down several hallways. After a minute or so she turned right and through a set of double doors before she rolled it behind some curtains. \"There,\" she said putting on the breaks. \"Now the doctor will come and speak to you soon and he will explain things more thoroughly with you,\" Caroline told me. \"Thanks,\" I said giving her a little smile. I was approximately half an hour after Caroline had left that Dr. Turner made an entrance and stood at the end of the bed. \"Good morning,\" he greeted me with a smile. \"Good morning,\" I replied with a little smile. \"Ok so what is going to happen next is…\" Dr. Turner started and explained to me everything that was going to happen. \"Do you have any last minute questions?\" he finished and looked at me. \"No I think you have explained everything,\" I said to him thinking if there should be any un-answered questions. \"Good then we\\'ll see each other in the operating room.\" Dr. Turner finished with a smile and walked away. Caroline and another nurse was wheeling me down towards the operating room just as the clock had turned 7:55. \"Here we are,\" Caroline said as we stopped inside the room. \"Now if you could hop onto the table here,\" she asked and I got onto the table. \"We\\'re going to take good care of you,\" Caroline assured me as the other nurse left. It was then I fully noticed how many people were in the room. Caroline must have seen my expression because she smiled at me and asked: \"Tell me how did you manage to break your arm?\" \"I had a snowball fight with my friends and I fell.\" \"Oh dear. The snow can be dangerous,\" she told me and chuckled. \"I have to put this on now since they are un-packing the equipment,\" she told me putting on her face mask. An elderly man walked up to us and he had short white curly hair, green eyes and glasses. \"Ok Troy here is the anaesthesiologist,\" Caroline informed me, and despite him wearing a mask I could see him smile. \"Are you ready to sleep for a couple of hours?\" he asked me and I nodded. \"Ok now I\\'ll place this mask on you and you\\'ll get sleepier and sleepier,\" he informed me and put the mask that covered my nose and mouth. \"Starting the anaesthesia now,\" he said pressing a button and the gas coming from the mask smelled a little funny. I could feel my eyelids getting heavier and heavier. \"Don\\'t fight it,\" Caroline said and with that I was asleep. My eyes felt heavy and everything was groggy. \"Troy,\" I heard a distant voice say. \"Troy you need to wake up now,\" the same voice said again. I slowly managed to open my eyes and it was then I was aware that I had a tube down my throat. \"Are you awake?\" Dr. Turner asked and I nodded slightly. \"Let me get this tube out. Just open your mouth,\" he said and I did as instructed. \"Good now we\\'re going to take you to the post op where they will observe you for a couple of hours,\" Dr. Turner told me. \"Ok,\" I managed to say. I was extremely tired and all I really wanted to do was sleep. In the daze I was in I registered that they wheeled me down the most of the same way as they had earlier. I felt my arm was different than before. My left arm was rested on top of my chest in some sort of sling but it was all covered by a blanket. They stopped and wheeled me into the post-op hooking me up to different machines also attaching a drip to my IV. The beeps of the heart rate machine were enough to lull me to sleep. When I woke up again I was back in a normal room and someone was holding my right hand. \"Hey,\" Gabriella said when she saw me awake. \"Hi,\" I told her a little drowsily. \"How are you?\" she asked me studying my face. \"Good,\" I told her giving her a tired smile. \"Did the doctor tell you anything?\" I questioned not taking my eyes off her. \"He didn\\'t say much other than that the operation was a success. They have applied a cast but they need to change soon because your wrist is so swollen,\" she said to me. \"Good,\" I said and Gabriella gave me a sympathetic smile. \"What time is it?\" I asked her and she looked down at her watch. \"A little after ten. What about it?\" she asked looking at me a little puzzled. \"I promised I would text my mom when I was finished,\" I said to her and she gave me my phone. I tried to text her but it was difficult since I was still a little out of it. \"Do you need help?\" Gabriella asked as she had seen me struggle. \"Yes please,\" I said giving her the phone. \"Can you just type that the operation was a success, I am doing fine just really tired,\" I said and she typed. \"There. Do I just send it?\" she questioned and I nodded. She put the phone on the table beside me and took my hand again and my eyes closed. \"You\\'re tired Wildcat,\" she stated and I opened my eyes to see her looking at me smiling. \"Yeah. I\\'m still a little groggy,\" I told her. \"Just rest and sleep it off,\" she told me stroking her hand through my hair. When I woke up again Gabriella was talking to someone on the phone. \"We\\'ll be back at school on Monday,\" she said before pausing. \"No he\\'s asleep now,\" a pause again. \"You can talk to him later Chad. Everything is fine I promise,\" \"Ok bye,\" she said hanging up. \"Hi,\" she said looking at me. \"Was that Chad on the phone?\" I asked her and she nodded. \"Yeah. I called him because he didn\\'t knew you broke your hand. I figured he would like to know,\" she explained to me. \"How long was I asleep?\" \"Only half an hour,\" she told me sitting in the chair beside my bed. \"Are you in any pain?\" she asked me suddenly looking at my arm. \"No. I think they gave me painkillers,\" I said gesturing to the IV in my right arm. A knock was heard and Dr. Turner came inside. \"Hello Troy. How are you feeling?\" he asked me with a smile. \"Good. My wrist doesn\\'t hurt now,\" I told the doctor. \"Great. I wanted to have a look and see if we could replace the cast and hopefully discharge you in a couple of hours,\" he informed me. \"Sounds great,\" I said and Dr. Turner examined my wrist carefully. \"The swelling is almost gone so I think we could put on a new cast,\" Dr. Turner said. A couple of hours later Maria was driving me home. \"Thank you for taking me to the hospital yesterday Maria,\" I told her sincerely. \"No problem Troy. I\\'m just glad you\\'re better now,\" Maria said with a smile and stopped outside of my house. \"I will see you tomorrow?\" I asked Gabriella and she nodded. \"Yeah,\" she said with a smile. \"Bye. I know a little boring at the end but in the next chapter, Christmas will come around yay! A little spoiler: Maria has a surprise for Gabriella and I dub out she will like it...'][Chapter 10] ['All right everyone, here is the next chapter. I didn\\'t get the response I hoped for in the last chapter, but a massive shout out to Pumkingking5 for reviewing! You make my day every time you review and I really appreciate it! Now onto the chapter and I hope you all like it! December 16 th Troy\\'s POV The well-known Skype ringtone was sounded from my computer and I accepted the video call coming through. \"Hi Troy,\" mom said as she saw me. It was eight o\\'clock Sunday evening here which meant that it was twelve on Monday back home. \"Hi everyone,\" I said seeing as both of my parents and grandparents was there. \"How are you son?\" dad asked for everyone. \"I am good,\" I told all of them. \"We were all so worried about you. How did you manage to break your arm?\" my grandmother Amelia asked. \"On Friday it started snowing during the night, and because Albuquerque rarely get much snow they closed the school and we got a snow day. Chad from the basketball team invited a bunch of us to his house and we spent the day outside playing in the snow. We finished with a snowball-fight and I fell on top of my arm and that\\'s how I broke it,\" I told them with a little smile. \"I imagine your arm is in a cast,\" my grandfather Alexander said. The doctor had told me to keep my wrist elevated for the next forty-eight hours and when I got dressed this morning I put on a black hoodie over my arm so it was hidden underneath. \"Yeah it is. I was told to keep it elevated until tomorrow morning,\" I informed all of them. \"How has the year been so far?\" my grandmother wondered with a little smile. \"Wonderful. School is ok, our homeroom teacher loves drama and are constantly hoping for the whole class to participate in the school\\'s musical. The basketball team have won the last couple of games so we are hoping to get qualified for the championship game in April,\" I told them. \"What about your friends?\" mom asked me and I smiled even more. \"They\\'re great. We\\'re all busy about the last couple of finals, the musical, basketball and Taylor and Gabriella have been working really hard about the scholastic decathlon competition. They made it through the first rounds and have a great shot at ending up in the finals,\" I told them. \"Do you know what Gabriella are doing during the holidays?\" grandma wondered. \"No, we haven\\'t talked about that. I guess she will celebrate with her mother,\" I told them. \"Speaking of Christmas, are you still coming home?\" mom asked and I nodded. \"Of course. I would not miss Christmas with all of you,\" I told them. \"People here still don\\'t know where you have been so we thing it would be safest if Ted came and picked you up before you travelled back to Etrea,\" dad told me. \"I thought it would end up like that. Still flying to Los Angeles and from there to Iwaki?\" I questioned and dad nodded. \"The security thought that it would be the safest for everyone.\" We continued to talk for a good hour before we ended it and I headed to bed. Monday, December 16 th 3 rd POV \"Good morning,\" Troy smiled as he greeted his girlfriend that Monday morning. \"Hey Troy,\" Gabriella said closing her locker, turning towards her boyfriend. \"Looking forward to Christmas?\" he asked her and she smiled. \"Yes,\" she exclaimed and Troy laughed. \"How do you celebrate it?\" Troy wondered with a little frown as they started making their way towards class. \"It\\'s just me and my mom. We go to church to remember my father before going home and we eat Mexican and American Christmas food. We usually watch a Christmas movie before going to bed, and the next morning we open presents,\" she explained. \"That sounds amazing,\" Troy smiled. \"Is it really different for how you celebrate?\" Gabriella questioned and Troy gave a little smile. \"Not terribly,\" he answered. \"My grand-parents invite everyone in the family to celebrate at the castle. Mom has two siblings so with my mother\\'s parents, her siblings, their family and my family we are sixteen,\" Troy told her with a smile. \"That\\'s a crowd,\" Gabriella said a little shocked. \"Is there some ceremonial stuff you\\'re supposed to do? What do you do?\" she asked him quietly so they wouldn\\'t get heard by others in the hallway. \"We too go to church the day before Christmas eve, but it mostly ceremonial. Afterwards we are closing the trading market for Christmas and such. Then on the 24th there is a Christmas parade during the day before we eat dinner all as a family in the evening and my grandfather does a speech on the TV. Then it is different from year to year. Last year mom and I made cookies while some of the others played, but another year we watched a movie. It\\'s different but we do it together,\" he said. \"It sounds like a normal family. It\\'s hard to think who they really are,\" she said thoughtfully. \"To me they are just mom and dad,\" he pointed out. \"True. Hey, how is your wrist?\" she asked looking at his red cast. \"It\\'s better. Doesn\\'t hurt but I can thank the painkillers for that,\" he laughed. \"Oh Troy,\" she said and smiled as they walked into their class. Later that night Troy was in the phone with his mother. \"We know that this is a little short notice but we would all love to meet Gabriella. Why don\\'t you invite her and Maria to spend Christmas with us? Or if she wants to come after Christmas eve and spend the new year with us,\" Lucille proposed to her son. \"I don\\'t know, I will ask her though,\" Troy told his mother uncertainly. \"Ok, goodnight Troy,\" Lucille said softly. \"Goodnight mom,\" Troy said ending the call. He hadn\\'t more than put down his phone when it rang again. \"Hey Brie,\" he said cheerfully when he saw the caller ID. \"Are you busy?\" she sniffed and Troy grew concerned. \"No what\\'s wrong?\" he asked concerned. \"Are you here for Christmas?\" she asked ignoring his question. \"No. I thought I told you I\\'m going home,\" he said frowning a little. There was silence. \"What is wrong?\" he asked softly. \"Mom… she just told me she was called to a meeting…\" there was a pause and Gabriella was crying now. \"She said… um… she said she couldn\\'t spend Christmas with me,\" she said and started crying more. \"I\\'m so sorry to hear that,\" he said relieved that there wasn\\'t anything more serious. \"Do you want me to come over?\" he asked his broken girlfriend. \"No, it\\'s ok. I just need someone to talk to,\" she said sniffling a little. \"I just talked to my mom and they all wanted to meet you, so they invited you to celebrate Christmas with us.\" \"I understand if you don\\'t want to,\" he hurried to add and he could hear Gabriella laugh a little. \"Thank you Troy. I will ask my mom but I would love to. Just one thing, how are we getting there?\" she questioned and he laughed a little. \"Flying, but don\\'t worry about that,\" he told her and she laughed quietly. \"I will text you once I know ok? And thank you.\" \"For what?\" Troy asked a little puzzled. \"For just being there,\" she simply told him. \"I love you Brie,\" he told her softly. \"I love you too Troy. Goodnight,\" she said and hung up on him Gabriella walked down the stairs and found her mother in the sofa on her laptop. \"Mom?\" she started and Maria looked at her daughter. \"Yes?\" \"I called Troy and he told me that his family invited me to spend Christmas with him.\" she explained \"Can I?\" she asked hopefully. \"How are you going to get there? I\\'m sure it is a little late to get plane tickets now,\" Maria said doubtfully looking at her daughter. \"He said we were going to fly, but that I shouldn\\'t worry about that,\" Gabriella told her mother. \"If he has a plan then I\\'m sure it\\'s ok, so yes you can,\" she told her daughter with a nod of her head. \"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" she said and hugged her mother tightly. \"I just want to know when you are leaving and what the plan is,\" she told her daughter sternly. \"No problem mom,\" Gabriella said before walking back up to her room. She said yes! Gabriella texted her boyfriend and a call came through, accepted it she heard her boyfriend\\'s voice. \"That\\'s great!\" Troy said at once. \"She just wanted to know when we are leaving and was wondering how we were getting there. Isn\\'t it a little late to get an extra plane ticket?\" she asked her boyfriend sceptically and he laughed a little. \"No because we are not going to fly commercially,\" he said. \"Oh?\" Gabriella said surprised. \"They are all so worried about security because no-one in Etrea knows that I am in America, so therefor we\\'re flying to Los Angeles where the Etrean Royal plane is, and from there we\\'re flying to Iwaki,\" he explained to her. \"Do you know how long it will take?\" \"From Albuquerque to Los Angeles it takes approximately two hours and from there to Etrea, twelve hours. If you are scare of flying I can assure you it is a hundred percent safe,\" he told her and Gabriella smiled at his thoughtfulness. \"No it\\'s not that,\" she assured him. \"It just seems a little surreal. By the way when are we leaving?\" Gabriella continued. \"We\\'re leaving early on the 21st. A car will pick us up around three thirty in the morning and from there were flying out around four in the morning. We are leaving Los Angeles just before six thirty and from there it is a twelve-hour flight to Iwaki. I recon we will be at the castle around seven in the evening American time,\" Troy told his girlfriend. \"I\\'m nervous about meeting your parents. Do they have certain expectations?\" Gabriella asked nervously. \"No, of course not. What are you most nervous about?\" \"Your entire family is royal Troy. Your grandparents are the king and queen of the country I\\'m visiting and your parents are the crown prince and princess. All I can think about is how to not make a fool of myself,\" Gabriella said voicing her concerns. \"You won\\'t make a fool of yourself Gabriella. I will help you but I am certain you won\\'t need my help. I also know for a fact that they are going to love you. It is hard not to,\" Troy said and Gabriella smiled to herself. \"Thank you Troy. I\\'ll see you at school tomorrow?\" Gabriella asked him. \"Why don\\'t I meet you outside of your house before eight and we can walk to school together?\" Troy asked her and he knew she was smiling. \"I\\'d like that. Goodnight Troy. I love you.\" \"I love you too. Goodnight,\" Troy said and they ended their conversation. Thursday 20 th of December Gabriella\\'s POV \"So Gabriella how are you spending you holiday?\" Taylor asked on the last day of school. \"Troy\\'s parents asked if I wanted to celebrate with them, and since mom couldn\\'t get off work she thought that was better than me being alone,\" I answered smiling a little. \"That was nice of them. Are you nervous?\" Taylor asked me putting a couple of books in her locker, while taking out others. \"Yes I am a little nervous, and I don\\'t really know why,\" I answered lying about the last part. \"Maybe it\\'s because you are dating, and all they can associate you with is a name,\" Taylor said diplomatically. \"Maybe,\" I answered thoughtfully. At the end of the day I was standing by my locker when Troy walked over. \"Hi Troy,\" I said putting away most of my books. \"Are you home alone?\" he asked me and I sighed nodding. \"Yeah. Mom left yesterday,\" I told him. \"I\\'ll walk you home and you then you can come over,\" he suggested. Troy stood over the stove cooking dinner for us while I was sitting on the kitchen island. \"What are you making?\" I asked him not recognizing the smell. \"I know for a fact that you like fish, but don\\'t eat it often. Therefore, I am making Teriyaki Tilapia,\" he told me but I had no clue what that was. \"Ok,\" I said a little sceptical \"What is it?\" I questioned and got down to stand beside him. \"Teriyaki Tilapia is rice, fish and different herbs with teriyaki sauce. The herb salad is cilantro leaves and mint leaves with some crushed red pepper,\" Troy explained to me. \"All I can think about is Asian food when I see this,\" I told him taking in the smell once more. \"That is not strange. Most Etrean food is inspired by Japan and Australia or a combination of those two,\" he told me as he turned off the stove. \"There. Dinner is served,\" he said as we sat down eating. \"Mmm, this is great,\" I said taking another bite. \"I\\'m glad you like it. People not raised in Etrea, tend to not like it,\" he said and I was a little shocked by it because this was delicious. \"So we\\'re leaving at 3:30?\" I asked and he nodded. \"What time do we need to get up?\" I questioned. \"I would say about two forty-five, then I think we should have a fair amount of time,\" he told me and I nodded. \"I\\'m sorry I haven\\'t had the time to make the guest bedroom. I can do it after dinner unless you want to?\" he questioned me. \"I don\\'t mind,\" I said and I noticed that my cheeks got a little hot. \"Are you finished?\" he asked and I nodded. \"Do you want to do something or just head to bed?\" he asked me collecting the plates. \"I think I just want to head to bed. It\\'s getting kind of late and we have to get up early,\" I said to him. \"Ok.\" Troy nodded. \"Yell if there is anything,\" he told me, kissing my cheek before I got what I needed and headed into the bathroom. Fifteen minutes later Troy entered the bedroom and was quick in the bathroom before he crawled into bed with me. \"Is that my shirt?\" he asked me with a smile and I had to laugh. \"Maybe,\" I told him innocently laying my chin on his right shoulder. \"Good night Brie.\" \"Good night Troy,\" I said and fell asleep. And that was it! Please leave a review telling me what you think! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 11] ['A huge shout out to Pumkinking 5 and the guest review by Simone! I loved to hear from you both, you made my day! This chapter is way longer than I planed and it is sort of part one of two or three. Not what I thought would happen when I started writing. Please tell me what you think about this chapter. Love it or hate it? Sorry about some grammar and punctuation mistakes. I write in Word and uploade it to the site, and when I go in and edit the chapter after I have uploaded it inot Doc Manager, it tends to mess something up as I go over it. Again I\\'m sorry about that. Now here is chapter 11! Gabriella\\'s POV \"Brie. Brie. We need to get up,\" he said and I opened my eyes slowly.\"It\\'s too early,\" I mumbled and he laughed quietly. \"I know but I promise you that you can sleep on the plane,\" he told me kissing my lips softly. \"That was a better wake up,\" I said now opening my eyes fully. \"We are leaving in forty-five minutes,\" he told me gently and I got out of bed. \"How is the weather like when we\\'re landing?\" I questioned going through my packed bag. \"We will be landing at eleven in the morning local time, and last time I checked there would be sunny and a couple of minus degrees,\" he told me and I found a pair of jeans, a top and a jacket. I was quick getting ready in the bathroom and when I was finished Troy were just zipping his bag shut. I packed my last things and zipped my own bag shut. I looked inside my small bag and checked that I had everything such as my phone, passport and other things that I needed. I took my bag and sat them down by the front door and found Troy in the kitchen. \"You have everything?\" Troy asked and I nodded yawning. \"Breakfast?\" \"No thanks. But I wouldn\\'t call it breakfast,\" I told him and he raised an eyebrow. \"Then what would you call it?\" he wondered walking closer to me. \"A good old fashioned mid-night snack,\" I told my boyfriend and he burst out laughing. \"You\\'re something else,\" he smiled as I looked through his bookshelf. \"Looking for something?\" he asked me turning to look at me. \"Not really, but I think I\\'ve lost my copy of Stars of Magic,\" I told him with a sight. \"What happened?\" he asked sounding surprised even though I suspect he wasn\\'t innocent in this situation. \"I wanted to take it with me since we\\'re going to Etrea, but I couldn\\'t find it anywhere home,\" I explained to him. There was a knock at the door and Troy went over to answer it. \"Good morning Troy,\" the voice of a young man was heard. \"Good morning Ted. It\\'s good to see you again,\" Troy said to the man at the door. \"You too. What happened to your wrist?\" Ted asked having noticed the arm \"Broke it after I fell the other day. Nothing serious,\" he told him reassuringly. They spoke about something quietly that I didn\\'t hear, before Ted spoke up again no more than a minute later. \"Are you ready to leave?\" Ted asked not having noticed me yet. \"Almost, come there is someone I want you to meet,\" Troy said and Ted walked inside. I looked away from the bookshelf and towards the two men entering. \"Ted this is my girlfriend Gabriella. Gabriella, this is my bodyguard Ted,\" Troy introduced us. Ted appeared to be in his mid-30\\'s, around 6 feet tall, had black short hair and was dressed casually. If you saw them on the street together, you could think he was Troy\\'s uncle or even older brother. The other man appeared to be much older than Ted, but about the same height with short blond hair, all dressed in a black suit with a matching tie, white shirt and a clear earpiece. \"Pleasure to meet you,\" I said holding out my hand. \"You as well miss,\" Ted said shaking my hand. \"Pleas just call me Gabriella,\" I told him a little surprised by how polite he was. Ted smiled and nodded \"Do you have everything?\" Troy asked me and I looked over at him. \"I have,\" I said to him and Troy turned towards Ted. \"Then we\\'re ready.\" \"Then let\\'s get going,\" Ted said and showed us the way out where two black Mercedes CDI were parked. By the car there was another man dressed in a black suit and another man behind the wheel of the second car. Ted opened the door to the second car and I got in first. Troy sat down beside me and Ted closed the door before he sat down in the front passenger seat. Just after he had sat down the car drove off towards the airport. \"How are you?\" Troy asked me quietly taking my hand. \"Exited, nervous,\" I told him feeling the butterflies in my stomach. \"It\\'s going to be all right. They are all excited to meet you,\" he told me and we sat in comfortable silence for the rest of the journey. It didn\\'t take long before the car stopped at the airport and Ted opened the door for us. Troy walked out first and helped me out afterwards. The noise hit me at once and we were standing right by the small plane. Me having no clue what type of plane it was, the best way to describe it was as a typical small private plane. Troy was the first of us that walked on board and I followed him. Once I entered the jet, the interior was all a cream white colour with golden accent and details all around. The seats were much larger than on a normal airliner, and the fabric looked to be white leather. The first couple of seats were taken by men dressed in business suits but they looked nothing like the men other men we had previously seen. These looked more like Australian or Asian ethnicity. Troy walked to the back of the plane and sat down on the left side in the chair that was turned backwards. I sat down opposite of him and I noticed that Ted sat in the sofa behind Troy. We fastened our seatbelts and I felt the plane start moving. It was then I noticed that it was only Ted who entered the plane out of all the guards that was with us. Troy looked over at me and gave me a reassuring smile as the plane moved faster and we soon took off into the night sky leaving Albuquerque behind. \"How are you doing?\" Troy asked me and I looked from the window over to him. \"Good but this is all a little over whelming,\" I told him honestly and he put his hand on the table that was between us. I put my hand into his hand he caressed my hand lovingly. \"I know it is, but I am really glad that you wanted to celebrate with me and my family,\" he said to me and I smiled sheepishly. \"I\\'m happy I got the opportunity,\" I said as I relaxed more into the seat as we got closer and closer towards California. Before I knew it we had landed in LA and the private jet were taxing down the runway. I found my phone and turned it on when I heard Troy\\'s voice: \"You all right?\" he asked and I looked up from my phone to meet his eyes. \"Yeah, I\\'m just sending a message to my mom telling her we have landed safely,\" I told him and started texting my mom. I put my phone in my pocket as the plane now had stopped. A man I presumed came from the security team approached us and looked at Troy. \"Your highness, we\\'re ready,\" the man said and nodded towards Ted before he walked away. \"This is exactly why I prefer Ted,\" Troy muttered and Ted chuckled behind us. With the small bag over my shoulder, Troy leaded me out and as my feet hit the tarmac, my gaze landed on the massive plane in front of us. \"Wow!\" was the only thing I could say stunned by the sheer size of the plane. We were thirty, or so, feet away from it and Troy must have seen my expression because he was smiling looking at me. \"Come on,\" he said taking my hand and guided me over towards the plane. The closer we came the only thing I could compare it with was the Air Force One, even though this looked to be bigger. Together we walked up the metal stairs and entered the plane. The first sight that meet me was a set of stairs on the left side along with a door at the end. Troy however, walked towards the right and down a narrow hallway. The floors had a dark red carpet, while the walls with the windows were white and on the other side it looked to be a dark wood of some sorts. He walked past all of this and then the space opened up. The hallway continued down the length of the plane, but on our right side there was a big oak table with four leather office chairs, two on each side. Troy sat down closest to the window and as I sat down I noticed how comfortable the chairs were, and that we were alone. I couldn\\'t hear a sound except for the engines running. We fastened our seatbelts and my eyes landed on Troy\\'s. \"What\\'s on your mind?\" he asked gently, as if he could read it. \"This is all so strange,\" I confessed. \"Where is everyone?\" I continued to question as the plane slowly started moving. \"Well, the people working on the plane is in the staff area upstairs, Ted along with the rest of the security is all upstairs in their meeting room,\" he explained as I looked out the window, just in time to see the flaps of the plane move up and down. \"This area is where the royal family or other guests sit, while there is a press section upstairs. I can show you around later on,\" he continued to explain as the plane started moving again. Absentmindedly I grabbed his hand and he squeezed it gently. \"You all right?\" he questioned looking down on me. \"Is now a bad time to say that I don\\'t mind flying, but I\\'m not a big fan either?\" I questioned and he gave me a sympathetic smile. \"Not at all,\" he told me squeezing my hand lightly again. \"You look a little pale,\" he observed looking at me. \"Mhm,\" I said nodding, not really feeling great. Troy pulled me as close as he could and I put my head on his shoulder, while he wrapped his right hand around my shoulders, comforting me by moving his hand up and down my arm. There was a loud rumbling of the engines before we suddenly started moving. Fast. I sunk back into the seat as the massive plane left the runway and flew into the clouds of the sky. The knot in my stomach was still there but as Troy and I continued to talk, my mind drifted off and I didn\\'t think more about it. As we were well up in the sky Troy gave me a tour of the plane. The back of the plane was just seats for when there were extra guests on-board, afterwards he showed me the medical office, where a petite woman, with jet black hair tied back onto a ponytail, was working inside the small doctor office. \"Hello your highness,\" she smiled and greeted us and I had to say it was strange to hear someone formally address Troy. \"Pamela, how many times do I have to tell you to call me Troy?\" he asked with a smile. \"Probably more than I can count,\" she said with a shrug of her shoulders. \"I see you brought a guest home for Christmas?\" she continued asking. \"Yes this is my girlfriend Gabriella, Gabriella this is Pamela,\" he introduced us. \"Nice to meet you,\" I said shaking her hand. \"You as well. If you don\\'t feel well, come and find me and I\\'ll fix you,\" she told me and I smiled at her. \"I appreciate that.\" We continued upwards the hallway and he showed me the king\\'s office, meeting rooms before we stopped by the galley. \"It smells so good,\" I said as we neared us. \"You getting hungry?\" he asked me looking back at me, and I was nervous about him tripping over something. \"Yeah,\" I answered with a nod. \"I think they are working on the breakfast,\" he said and smiled. \"Good morning chef Alberto,\" Troy greeted as we walked into the galley. \"Good morning or should I say good night?\" he asked and laughed. Alberto, like most of the people, had black, short hair. As I looked at him, his eyes looked to be green and his face was slightly oval. \"You\\'re having fun with the time zones,\" Troy said rising an eyebrow smiling, amusement clearly showing in his voice. \"Is there anything I can do for you today?\" he asked stopping with the cooking, pretending not to notice what had just happened. \"I was just showing Gabriella around,\" he said and it was first then that Alberto noticed me. \"Hello I am Alberto it is nice to meet you,\" he said putting out his hand, after taking of his plastic glove. \"I\\'m Gabriella and it\\'s nice to meet you too,\" I said shaking his hand giving him a polite smile. \"We are working on the breakfast is there anything special you want?\" Alberto asked looking at us both. I took a quick glance over at Troy, only to find him looking at me. \"Food,\" I said shrugging my shoulders. \"I think we can manage that,\" Alberto said smiling at the two of us. \"Do you drink coffee?\" he asked me but I shook my head. \"No I don\\'t,\" I told him. \"We\\'ll bring out breakfast soon,\" Alberto told us with a nod of his head, and went back to prepping. \"Thank you,\" Troy said with a smile and he turned to me again. \"There is one last thing I want to show you,\" told me and we walked past the door we entered and I saw that there was a set of stairs on the right but we walked past them. He opened a door that was just a couple of meters from the stairs and we walked inside. It was a bedroom with two single beds, both of the beds had a blue/turquoise cover with the Etrean royal seal on. The wall behind the beds had a fuzzy blue wallpaper and on the two other walls were white with windows. \"This is where we sleep during longer flights, and the beds can be made into couches if there is need for extra meeting place,\" he explained and I looked at him. \"The animal on the seal, is that an owl?\" I questioned and he smiled nodding. \"It is,\" he confirmed. \"Is there a reason why?\" I questioned and he started explaining. \"Owls are some of the smartest animals that exist, and Etrean people like to think that they are smart, hence why we have the owl. The shield with the crown is because Etrea is a monarchy but slightly different from other monarchy countries and lastly the words Spera in cognitionis, Spera in rege, is actually Latin, and means Trust in knowledge, trust in the king. To be honest that is all I know in Latin,\" he said with a laughed. \"Why write in Latin when you speak English and Japanese?\" I questioned him puzzled. \"To be honest I have asked myself that so many times, and I still have no answer,\" he said shaking his head. \"Can you tell me about your favourite memory from a trip with this plane?\" I asked him as we were sitting eating breakfast. \"It was my first trip in the plane, or on a plane for that matter. I was five years old and my grand-parents wanted to take me on one of their visits, and I couldn\\'t believe we were flying in this plane. I spent the entire time discovering and ended up sitting in the cockpit,\" he told me as it looked like he re-called the memory. \"What did your grand-parents say to that?\" I wondered smiling at him. \"They laughed when the captain followed me down again. After we landed that it,\" he said and we both were laughing at this point. \"So you said earlier that you\\'re usually fourteen when you celebrate Christmas. Who is coming to celebrate?\" I questioned him. \"We\\'re sixteen, seventeen with you,\" he said and I nodded. \"And it\\'s a lot of my mom\\'s family actually, She\\'s the one of us that has a bigger family. Grandma also had a sibling, but as the years went on we didn\\'t stay in touch, and they started their own traditions and we stopped talking. I don\\'t think grandma speaks to them at all and they just became distant.\" he said before he continued. \"My mom has two siblings, an older brother and younger sister. Her sister is named Adriana and is married to Gael, and they have twins Makayla and Calvin who are the same age as us. Moms older brother, Hendric married Violet and they have Bridget who is 22 and engaged to Ben. Together they have a two-year-old named Natalia. And of course mom\\'s parents Keith and Kathleen\" he listed to me and I tried to remember it all. \"Ok, so its Keith and Kathleen who have Hendric, Lucille and Adriana. Hendric and Violet?\" I questioned and he nodded his head. \"They have Bridgett, who is engaged to Ben and they have Natalia,\" I said to him and he nodded. \"Adriana is married to Gale and they have the twins Makayla and... oh his name started on Ca something,\" I said annoyed and waited to see if I could remember it. \"I\\'m blank.\" I declared. \"Calvin,\" Troy supplied and I nodded. \"Then there is the two of us and your parents and grandparents,\" I said and he nodded. \"That would be all of them,\" he told me with a nod. Troy had just woken me up telling me that we would be landing within the hour. I had slept for the past five hours and I felt better than when we took off in LA. Walking out of the bedroom I found Troy and sat down beside him. \"Good morning,\" he said with a smile and I gave him a look shaking my head. \"It\\'s almost five thirty back home,\" I complained and he just started cracking up. \"Says the girl who slept for the past five hours,\" he laughed kissing my temple. \"Hey look outside,\" he said and as I looked out the airplane window I got my first look at Etrea. \"Wow,\" I muttered in awe and I felt the plane turn and starting it\\'s descending. \"Are we far from the castle?\" I questioned suddenly not remembering the capital. Wow, great Gabriella! \"Downtown Iwaki and the castle is to our right so I don\\'t think we\\'re able to see it. The airport is about half an hour from the castle,\" he said to me and I nodded. As we were descending into the clouds the plane started shaking a little due to the turbulence and I grasped Troy\\'s hand again. He squeezed it reassuringly and kissed the back of my hand. We got closer and closer to the ground and I could see more and more snow on the plains. As I was wondering if we were ever to hit the runway, the black and white asphalt were visible and with a soft thud we were down on the ground. The engines rumbled loudly as all four of them were working on stopping the plane and I had a knot in my stomach again. This time I knew it was because within the hour I was meeting Troy\\'s family. All of them. Looking out the window again I noticed we were going to the right away from the airport and to a secluded area of the airport where there also were two massive hangars. \"Are you ready?\" Troy asked me as the plane slowed down to a complete stop. \"I\\'m ready,\" I told him more confident than I was. That was it! Whew, this wasn\\'t meant to be this long, yet alone in two different chapters! I have cut out a lot because I feel like it wouldn\\'t have been as important, yet I didn\\'t feel like I could fit in the meeting with Troy\\'s family. If anyone is wondering, the plane that they are flying is a converted Airbus A380. Yes, I was inspired by the American Air force one, but I changed a couple of things. What I have said about the plane part is only based on research I have done on Google and a documentary from National Geographic channel name On board Obama air force one. I know these two chapters might have been boring to read, but they have sort of been important for the rest of the story –an a possible sequel?- BTW I own Etrea and the characters and places there. If there is anything else out there that is similar I sweat that is just a coincidence. Please tell me what you think, I love to hear from you! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 12] ['I\\'m so so sorry this is late! –If I dare to say it- School has kicked my arse! I haven\\'t told you guys but I am doing the IBDP –also known as International Baccalaureate Diploma Program- If anyone know anything about it I blame the Written task 1 proposal draft along with CAS! I have signed up for Red Cross and that is taking up a lot of my time now. I have to pass basic courses in order to join it and that is what I am doing basically every weekend now on. I promise you I write whenever I can but school goes first.

A HUGE shout-out to: Pumkingking5, Simone and Gwen Meinford for her encouraging words and pointing out one spelling mistake I have made! Yes I meant to write Decathlon and not declaration. Friday December 21 st Looking out the window again I noticed we were going to the right away from the airport and to a secluded area of the airport where there also were two massive hangars. \"Are you ready?\" Troy asked me as the plane slowed down to a complete stop. \"I\\'m ready,\" I told him more confident than I was. The first thing I noticed as I walked out of the plane was how cold it was. Wrapping the jacket more around myself, we walked down the stairs, and again there was two black cars waiting on us. This time there were two SUV\\'s with tinted windows, and I had a feeling they were bulletproof. It sure looked like it. Beside the cars there were several security people including Ted. Ted was holding the door open for us, and Troy let me get in first, before he sat down beside me. Just as Ted had done in Albuquerque he got into the passenger seat, and the car drove off. As it turned out of the airport an onto the main road, a cop car with blue lights drove in front of us. Everything seemed so surreal as the scenery passed by us. The landscape was beautifully covered in snow, almost like in a fairy-tale. As we had been driving for almost twenty minutes we exited the main highway, and by the looks of it we were driving just outside of the town. The roads didn\\'t look to be old because there were two lanes going in each direction. Suddenly the cop car turned off its light and continued ahead as we turned to the left and up ahead I saw a beautiful snow covered castle. \"Wow,\" I said amazed looking out the window as we drove up the long hill. The front of the castle had a big yard that was fenced off from the public, with the exception of two large gates. The front of the building was painted orange and was approximately four stories tall, with black frames around the windows. At least that was the colour that shone through the snow that was laying on the windows. The rest of the castle appeared to be white and at least three to four stories tall. Excluding the towers that stood out from the rest of the castle. One of the gates were open as we passed through it and around to a large set of stairs, that I assumed were the main entrance. The car stopped and Ted got out to open the door for us as Troy walked out first and me following him. He lead me straight up towards the front door, if you could even call it that. The door was a double oak door and it was at least two stories tall. Troy pushed the door open easily and we walked inside. The foyer inside was huge. By the looks of it you could easily have fit a family house inside. The walls were a light beige colour with white trims and details on the wall. The room must have been two stories at least, because when I looked up the ceiling was white with golden accented details in the four corners and a huge chandelier was lightning up the room along with some lights on the wall. I also noticed a couple of candelabras hanging around. The entire floor had a beautiful red carpet that looked to continuing down the hallway on the opposite side. A woman entered from a door to our right and she appeared to be about the same height as Troy. She had a beautiful mix of dark red and brown coloured hair that reached her shoulders. She was casually dressed in a pair of black jeans with a white and blue striped shirt. \"Oh it is good to see you again Troy,\" the woman said hugging Troy. \"It is good seeing you as well ma,\" Troy said with a smile kissing his mother\\'s cheek. The woman turned to me and gave me a warm. reassuring smile and it was then I saw that her eyes was a dark green colour. \"You must be Gabriella. I am Lucille Bolton,\" she said shaking my hand. \"It\\'s a pleasure to meet you Mrs. Bolton,\" I told her giving her a nervous smile. I didn\\'t know if I was supposed to curtesy or not! \"Oh please call me Lucille dear,\" she said with a smile that made me feel better at once. \"How was the flight?\" Lucille asked the two of us. \"It was great. Very easy going.\" \"I am glad to hear that. Now come on, we do not have all day,\" Lucille answered and we followed her. We walked across the room and down the hallway on the other side. It was different ancient pictures and beautiful lights along the hallway. Lucille told me a couple of things as we walk past certain paintings and I had to admit I was really fascinated how much they knew about their family, dating back centuries. Opening another door, this only being slightly taller than an average door, we stepped inside this beautiful room with a grand staircase in the middle. It opened onto a platform, before it went on to the right and left, and onto the second floor with several doors on each side. The floor was a light hardwood and the walls were a baby blue colour, all matched my white coloured candelabras that was converted into normal 21st century lights. \"Why don\\'t you show her to her room Troy and then the two of you can join us latter?\" Lucille asked and Troy nodded with a smile. \"Of course.\" \"Come on,\" he said taking my hand before lading me up the staircase and to the right. There were three doors and we walked past the first one and he opened the second one leading me inside \"This is your room,\" he told me stepping aside. Walking inside looking around it was enormous. A large queen sized bed stood on the wall to the right and the room was beautifully decorated with dark wooden items. It looked beautiful against the royal blue wallpaper. Three relatively big windows were on the wall with white thick curtains. A door was also on the same wall as the bed. \"Wow. It\\'s beautiful,\" I said looking around once more. \"If you go inside that door there is a bathroom,\" he told me watching me look around. \"Really?\" I asked amazed still taking in my surroundings. \"Mhm, and if there should be anything my room is right next door,\" he told me walking out. Curiously I followed him and he opened the last door walking inside. His room was pretty much the same except the walls had a different colour and he had photos of himself and some of his friends, a bookshelf with books along with some other personal items. \"It\\'s different,\" I said looking around. \"Yeah,\" he said scratching the back of his neck and I gave him a smile. Meanwhile: Lucille had left the two teens and she could clearly sense that Gabriella was nervous. Walking back to where she last saw her husband she found him along with Alexander and Amelia all talking. \"Ah there you are,\" Jack said as she closed the door to the sitting room. \"I was starting to wonder where you had wandered off,\" he said and Lucille shook her head. \"I did not. It is almost twelve, Troy and Gabriella arrived,\" she said and both Alexander and Amelia smiled. \"Splendid! How are they?\" Alexander asked looking at Lucille as she sat down on the couch opposite of them. \"Good, except that I think poor Gabriella is terrified.\" \"Oh I could only imagine. I remember when I was meeting Alexanders family for the first time,\" Amelia said placing a hand on her chest. Troy pushed open the door and the two of us walked inside the room where I saw both is parents and grand-parents. \"Hello,\" he said as we walked up to them. \"Oh Troy it is so good to see you again,\" his grand-mother said and went over to hug her. \"You too sobo,\" he said giving her a hug before kissing her cheek. \"Grandma, grandpa this is Gabriella. Gabriella this is my grandparents,\" Troy introduced us. \"Pleasure to meet you. I am Alexander,\" Troy\\'s grandfather introduced himself. Alexander was tall and I would say he was about 5\\'7 feet. He had black short hair, with some grey along the edges and the same blue eyes as Troy had. He too was casually dressed in dark jeans, a shirt with a sweater overtop. \"It\\'s a pleasure meeting you too sir,\" I told him politely and all he did was giving me a small chuckle. \"Please everyone in the family calls me Alex,\" he said with a smile. \"Hello, I am Amelia,\" Troy\\'s grandmother introduced herself and I shook her hand. Amelia had brown grey hair, green eyes and appeared to be around 5\\'5 feet. She was dressed in a dark blue cardigan, a pair of white jeans and some sort of pendant around her neck, that appeared to have the same seal as the one I saw on the plane. \"Pleasure meeting you,\" I said giving her a smile before I turned towards his dad greeting him. Jack Bolton was even taller than his parents. I estimated he was around 6\\'2 and with me only being 5\\'0, it was a little intimidating. Jack, like his father, had the same blue eyes but his hair was dark brown, almost black. \"Please just call me Jack,\" he said to me after I had formally greeted him as Mr. Bolton as well. Troy and I sat down beside each other in the third couch there that stood vertically of the two other couches. \"How is America?\" Amelia asked interested looking at the two of us. \"It is great. Actually quite different from here but a good kind of different. The biggest part is how engaged everyone is in different after-school clubs and activities,\" Troy answered looking at his grandmother. \"What about you Gabriella. Are you participating in any activities?\" Alexander asked. \"I am. Me and one of my close friend is leading the scholastic decathlon team and this past semester I was in the school\\'s musical along with Troy,\" I told them and Amelia smiled. \"I heard about that event. Amusing situation really,\" she said with a smile and I nodded agreeing. \"It is a shame your mother could not join us in celebrating. We would all have loved to meet her,\" Alexander told me. \"Yeah, it was unfortunate that she couldn\\'t get time off work. I am sure she would have loved to come,\" I told him agreeing. \"So I wanted to hear, how did you meet?\" Amelia questioned and it took me by surprise. \"Grandma!\" Troy exclaimed surprised. \"Oh I am just messing with you,\" Amelia chuckled. \"I already heard the story,\" she added with a wink towards us. \"Troy have you showed her around and down towards the stables?\" Lucille asked curiously and I looked at Troy who shook his head. \"No we have not gotten that far.\" \"I think you should do that today before the rest of my family arrives tomorrow,\" Lucille answered. \"It could be a bit much tomorrow. Also, have a look and see if you spot Misty. I was down there a couple of days ago because it was freezing and she did not show herself,\" Lucille said and Troy frowned. \"That is highly un usual. I will see if I can see something,\" Troy said and rose from the couch. I followed him and I think we walked the same way back to our rooms. \"I hope they didn\\'t intimidate you too much,\" Troy apologized to me. \"No I wouldn\\'t say that…\" I trailed off not knowing what to say next. \"Ok, so why don\\'t you grab a warm jacket before we head outside?\" he asked and I nodded. I was quick in finding my jacket and scarf, and Troy stood waiting outside of my door. \"We are just taking a quick detour inside the kitchen,\" he told me and we walked inside the first door. The room was just a smile library and Troy walked over to the bookshelf and pulled one book to the side. Taking a step back the bookshelf opened revealing a secret hallway that was lit up by torches. \"Where is this going?\" I questioned following him along the narrow brick halls. \"Down to the kitchen,\" he told me and we walked down a spiral staircase. It was much steeper than I had anticipated and at the bottom he grabbed the base of a torch and yanked it downwards, revealing a door. Walking out of there and towards the right Troy walked into the empty kitchen. Walking into what looked like a giant pantry he came out with two apples. \"I have to make it up to someone,\" he said with a smile and I raised an eyebrow. \"Who and what did you do?\" I questioned curiously and a little confused. \"I have a horse named Domino and I used to ride her quit a lot. I bet she is angry I just left her. I did tell her though,\" he said with a small laugh. The path down towards the stables was partially free for snow, but at some point we both had snow well up our legs. Of course I let Troy go first and I tried as best to walk into his footprints. Sliding the door open we walked inside the stable. The inside was a beautiful white stone walls with cobblestones on the ground along with hay patches here and there. The boxes for the horses was made out of dark wood and wrought iron. As I could see there was approximately five horses there, but a total of twenty horse boxes. Troy walked over to a beautiful black horse with a white line running down it\\'s muzzle. \"Hey,\" he greeted the horse who looked up at him and neighed. \"I brought you something,\" he said giving her the apple in his right hand. Troy looked over at me who stoop a couple of feet away. \"You can come over if you want to,\" he said to me and slowly I walked over to the two of them. \"Give her this,\" Troy said handing me the other apple. \"Keep your palm open and just lay the apple there.\" Troy told me and put the apple in the palm of my hand. \"There, and now slowly just hold it out in front of her,\" he said and the horse took the apple out of my hand and ate it. \"Her name is Domino and she\\'s an Arabian horse,\" Troy told me and I reached my hand out to pet her muzzle. \"She\\'s beautiful,\" I said in awe looking at her. I thought I heard a cat\\'s meow and I looked over at Troy. \"Was that a cat?\" I questioned confused. \"That might have been Misty. She must have heard out voices,\" Troy explained and we went into a search to find the cat. Following the cat meow we rounded a corner and by the hay a mocha coloured cat with black stripes tended to three tiny kittens. \"Aww,\" I said looking at them while Troy bent down and let Misty sniff at Troy before he started petting her. \"That is why mom didn\\'t see you here the other day,\" he said petting Misty. Suddenly I felt something push into my shoes and looking down there was a tiny kitten. Wait, there was still three kittens with Misty… Picking up the small kitten I walked over to one of the stables and looked inside. There all curled together on top of the hay was four more kittens all looking like Misty. Placing the kitten down with its siblings I walked back to Troy. \"Um Troy, Misty didn\\'t just get three kitten,\" I called out to him and he came over to me looking down in the horse box. \"Oh wow. So Misty have three and here it is five, which makes it eight kittens. They don\\'t look to be particularly old,\" Troy said. \"Maybe a week?\" he suggested. \"Does it get cold in the night?\" I wondered a little concerned because of the temperature now. \"A little, the stable is heated but I strongly think we should get them inside,\" Troy said and I tried to think of the best way to get them inside. \"We could use my scarf to carry some of them and keep them warm until we get them inside,\" I suggested. \"Great idea and I can take Misty with me now so she knows we\\'re not stealing her kittens,\" Troy said and he went over to take her. I managed to carefully carry three of the kittens in my scarf at a time and we started walking back up towards the castle. \"This way,\" Troy said as he had Misty inside his jacket, only with her head sticking out. He opened a wooden door and we walked inside and to the right where we came into the kitchen. We put the cats down on the floor and Misty walked over to her children at once. \"If you go inside there,\" Troy said and pointed towards what looked like a pantry, \"you will find a box and I can find a thick blanket,\" he continued and I found the box. I opened it and the edges wasn\\'t more than an inch high. Troy cane back with the blanket and put them inside the box. Placing it into a warm corner we put Misty and her kittens inside the box. Walking back to the stable we managed to get the reaming five kittens with us. \"There,\" I said putting the last one inside the box Misty was happily tending to her children and I could imagine she was happy about being somewhere warmer. \"What are we going to do when we go back to America?\" I questioned Troy looking at the cats. \"I have no clue.\" That was it! Long chapter I know! Please leave a review and tell me what you think, I greatly appreciate it! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 13] ['Hello! I\\'m sorry this is a little late but last week was crazy with tests and Red cross before fall break! I have used fall break to type up a couple of chapters so hopefully it will be better. Huge shout-out to Pumkingking5 for reviewing you are amazing for your continues support! Hope you all like this chapter: \" What are we going to do when we go back to America?\" I questioned Troy looking at the cats. \"I have no clue.\" Saturday December 22 nd It was currently six in the evening and the two teens had just finished eating dinner and cleaned up. Both Troy and Gabriella were sitting on the floor beside the box looking at the cats. \"It\\'s a shame they are only a week old. Otherwise maybe I could have taken one with me,\" Gabriella said petting one that was curled up in her lap. \"And what would your mother have said?\" he questioned with a smile looking at the cat in her lap. \"Oh mom I spent Christmas in a country across the world and I brought a cat with me home,\" he said and Gabriella burst out laughing at his imitation. \"Ok, ok I see your point,\" she laughed and Misty crawled into her lap to retrieve her kitten. \"We do have one problem though,\" Troy said out loud and Gabriella shifted her gaze from the cats towards her boyfriend. \"Misty needs to eat as well and I have no clue what,\" he told her and they heard a door open and close with a soft thud. Footsteps was approaching the two teens and Troy shifted so he was sitting in front of the box. A woman stepped into the secluded kitchen area. Her brown hair was tied neatly into a ponytail, and she was wearing a black dress with a white apron that had frills along the edges along with black shoes. \"Good afternoon,\" she said with a sweet smile. \"Hello Maggie,\" Troy replied with a smile \"I don\\'t believe you have meet my girlfriend Gabriella,\" Troy introduced and Maggie gave the young girl a smile. \"So what are the two of you doing down here? On the floor?\" she questioned suspiciously and before Troy had the chance to answer Misty jumped out of the box and stretched out on the tiled floor. \"Well well, who do we have here. Is it little miss Misty,\" Maggie said and Misty walked over to Maggie to get petted. Troy moved to the side and Maggie spotted the box with kittens. \"Oh how precious,\" Maggie said looking at them. \"I was wondering where Misty went here the other day,\" she said out loud. \"What are you going to do with them?\" she questioned looking back at Troy. \"That is what we are struggling to figure out,\" Troy told Maggie with a little sigh. \"Does anyone else know about them?\" she continued to question. \"Only the three of us,\" Troy said with a nod. \"Ok so what if I later today get some food for Misty and you should think about what to do later on?\" she asked and Troy nodded. \"Sounds great,\" Troy agreed and Maggie rose up. \"See you later,\" she said with a smile walking away. Gabriella was laying in her large bed reading when there was a soft knock on the door. A little puzzled about who it could be, she called them in. \"Come in,\" she said and the door opened revealing her boyfriend. \"Oh its only you. I thought it would be someone else,\" she said with a small smile and Troy had to smile as well. \"I was just wondering how it\\'s been so far,\" he told her closing the door behind him, walking over to her bed. \"Different, that\\'s for sure,\" she said closing her book. Troy sat down beside her on the bed and she scooted closer towards him. \"But a good kind of different,\" she told him. \"I like seeing how you live. To be honest I have a hard time seeing who you really are.\" Gabriella said and Troy frowned \"What do you mean?\" he questioned and Gabriella saw that he had misunderstood what she meant. \"No not like that, but the fact that you are royal. This is your everyday life, and not the one you have in Albuquerque where everything is so much simpler,\" she told him and he smiled. \"I know it is different.\" Troy started taking her hand. \"But to me you are one of the few who see me as normal and not someone you have to be super polite to or anything like that,\" he told her and she gave him a shy smile. \"You know you can wake me during the night if there should be anything right?\" he asked and she nodded. \"I do, but can\\'t you stay a little longer?\" she questioned him and he smiled. \"Of course,\" Troy told her and she leaned her head on his chest. \"I love you Wildcat.\" Gabriella said staring into his blue eyes. \"I love you too,\" he answered and they shared a kiss before they both drifted off. Troy opened his eyes blinking a couple of times before he remembered where he was. Looking outside of the windows, it was still pitch black. Turning to look at the clock, the numbers 05:36 flashed at him. He felt Gabriella shift beside him and she opened her brown eyes looking at him. \"What time is it?\" she questioned him almost in a whisper. \"Half past five,\" he told her looking down at her almost falling back asleep. \"I guess we both feel asleep,\" she said opening her eyes more to look at him. \"Mhm… I guess I should go back to my own room,\" Troy told Gabriella who nodded sleepily. Before he walked out the door he turned around and saw that she was already fast asleep. \"Good morning,\" Troy heard the unmistakable sound of Maggie as he closed the door to Gabriella\\'s room. Turning towards right he saw Maggie come out of the small library/study. It was obvious that she had started work since she was dressed in the black dress and apron with a duster in hand. \"Good morning Maggie,\" Troy greeted with a little nervous smile looking at the elderly woman in front of him. \"What are you doing up and about at these hours?\" she asked him, her voice light and a little teasing. \"Oh, you know… Couldn\\'t sleep?\" he said not even convincing himself. Maggie smiled to herself and laughed a little. \"Oh don\\'t you worry Troy. I won\\'t tell anyone. Goodnight,\" Maggie smiled and continued down the staircase. \"Goodnight,\" Troy said mostly to himself and walked inside his own room. Getting in his own bed he fell asleep. Sunday December 23 rd Gabriella\\'s POV \"I don\\'t know If you remember but I have to join my family to church today,\" Troy told me after breakfast. \"I do remember you telling me about it,\" I nodded as we walked out of the dining room. \"When do you leave?\" I questioned looking up at him. \"Church starts at one so around twelve-thirty,\" he told me taking my hand. \"Will you manage here? I don\\'t know when the rest of my family arrives,\" he told me apologizing. \"Don\\'t worry,\" I reassured him. \"I understand you have to do this,\" I told him and he gave me a grateful smile followed by a kiss on top of my head. \"Maybe we should do some of the homework now while we have time?\" I questioned and Troy nodded agreeing. Sitting down somewhere quiet we tackled the homework we all had been assigned over the holidays. \"What are you going to do next year?\" I questioned Troy putting my book down. \"What do you mean?\" he questioned looking at me. \"I mean about college. What are you thinking about majoring, are you going to a local college here, another country or even staying in America?\" I questioned him and he looked at me surprised. \"I don\\'t know,\" he confessed. \"I sort of have to go to college here but the thought of staying in America sounds wonderful. I have been conflicted about what I want to major in. It stands between what I should do and what I want to do…\" he said trailing off and I was genuinely confused. \"But, can you choose what you want to?\" I frowned and he smiled. \"If it was just that easy,\" he said almost with a laugh in his voice. \"Everyone is waiting on what I am going to do. They are analysing the choices and decisions I make now, and try to get an idea on how I am going to rule the country eventually. I\\'m conflicted about something related to sport and theatre versus politics as most people expect me to choose,\" he told me ruefully. \"On the brighter side, I have been accepted at Royal College of Etrea, also known as RCE, where most royal and influential people get their education,\" he told me and I was confused by the whole idea. \"Take Marcus for example,\" he said breaking it down for me. \"He is going to RCE next year because his dad is working in the technology group that is under the official government,\" he explained. \"So it is mostly for the elite in the country?\" I questioned, a little harsher than intended, while frowning. \"Not exactly,\" he said trying to explain. \"The school have around 700 students each year. Most of them are from Etrea, both the \\'upper class\\' and the regular people, but they are trying to get international students from all over the world and no matter their background,\" he told me. \"So everyone can apply?\" I questioned thinking. \"Well yes. There are certain requirements for being accepted but they are open to everyone,\" Troy told me and typed something on his computer. \"Here,\" he said showing me a webpage for the school. It was a beautiful old building that was mixed with modern architecture in the front. To me it looked like a modern Hogwarts, surrounded by beautiful landscapes and four other tall buildings scattered around the campus in various styles. \"Wow. It is so unlike anything I have seen,\" I told him amazed, giving him back his laptop. \"Have you written any applications yet?\" he questioned me closing the computer. \"I have. I have applied for Yale in New York, Stanford in California and University of Albuquerque,\" I told him and he gave me a curiously glance. \"Why University of Albuquerque?\" he asked me and I shrugged a little. \"Hoping to get into Yale or Stanford is kind of optimistic. They hand select top students from all over the country, and the level is so high,\" I said noticing how stressed I was about the whole situation. \"Hey, if there is anyone that can make it, it is you,\" Troy reassured me taking my hand squeezing it. \"I know you will,\" he finished and I smiled. \"Thank you. It means a lot. The only downside will be the long-distance relationship to you,\" I told him and he scooted closer to me. \"Don\\'t think about that already. It is months away and we will make it work if we want to. It will just be some odd hours Skype calls,\" he told me with a smile kissing my cheek. Troy looked at the clock before his eyes widened. \"Oh no. I have to go change,\" he said and we both collected our books. Sitting down in one of the couches along the hallway I was partially reading the book and partially waiting for Troy. I heard him walk down the staircase and I looked towards him. He was dressed in a dark grey suit, with a matching waistcoat, white shirt and a dark blue tie in his hand. \"You look good,\" I said giving him a smile. \"You don\\'t happen to know how to tie a tie? It doesn\\'t work that well with only one hand,\" he questioned but I shook my head and rose from the sofa. \"I\\'m sorry I can\\'t help you. But I do find it quit amusing really,\" I told him and he frowned. \"Oh?\" \"Your seventeen and need help to tie your tie,\" I said with a smug voice and even Troy laughed. \"Are you mocking me?\" he questioned laughing while wrapping his hands around my waist from behind, picking me up and spinning me around. \"No Troy!\" I exclaimed while laughing as he spun me around. As he sat me down on the ground he kept a hand around my waist to steady me. \"Troy,\" his mother\\'s voice was sounded followed by the soft click of her heels on the floor. \"Oh great you are ready,\" she said with a smile \"Almost mom. Could you help me with my tie? I couldn\\'t manage it with my cast,\" he explained and Lucille smiled. \"Just stand still,\" she said and within a minute she had tied the tie. \"Thank you mom,\" he said tightening it before tucking it inside his waistcoat. \"Your dad and grandparents were going to meet us outside, so we should go now,\" Lucille told her son. \"All right. I will be back in a couple of hours,\" Troy told me looking at me. \"Don\\'t worry I will manage. Besides your family is coming soon.\" \"Bye,\" Troy said and followed his mom outside. It was only half an hour later when I heard two voices almost yelling. \"Calvin wait up!\" a female voice was heard and she soon appeared by the boy who was looking at me. They had to be the twins because they looked really alike. \"I don\\'t believe we have met,\" Makayla said exchanging her hand. \"I\\'m Makayla,\" she introduced herself. \"and that is my brother Calvin,\" she said nudging him. \"Hi,\" he greeted and I smiled. \"Nice to meet you both, I\\'m Gabriella,\" I told them both shaking Makayla\\'s hand. \"You\\'re from America,\" Calvin said as it suddenly dawned on him and I nodded. \"Yes.\" \"Calvin!\" Makayla hissed giving her brother a look. \"What do you normally do when you are here?\" I wondered looking at the two of them as Makayla thought for a minute. \"Well, we always have one snowball fight. Do you want to join us now since Troy can\\'t?\" Makayla asked and I nodded. \"I would love to…\" \"Yes! Finally, I don\\'t have to be on a team alone!\" Makayla cheered. An hour later we found ourselves outside playing in the snow, just as I had done little over a week ago in Albuquerque. \"Hey Araya,\" Makayla said and I spotted a small child a few feet away from us. It was good to get a break because Calvin had just hit me in the back of my neck with a snowball that was melting. \"Can I join?\" she questioned in her adorable voice. \"Yes, what do you want to play?\" Makayla questioned and Araya walked over to us. \"Tag your it!\" she yelled and started running towards the castle. \"What?\" I questioned and Makayla looked at me. \"Please tell me they have tag in America,\" she said and I nodded. \"Of course, I played it a lot when I was younger,\" I said to her. \"Now we have given her a sufficient head start,\" Makayla said and we all ran after her. Running inside the castle, still dressed in our outdoor clothes, we saw Araya disappear around a corner. Following her we were back in the foyer where I said goodbye to Troy a little earlier. It all happened so fast. As we were almost going to catch Araya my feet slipped from underneath of me and I tried to hold my balance. \"Ahh!\" Makayla exclaimed beside me as the two of us went crashing to the floor. Makayla, Calving and myself all lay somewhat on top of each other on the floor. Hearing footsteps I looked towards the sound and saw Troy along with the rest of his family returning from church. That was it! How do you think Troy will react and how will the Christmas celebration continue? Please leave a review telling me what you think. -FreeFlyingWriter.'][Chapter 14] ['I\\'m so sorry!

Makayla, Calving and myself all lay somewhat on top of each other on the floor. Hearing footsteps I looked towards the sound and saw Troy along with the rest of his family returning from church. Sunday December 23 rd 2007 \"Oh my,\" I heard Amelia say as Mikayla, Calvin and myself got off the floor. \"Are you all right?\" Troy asked us and we all nodded, Makayla and I still giggling a little. Troy looked a little worried at me but I gave him a reassuring smile and he visibly relaxed. \"We will see you teens later,\" Jack said and he left along with his parents and wife leaving the five of us alone. \"I need to get some dry clothes,\" Makayla announced and I knew what she meant. I was soaked to the bone. \"Come on Araya,\" she said taking the toddlers hand leading her down a hallway and Calvin followed them. Troy was just going to say something when we heard another pair of footsteps approaching us. A woman and a man I hadn\\'t seen before came the same way as Calvin, Makayla and Araya just had left. \"Hello Troy it is so good to see you again,\" a woman said as she saw the two of us. Troy meet her and she embraced him into a hug. \"Hello grandma. It is good to see you as well,\" Troy said returning the embrace. She looked to be about the same age as Amelia but she looked a lot like Lucille, yet different. \"I am so anxious to hear all about America,\" the woman gushed and a laugh could be heard from behind her. \"Let Troy breath Kathleen. I am sure he is going to tell everything eventually,\" a male said appearing behind what I assumed was his wife. \"Hello Troy,\" the man greeted Troy and they shared a hug. \"I see that everyone else has arrived,\" the woman stated looking at Troy surprisingly none of them having noticed me. \"Yes. We just returned from church so I am afraid I do not know when they came. Calvin and Makayla must have left Middlesbrough early today,\" he told her and I had no clue where that was. \"Grandma, grandfather I would like to introduce you to my girlfriend Gabriella. Gabriella this is my grandparents on my mother\\'s side Keith and Kathleen,\" he introduced us and I smiled shaking their hands. \"Hello, it is a pleasure to meet you both,\" I said and they both gave me a warm smile in return. \"You as well,\" Kathleen told me still smiling. \"Do you have a big family?\" Kathleen asked me interested as we walked towards somewhere. I didn\\'t really know, I just followed along. \"No,\" I said at once shaking my head a little. \"We don\\'t have much contact with my family since they live in Mexico so it has just been me and my mom,\" she told the two of them. \"Oh dear,\" Kathleen said with a laugh. \"I hope you are prepared. We have a big crazy family,\" she finished smiling and I had to laugh a little. \"I don\\'t think it could be that bad,\" I said mostly to reassure myself and even Troy laughed a little. \"I am sure you will all get along,\" Troy told me and we linked our hands together. \"Mom said that there was food in the kitchen if you wanted. Other than that I do not know where the others are. I think grandpa went to his office,\" Troy told them and Keith nodded. \"Lovely. We will see you later,\" Keith said and the two of them walked away. I leaned my head on Troy\\'s arm and he looked at me, squeezing my hand gently. \"You all right?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"Just tired and terribly jet lagged,\" I said and he couldn\\'t contain his smile. \"Oh come on. Don\\'t tell me you don\\'t feel it,\" I told him a little accusing. \"Can\\'t say I do. Already experienced it once and I\\'m quit used to flying through different time zones. One perk of being home schooled,\" he said with a smile and I got an idea. \"Speaking of school… We have to do the homework before we go back,\" I told him and he looked at me funnily. \"I didn\\'t…\" he stuttered. \"Come on, besides I need to change. I am soaked.\" I told him and I dragged him along and we found our books again continuing with our homework. \"Are you sure you are all right after the fall earlier?\" he questioned me worried looking at me. \"I am sure Troy,\" I said looking at him but I could still see his doubt. \"Troy.\" I leaned my head on his shoulder holding his hand. \"I promise you. I know that you are worried but trust me ok? Trust me when I say that I\\'m un-injured,\" I vowed and kissed his cheek softly. Glancing down at the book in his hand I frowned. \"What are you reading?\" \"Genjimonogatari,\" he said his whole accent changing. \"Is the Japanese name. The English name is The tale of Genji,\" he told me. \"One of the books I have to read and write a report on since to graduate and start college,\" he informed me. \"What\\'s so funny?\" \"Just you speaking Japanese. It\\'s so different. I have never really heard that language before,\" I said to him and he smiled before starting to speak Japanese. I looked at him surprised with raised eyebrows. \"What did you say I questioned him,\" cocking my head. \"Hello my name is Troy and I am seventeen years old.\" He was interrupted by the door opening. \"Troy!\" Calvin\\'s voice was heard and we both looked over at the door. \"Aunt Lucille said that dinner was ready,\" Calvin reported and looked funnily at the two of us. \"What were you doing anyways?\" he questioned suspicious. \"Calvin are you dens?\" Makayla hissed at her brother and he just gave her a look. \"Homework,\" Troy answered stopping the brewing argument. \"Homework?\" Calvin questioned and Troy nodded as we collected our stuff. \"Yes. We got homework during the holidays,\" he explained to Calvin who frowned. \"Come on,\" Makayla said annoyed dragging her brother by the arm out the door and we followed. Troy and I put our books in our room before we all made our way to the dining room. Sixteen chairs were around the table with seven on each side and one on either end. As Makayla and Calvin sat down I was relieved to see two vacant chairs beside each other. Troy and I took the last two seats and we all enjoyed the family meal. Looking at the plates I didn\\'t know what any of it was. All I could recognize was the meat on the charger. What was beside it I knew nothing about. \"This is Dry-Roasted onions and tomato beef,\" Troy whispered quietly to me. Giving him a grateful smile I received the bowl of dry-roasted onions from whoever sat next to me. Taking a spoonful, I passed it onto my right, to Troy. The tomato beef was beef marinated in tomatoes with small grilled tomatoes on the side. A bowl of baked potatoes was the last thing that was passed around before everyone started eating. \"It is so nice that we have two new faces this year,\" Alexander said and we all looked at him midway into the dinner. \"Ben who is marrying Bridgett just after the new year, and Gabriella who joined Troy all the way from America,\" Alexander said and all heads turned towards me. Feeling the heat in my cheeks I gave them a shy smile. \"I can\\'t wait for the next year,\" Alexander continued and raised his glass. \"Cheers to family and love,\" he said and everyone toasted before continuing with the meal. After dinner I was down in the kitchen along with Lucille and Adrianna doing the dishes, as Kalvin and Makayla had dragged Troy off to somewhere before he had the chance to say anything. \"So how did you and Troy meet?\" Adrianna questioned as she was stacking some hand washed items. \"Well we meet at the first day at school,\" I told her putting down a bowl I had just dried. \"The vice principal asked me to show him around and I thought that I could introduce him to some of my friends who also play basketball,\" I said with a smile and both Lucille and Adrianna started laughing. \"Oh I never get tired of hearing that story,\" Lucille smiled still laughing a little. \"I really want to know,\" Adrianna started turning towards me, \"Is it really different from America?\" \"After what Troy has told me and what I\\'ve seen it is quite different. The first thing is the government, and that we elect a president every fourth year. We don\\'t have a national language but most people speak English, and we learn Spanish at a young age,\" she told the two women. \"Um… In terms of education we have twelve years of education and then it varies depending on what you want to become. Also if you got to a community college or not,\" Gabriella tried to briefly explain. \"Interesting,\" Adrianna said putting away another bowl. \"What do you want to do next year?\" she questioned waiting on me to dry the last couple of things. \"I have decided on lawyer, but I\\'m unsure if I want to study in California which is on the west side, or in Connecticut which is not for from New York on the east side of America,\" I said and both of them had a fascinated expression on their face. \"We are done here. Thank you so much for your help Gabriella,\" Lucille thanked the teenager and dried her hands on a towel. \"No problem,\" I said with a smile, \"I\\'ll see you later,\" I said and exited the kitchen. Finding the way back towards the dining room wasn\\'t much of an issue, but as I walked out of the double doors I headed towards the right. Walking down the hallway I frowned a little as nothing seemed familiar. Then again it was only my second day here. Looking up at some of the paintings and armour that was placed had me amazed. Thinking I had hit the right door I opened it, only to find a room that was fairly dark and furniture\\'s and what not was covered by white sheets. It didn\\'t look like anyone had been there in a long time, and I suddenly got the creeping feeling that I shouldn\\'t be there. Walking out and closing the door quietly behind me I continued to walk down the hallway again trying to find the way. Trying a second door I looked inside to find yet another hallway. Closing the door with I sigh I continued to walk down the hallway in hope of finding where I was supposed to be. Looking around to gain a sense of direction some of the ornaments looked familiar. Thinking back to where I had walked I opened a third door thinking it would be the one. However, what I found inside wasn\\'t anything what I thought it would be. The room was filled with paintings, and I looked around in complete awe. My gaze landed on a picture of what appeared to be a young Troy. He was being held by Lucille and Jack was sitting beside them. Amelia and Alexander were standing behind the three of them again all smiling. Continuing to look around the room most of the walls were filled with paintings. All of them were portraits and looked a little shine when the light hit them. Looking at the clock on my phone I hadn\\'t realised how much time that had passed. With a sigh, I had to call Troy because I was past the point where I could navigate by myself. Putting the phone to my ear he answered after the third ring. \"Hey,\" his cheerful voice answered. \"Troy I got lost,\" I told him bluntly and he started laughing. \"It\\'s not funny. I\\'ve tried so many ways I can\\'t find the way back towards the dining room,\" I told him and he stopped laughing. \"All right. Can you try to explain where you are?\" he questioned patiently and I looked around. \"There\\'s a bunch of pictures here. From the floor to the ceiling,\" I said and felt stumped and a little scared. What if he didn\\'t know where I was? \"Ah!\" he started and I heard he was smiling. \"I am on my way,\" he said and with that, he ended the phone call. A door opened and my heart skipped a beat. \"Got lost?\" I heard Troy\\'s smooth voice. \"I\\'m so glad you came,\" I said relieved walking closer to him. \"Where am I?\" I questioned looking around making a gesture with my hand. \"The portrait room. It was built with the castle in the 16th century,\" he told me and I looked around once more. \"Who are these people?\" I wondered and Troy smiled at me. \"All the people on these paintings are every king that has lived in this castle and ruled Etrea. \"Wow,\" I muttered in awe. \"So you can trace your family that far back?\" I continued to question and he nodded walking closer to me. \"Yeah. Everyone has a portrait that is hanging in this room,\" he told me and he noticed that my gaze landed on the portrait of him. \"That was from the day I was baptized,\" he explained with a smile before continuing, \"I actually don\\'t think there is a recent picture here…\" I turned my head to look at him but he was already looking at me. \"What?\" I questioned quietly and he gave me one of these lopsided smiles. \"Most people who see this knows a lot of it. It feels different that you don\\'t know about this,\" he told me and I got a sinking feeling in my gut. \"I\\'m sorry Troy,\" I apologized looking down at the floor. \"No I didn\\'t mean it like that,\" he hurried to say and cupped my cheek lovingly. \"I love the fact that you don\\'t see me as any of this,\" he said gesturing to the paintings surrounding us. \"It\\'s just that I\\'m used to everyone recognizing me as a royalty and its unusual that the people I meet don\\'t know the histories,\" he said and stopped for a moment. Taking in a breath he continued. \"I love that your curious but sometimes I just forget that you have barely heard of Etrea,\" he finished and I smiled wiping away a single tear that ran down my cheek. Taking a step closer I wrapped my hands around his back and rested my forehead on his chest. \"I love you Troy,\" I told him and he kissed the top of my head. \"I love you too Brie,\" he told me and I looked at him as we shared a soft kiss on the lips. That was it for this time! Some fluff at the end! Next chapter is Christmas eve I promise! I love to hear what you all think so please leave a review. Until next time - FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 15] ['Hey again everyone! So sorry this is late but better late than never? A huge shout-out to Pumkingking5 and Simone for reviewing! Also a huge shout-out to everyone who have favorited and/or followed the story! Hope you like this chapter: Monday December 24 th Christmas eve Gabriella\\'s POV As I stepped out of my room the next morning, the whole atmosphere of the castle had changed. Walking over to the railing and leaning my hands on it, I looked down. On the floor below there was a medium sized Christmas tree standing there, beautifully decorated with ornaments and lights. I turned my head as I heard a door close and Troy walked out of his room. \"Good morning and merry Christmas,\" he said and gave me a soft kiss on the cheek. \"Good morning and merry Christmas to you as well,\" I said and gave him a soft smile. Troy leaned on the railing beside me and looked down at the tree. \"It\\'s beautiful isn\\'t it?\" he asked and I nodded almost mesmerized. It was only then that I turned towards him and noticed his left arm in a sling. \"Oh no,\" I quacked \"What happened?\" I question looking into his eyes. He was as calm as ever. \"Nothing happened, it swelled during the night. Most likely because I moved it too much yesterday,\" he reassured me with a smile and my shoulders dropped as I relaxed. As we entered the dining room there was only Calvin and Kathleen sitting there eating. \"Good morning,\" Kathleen greeted us as we entered the room. Calvin only nodded as he took a sip of the cup in front of him. Troy and I collected a plate each and sat down beside each other on the table. \"What happened to your arm dear?\" Kathleen questioned taking a sip of the juice in her glass. \"It swelled during the night. It is only a little more than a week since the surgery,\" he explained to them and Calvin gave him a look. \" Sure, because that\\'s what happened,\" Calvin spoke and I was clueless as he had, most likely, switched to Japanese. \" Give it a rest,\" Troy replied obviously annoyed by what Calvin had replied. \" Boys. Whatever it is. Cut it now. And why not speak English?\" Kathleen said strictly giving the two of them a stern look. I got an awkward feeling that whatever just happened, Kathleen had just scolded the two of them. \" Because she doesn\\'t speak Japanese.\" There was something in Calvin\\'s voice that sent a small shiver down my back. Troy placed his right hand on my thigh and rubbed it up and down reassuringly. Quietly Calvin emptied the cup and collected his plate and putting them on a cart that stood nearby. \"Merry Christmas,\" he said with a short nod and left the room. I didn\\'t know what just happened, except that there most likely had been a small argument ongoing. \"Oh dear,\" Kathleen said shaking her head slightly reaching for her cup. Troy and I started eating our breakfast and Kathleen left the dining room as she finished. \"What did you and Calvin speak about?\" I questioned uncertain taking a bit out of the egg. \"It doesn\\'t matter,\" Troy answered dismissively taking a drink of his tea. \"Don\\'t worry ok?\" he questioned and I nodded a little doubtful. A couple of hour later and Troy along with his family had left to attend the Christmas parade in downtown Iwaki. \"Hey Gabriella,\" Makayla said as she found me with my book. \"Hi. merry Christmas,\" I told her giving her a smile. \"Thanks, merry Christmas to you as well. What are you doing?\" she questioned with a small frown. \"Just reading,\" I answered casually placing the bookmark in it before closing the book and fully looking up at her. \"I was looking for you actually,\" Makayla said and now it was my turn to frown. \"Oh?\" \"I wondering if you wanted to watch the Christmas parade with me? You know since I reckoned you haven\\'t watched it before,\" she said and a smile grew on my lips. \"I\\'d love to,\" I told her happily and rose from the chair I was sitting in. Together we sat down in a living room and Makayla turned on the TV finding the right channel. The camera panned over the different fleets that were passing in the snowy streets. There were fleets with different bands playing music, Santa clause with his reindeers, -that threw packages out to the kids- and different snow themed figures that were there to entertain the children. The camera also showed a brief glimpse of Troy and the rest of his family as they stood there watching the parade all having a smile on their faces. \"Do you have anything like this in America?\" Makayla questioned turning towards me. \"No,\" I said shaking my head. \"We don\\'t even get snow in Albuquerque. Just a week ago there came about 10 centimetres I think Troy said it was, and that was a lot of snow for Albuquerque,\" I explained and Makayla looked stunned. \"I can\\'t imagine,\" she stated completely flabbergasted. \"I could never imagine Christmas eve without snow.\" We continued watching the parade and Makayla answered questions and told me about various traditions of the parade. As the hours went by, the two of us had a great time and I truly felt like I had gained a new friend that could last a lifetime. Dinner with all of Troy\\'s family as a joyful experience full of laughter and talk amongst everyone. Troy and I didn\\'t end up beside each other but it didn\\'t matter because I got to talk to Makayla and Kathleen. After desert had been served it was after nine in the evening and Araya had fallen asleep in Bridgett\\'s lap. \"I think I need to put this little one to bed,\" Bridget said and lifted up Araya before rising from the table. \"Speaking off, should we head over to the sitting room?\" Alexander asked and people nodded agreeing as we all sat down in the sitting room that had more than enough space. \"Oh that reminds me. I have to get something,\" Makayla excused herself and left before people had even sat down. \"I have something for you too,\" Troy told me quietly and I looked at him. \"You want to open it now?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"We will be back a little later,\" Troy told his relatives and we intertwined our hands before leaving the room not noticing the smile on Kathleen\\'s face. Sitting down on the bed in Troy\\'s room, I handed him the squared package. \"You want me to go first?\" he questioned and I nodded with a smile. Somehow he managed to open the package with one hand and once the brown book fell out of the wrapping paper he turned it around and smiled as he saw the front of it. \"A year at East High in Albuquerque,\" he quietly read out and opened it to the front page where there was a picture of the gang taken quite recently. Looking through the next couple of pages there was pictures, dates and small stories from when he first came to East High. \"I love it, thank you so much,\" he said and gave me a kiss. \"When did you have time to make something like this? It must have taken you quite some time,\" he said and I nodded with a little smile. \"It was easy once I found what I wanted to include, but the hardest part was keeping it a secret from you. As you can see there is a good portion of empty pages, so I figured you could add as the year continues and then you have something to look back on,\" I told him and he couldn\\'t stop smiling. \"I absolutely love it,\" he stated closing the book carefully putting it beside him. \"This is for you,\" he said giving me two presents. One of them were pretty similar in size to the one I gave him and the other one wasn\\'t much bigger than the palm of my hand. I took the biggest one and unwrapped it. A copy of Stars of Magic laid beneath the wrapping paper. \"How did you know I had lost mine?\" I questioned and he chuckled a little. \"You never lost it. Look inside,\" he said and I opened the cover of it. \" To Gabriella. I hope you find Etrea just as fascinating as this book. Best wishes Maryl Laflamme\" I read out. \"It was you who stole my book,\" I continued with a laugh. \"All with good intentions of course.\" \"Thank you Troy. That is so cool,\" I grinned and he just smiled at me. I reached for the smaller box and carefully took of the wrapping paper to reveal a white jewellery box with some brand printed in gold on the top. Carefully opening the box, the little light in the room hit the small necklace that was inside the box. It was a silver T pendant with a small red gem in the corner. \"Wow. It\\'s beautiful Troy,\" I breathed taking it out of the box. \"Normally I would ask you to put it on but…\" I said and Troy just smiled. I pushed my hair aside and fasten the necklace around my neck. \"Thank you it\\'s beautiful,\" I thanked him and I gave him a kiss. \"How is Christmas so far?\" he questioned and I smiled. \"Wonderful,\" I said touching the necklace and looking down on the book. \"That reminds me. I have something for your parents,\" I told him finding the small package. \"What is it?\" he asked curiously studying the small package. \"You have to wait and see,\" I told him with a wink. As we entered the sitting room both Makayla and Bridget had returned. Makayla smiled at me as the two of us returned sitting down in one of the sofas \"Thank you Makayla,\" Kathleen smiled as she put the present away. \"I also have something for Gabriella,\" Makayla said stepping forward handing me a small package. \"Me?\" I questioned a little surprised. \"Thank you,\" I told her as I accepted the present. Opening the wrapping paper, inside there was a small paper box. Opening that one too it revealed a snow globe of the castle. The base of it was grey with the Etrean flag. \"This is amazing,\" I said with a smile. \"Thank you,\" I told her and we shared a hug. \"I also have something for Lucille and Jack,\" I told them and gave the present to Lucille. \"How thoughtful. Thank you,\" Lucille said accepting the package. Peeling off the wrapping paper she pushed it aside to reveal a book. Looking through the first couple of pages Lucille smiled and looked back up at me. \"Is all of this American recipes?\" she questioned and I nodded. \"Most of them. There are also some Mexican recipes from my family,\" I explained to her and she went over to hug me. \"Thank you so much. This is lovely,\" she thanked me as Jack and Amelia looked through the recipes. I briefly looked over to where Calvin sat and the look he sent me wasn\\'t friendly. Why had he suddenly become so hostile towards me? What had I done towards him? Hope you all liked the chapter even though it was delayed.

To the two of you who guessed I will reveal that one of you were spot on, but of course I won\\'t tell who. –I know that\\'s mean of me- I can\\'t thank you enough and especially you Grace who gave me that kick/boost to plan properly and actually write! Hope you all enjoy! I briefly looked over to where Calvin sat and the look he sent me wasn\\'t friendly. Why had he suddenly become so hostile towards me? What had I done towards him? Gabriella\\'s POV Tuesday 25 th of December 00:58/12:58am \"I am heading to bed. Now you kids do not stay up too late,\" Lucille said following Hendric as he left the room. \"We will not. Goodnight,\" Troy said and Lucille gave us a smile before leaving the room. \"So how much do you know about cats?\" Troy questioned as the door had closed behind them. \"Some. What about it?\" Makayla questioned raising one of her eyebrows looking at Troy. \"Misty, the cat down at the stables, got kittens about a week ago and they are currently in the kitchen and we have no idea what to do about them,\" Troy explained and Calvin looked at him funnily. \"You\\'re joking?\" Calvin frowned, yet his voice sounded surprised. \"I am completely serious. But you cannot tell anyone,\" he told them. \"Mom, dad, grandma and grandpa do not know about it. All they know is that Misty came to me last time I was down in the stable,\" he continued explaining to them. \"How many cats are we talking about?\" Makayla questioned uncertainly looking at the two of us. \"Misty had eight kittens so there are nine cats currently in the kitchen. It was too cold for them to stay in the stable,\" Troy explained to his two cousins. \"Can we go down there? I love kittens,\" Makayla questioned sitting at the edge of her seat. \"Sure. I should check if they have food too,\" Troy said and we all headed down towards the kitchen. As Troy opened the wooden door to the kitchen where the cats were, we were meet with the sound of meowing and some of the kittens had wandered off from Misty. \"Aww. They\\'re so cute,\" Makayla gushed as she walked inside and started petting one of them. Troy found the bag of cat food that Maggie had bought earlier and filled the silver bowl that stood by the box. Calvin, Misty and I picked up a kitten each and placed it back in the box as Misty started to groom them. \"What are you going to do when you go back to America?\" Makayla questioned us and turned towards us, still with a cat in her arms. \"I have no idea,\" Troy said with a sigh. \"I guess we have to tell mom and dad about it at some point.\" Tuesday 25 th 11:08/11:08am I yawned as I stepped out of the shower and dried my hair with the towel. I hadn\\'t gone to bed early last night, or rather earlier this day. I put on my clothes and unwrapped my hair from the fluffy towel as I stood in front of the mirror. Running my fingers through my hair I tried to untangle it but I ended up having to brush it. Looking out the window the snow was still falling over the castle grounds, and down there I could see Makayla and Araya playing in the snow together making snow angels, snowmen and what not. My thoughts were interrupted by a soft knocking on the door and I walked away from the window and opened one of the double doors. \"Good morning,\" Troy smiled standing there with two cups of tea on a tray. \"Good morning,\" I giggled my gaze landed on the tray. \"Care to explain?\" I simply questioned stepping aside. He walked into the room and put the tray down on the table as I sat down in one of the two plush chairs. \"Well I thought that you wanted to enjoy a quiet morning for once,\" he told me and handed me one of the two cups. I nodded accepting it, smelling the sweet tea. \"I guess I do, but didn\\'t your mom talk about this huge family breakfast?\" I questioned a little puzzled. \"Brunch,\" Troy stated taking a sip of the tea. \"But that wasn\\'t until noon which is in an hour. It is just that…\" he said trailing off and I frowned a little, leaning more towards him. \"Did something bad happen?\" I asked uneasily looking at him \"Not exactly but something did happen.\" He paused for a moment leaning back in the chair thinking about the event, but he didn\\'t meet my gaze. \"There is a reason why Makayla and Araya is outside at the moment,\" he started explaining to me. \"I came in the middle of it so I don\\'t know what happened but Calvin was arguing with his parents and Kathleen about something. I didn\\'t want to get in the middle of it so I left to see if you were awake,\" he explained to me and I was confused. \"Does he usually argue with his parents because he doesn\\'t strike me as that type.\" \"Your right, he doesn\\'t. Therefore, it is a little unusual but it\\'s probably best if we stay out of it,\" Troy advised me and I nodded before drinking the last sip of my tea. \"Should we head down and see if there is brunch soon? I am starving,\" I proclaimed and Troy smiled as he put his cup on the tray. \"I can carry it,\" I told him picking it up with ease. \"Ok,\" he agreed and we walked out of the room. Troy closed the door behind us and as I turned to look at him I noticed a stocking hanging on the door handle. It was red and white at the top. It was decorated with a snowman complete with a top hat, carrot and scarf. \"What is that?\" I questioned and frowned a little. \"You do have Christmas stockings in America? The one that Santa Clause fills with candy?\" he uttered in some state of shock. \"We do,\" I clarified at once and he breathed out, laughing a little. \"but I just didn\\'t expect it. Like this I guess…\" \"Like this?\" he questioned surprised with a small chuckle. \"On the door handle. We usually hang it on the fireplace.\" Glancing towards his door, a blue stocking with a red Santa hung there. \"Who did all of this?\" I questioned with a wide grin like I was a five-year-old. \"Santa of course!\" he stated and I burst out laughing. \"Did everyone get one?\" I questioned as we started walking towards the kitchen I presumed. \"Only us five kids.\" As we reached the kitchen he opened the door for me and inside Lucille and Alexander were doing what looked to be the finishing touches on the brunch. \"Good morning. Did you sleep well?\" Alexander greeted us following me with his warm gaze as I put the tray down by the sink. \"Good morning and yes I did. This smells wonderful,\" I said looking at the various dishes that were placed around the kitchen while Troy was casually leaning against the counter. \"I am glad to hear that but I have to say that Lucille is the one who has made most of the food,\" Alexander confessed and Lucille chuckled turning off the stove. \"I did not and you know it,\" Lucille said good-natured looking at the three of us. \"If the two of you would be so kind and take a dish up to the dining room?\" Alexander asked grabbing a dish before leading the way. Troy and I each grabbed one and followed Alexander and Lucille to the dining room where everyone appeared to be except Araya and Makayla. \"I will go and get Makayla and Araya,\" Ben said and walked out of the room after he saw us arrive with the food. \"Is there more food down in the kitchen that you need help with?\" Amelia questioned Lucille as she put down a bowl on the table. \"No, me and Alex will manage the last two. Makayla and Araya are on their way?\" she questioned and Bridget nodded. \"Ben just walked out to get them.\" \"Wonderful,\" Lucille smiled and Alexander joined her to go back to the kitchen. I took a glance around the room and saw Jack, Keith and Hendric engaged in a conversation. Calvin sat in a chair close by Adriana, Kathleen and Gael but it didn\\'t look like he was paying attention to the conversation they had. Judging by his facial expression he almost looked unhappy. \"Wait for me!\" we heard a voice shout followed by rapid footsteps. Through the doors, Araya came running with Makayla following close by. \"Don\\'t run!\" both Bridget and Adrianna scolded the two girls. \"Sorry mom,\" Makayla apologized while Araya walked over to Bridget who picked her up and placed Araya on her lap. \"I hope people are hungry because there is plenty of food,\" Alexander said as he and Lucille placed the last two dishes on the table. 14:30/2:30pm Troy and I were sitting on the couch in his room. My head was leaning on his shoulder while his left hand was wrapped around my shoulder. Both of us eating some of the candy we got in our stockings. \"Troy?\" I questioned, my voice barely above a whisper. \"Mhm,\" he answered looking at me. \"Is everyone staying until New Year\\'s Eve?\" I asked but he shook his head. \"No they don\\'t. They usually leave a couple of days before. What about it?\" he wondered and I sat up. \"Nothing, I was just wondering,\" I lied but the look he gave me showed that he didn\\'t believe it. \"Is it too much?\" he questioned taking my hands and I nodded slowly. \"Your family is wonderful and they have been so nice, but it\\'s just a little much with fifteen people I don\\'t know and being so far away from my mom during the holidays,\" I explained to him and my lip quivered a little. \"It\\'s just overwhelming,\" I confessed and I felt a couple of tears that feel down my cheek. Troy used his thumb to wipe them away and he opened his arms to give me a hug. I scooted closer and he wrapped his arms around me kissing my temple. \"Do you just want to be left alone for some time or do you need to get out of the house?\" \"I love spending time with you and the proposition of getting out of the house sounds appealing,\" I told him without hesitation. \"I know something we can do that I always found entertaining. You don\\'t mind being outside now do you?\" he questioned a little uncertain. \"Not at all if it means that we could get out of the house,\" I said to him. \"Let\\'s go then. Dress warm,\" he told me and I hurried into my room to change. \"Here you could need these,\" Troy said handing me a pair of warm gloves as we walked outside about half an hour later. \"Thank you,\" I said grateful and took my hands out of the jacket before putting on the gloves. \"I have a hunch we\\'re going riding?\" I said to him as he pushed open the stable door. \"You\\'re correct. I have always enjoyed it and I am hoping you will like it as well,\" he said to me and I smiled as we walked over towards Domino. \"I\\'m not going by myself? Am I?\" I questioned worriedly. \"No, not the first time and not where we\\'re heading. Maybe during the summer in a closed area,\" he explained to me. \"So,\" he started and stopped by Domino\\'s box. \"The easiest thing would probably just be doing it bareback,\" he said and petted Domino\\'s muzzle as she pushed it against his shoulder. \"Ey,\" he laughed. \"What does that mean?\" I questioned confused. \"It means that we\\'re riding without a saddle. It\\'s the easiest since we\\'re two people and I trust her enough to do it,\" he explained to me. \"Now there are really two things we need is the bridle and helmet,\" he said and made a quick process of finding the items. He made sure that the helmet was securely fastened before he put the bridle on Domino. I was fascinated how she just stood there while Troy secured all the various straps. Troy took reins in front of Domino and lead her out of the stable as I closed the door behind them. Outside in the snow, Troy pushed the reins back over Dominos head and let them go turning towards me. \"We\\'re going to take it slow until you feel comfortable ok? Are you ready?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"I\\'m ready.\" Troy gave me a smile before he turned towards Domino and stood on her left side. He grabbed some of her mane before he took two steps, put a hand on her back and swung his leg over the horse. \"Good girl,\" he praised her brushing his hand up and down her neck. \"How long did it take you to learn that?\" I questioned him amazed. \"Longer than I would like to admit,\" he laughed. \"How am I going to get up?\" \"Take my hand and step on my foot. As you hoist yourself up grab my right shoulder so you don\\'t lose your balance,\" he instructed. \"All right,\" I nodded and he offered me his hand. \"Sure I won\\'t hurt you with the cast?\" I asked a little sceptical but he nodded. \"I\\'m sure.\" I took his hand and did as he instructed and I managed to swing my leg over the horse. \"I did it!\" I cheered, to Troy\\'s amusement, as I sat on top of the horse. \"Are you ready?\" \"Ok,\" I said my voice a little shaky. \"Just wrap your hands around me so you don\\'t fall off,\" he instructed and not long after Domino started walking. \"How are you doing?\" he asked me after some time. \"Great. I can see why you enjoy this so much,\" I told him as Domino neighed. \"Easy Domino,\" Troy said to the horse. \"She has too much energy,\" I stated. \"Yeah that\\'s common for Arabian horses. How did you know?\" he questioned surprised. \"I guess I just sensed it somehow. I don\\'t mind going a little faster.\" \"You don\\'t have to just because of her.\" \"I know that but I truly want to,\" I said to him. \"All right. Hang on,\" he said and I could hear the excitement in his voice. He made a noise with his mouth, almost like a clicking sound, and it felt like Domino almost started running. I held onto Troy but laughed as the wind blew past us as we headed towards somewhere. We had been riding for quite some time before Troy slowed Domino down to a walk. \"We\\'re here,\" Troy announced and I looked over his shoulder. \"Wow!\" I breathed as I saw the view. We were overlooking snow covered mountains and a beautiful frozen lake way down in the valley. \"This is beautiful.\" Troy got off the horse before lifting me off. \"Thank you,\" I smiled and Troy bound Domino to a nearby tree. \"It\\'s beautiful here. And so quiet,\" I said to him as he wrapped an arm around my waist. \"Yeah it\\'s a great place to come to just think or being alone,\" he said to me and I could easily understand why. I leaned my head on his shoulder and he kissed the top of my head. 17:32/5:32pm \"I think I needed to get out of the house. It was good to get away from everyone even though I like your family it was just a little much,\" I told Troy feeling much more relaxed now. There was a bench there, that we had brushed the snow off, and we had been sitting there talking for quite a while. \"Better than being along in Albuquerque?\" he wondered and I nodded. \"Absolutely.\" Troy leaned his head closer to mine and I gazed into his eyes. He leaned in closer and our lips connected into a romantic kiss. The wind around us picked up and started whirling the snow around as I broke the kiss. I wrapped my arms more around myself and Troy brought me even closer towards him. \"I believe we should head back soon. I don\\'t like the colour of the skies approaching,\" he said and I looked over at the lake. He was right because the skies were awfully dark. \"Will there come even more snow?\" I questioned already amazed by the amount that had already fallen. \"Most likely and by the looks of it there could even be a storm,\" he told me as we made our way back towards Domino. \"A snow storm?\" I questioned in disbelief. \"Mhm. They are a lot like a normal storm with rain and thunder, but it is snowing instead,\" he told me and removed the rope that he used to secure Domino. \"A… Are you sure we will make it back on time?\" I questioned doubtfully as he mounted Domino. \"Yeah. It doesn\\'t look like it will hit for at least half an hour,\" he tried to assure me as he helped me up onto the horse, the same way he did back at the stable. As I had wrapped my arms around his torso, Domino was quick to pick up the pace she had on the last bit of our trip, but of course not until Troy had instructed her to do so. 17:47/5:47pm I leaned my head against Troy\\'s back really enjoying the trip. To be honest I hadn\\'t expected to enjoy riding as much as I did. Peering over his shoulder I saw as we were almost at the stable. As he stopped in front of the building he got off and once again lifted me off. \"Thank you,\" I said gratefully. \"Do you want to go inside now or do you mind waiting a couple of minutes?\" he questioned looking at me. \"I don\\'t mind waiting a couple of minutes. What about it?\" I asked curiously. \"Just wanted to take a couple of laps with Domino so she doesn\\'t get restless,\" he explained to me. \"After the trip we just had?\" I said to him a little surprised. \"Mhm,\" he nodded. \"It wasn\\'t that long and she stood still for quite some time,\" he reasoned and I nodded. He grabbed the reins of Domino and lead her into a large fenced off area just by the stable. There he got onto Domino again as I took off my helmet and sat down on the fence watching. I was fascinated by watching them and my heart raced a little faster when they went even faster that we had gone earlier. As they neared where I sat during their third lap Troy sat up straighter than he had done earlier and he pulled the reins towards him. Then Domino neighed and time slowed down as it felt like my heart would stop. Troy was thrown off Domino and he landed in the snow with a low thud as Domino ran a couple of yards away before she stopped. Somehow I had a feeling she had been spooked. \"Troy,\" I called out to him scared, my voice a little hoarse. I hopped down from the fence as the helmet landed in the snow and hurried towards him. \"Troy!\" I called out again my voice even more panicked. \"Are you all right?\" I questioned as I saw that he was sitting. \"I am all right,\" he reassured me and rose to his feet brushing some snow off himself. \"Things like this happen which is why we have helmets,\" he assured me stroking my cheek. I breathed out in relief as he walked over towards Domino and stroke her muzzle before he mounted her once again. I watched as the two of them made their way towards me and Troy got down, grabbing her reins. \"Good girl,\" he said petting her. Troy put Domino back in her box and made sure she had all that she needed before we left the stable. \"Are you sure you\\'re all right?\" I asked him anxiously taking his hand as we were on our way towards the castle. \"I\\'m sure,\" he told me confidently. \"It doesn\\'t hurt anywhere; besides it is bound to happen when you\\'re riding. This just means I have some work to do during the summer before college,\" he assured me and we walked inside the castle just as the snow started falling heavily and the wind picked up. Dinner with his family was much more enjoyable than I had thought after the events this morning. Everyone was talking to everyone and laughter was heard around the table. Whatever tension that had been there during the morning appeared to be gone. After several hours I excused myself claiming to be tired and headed towards my bedroom. Troy\\'s POV It was almost midnight and I had just been down in the kitchen to check on Misty and her kittens. They looked to be in great shape and had become more and more curious about their surroundings each day. Walking past a window I saw the snow falling heavily outside and the sound of thunder was heard in the distance. \"How has it been with Troy in America?\" I heard grandma Kathleen question my mom. The sound was coming from the living room and I noticed that the door was slightly open. \"It has been different but every time I talk to him, he really sounds like he is enjoying himself there. Now, Jack was not all that excited about the idea when Troy came and asked us,\" mom replied with a small sigh. \"Really? How come?\" Adrianna wondered her voice held surprise. \"I do not know the exact reason because he did not share that, but it was pretty clear that he was not all too happy when Troy asked us. I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity for him to get some friends and just be himself without all the pressure of the public. To be honest, I do not know he would have left if it had not been mentioned to Amelia and Alexander,\" mom told the others and I was genuinely surprised. To me, it had appeared that dad was supporting in the decision and to hear that he really wasn\\'t hurt me. \"What does Amelia and Alexander have to do with this?\" grandma questioned surprised and I took a quick glance around the hallway but no one was coming. \"They heard Jack and I talk one afternoon and was wondering what it was about. When we told them about Troy\\'s request they were overjoyed and thought it was a wonderful opportunity for him, which I believe lead Jack to agree, even though he was not too happy about the decision. However, we decided that it would be for the best if he did not say who he was,\" mom told them and a small lump was beginning to form in my throat and tears were burning in the back of my eyes. \"If Jack wasn\\'t happy about Troy going to America how did he react when Troy told you about his girlfriend?\" Violet questioned uncertainly. \"Well you could imagine Jack was not overjoyed because he believed that Troy should focus on his studies but he came around eventually,\" mom told them with a sigh. \"When I told Jack that Troy and Gabriella had broken up after Troy had told her his secret you could only imagine how he was. We had a long discussion if he should continue after Christmas at all. Eventually, I managed to persuade him that Troy should finish the year and that it was normal,\" mom told them and I heard Kathleen scoff. \"Normal. A secret like that could ruin any friendship.\" \"So when Gabriella was invited for Christmas?\" Adrianna questioned uncertainly avoiding another dispute. \"It was mostly me, Amelia and Alexander wanting to meet her but I think Jack also wanted to meet her, even though he did not specifically express it. It was unfortunate that her mother could not be here, but according to Troy, Gabriella was overjoyed about the opportunity,\" mom told them and I knew she was smiling at this point. \"She seems like a lovely girl,\" Kathleen commented. \"Do you know how they meet?\" she questioned and my mother started explaining. I didn\\'t pay much attention to what she said because I was still stumped by the fact that my father didn\\'t approve much about two of the biggest decisions I had made recently and he didn\\'t want me to come back to America. After a minute or so I walked down the hallway and towards my bedroom suddenly feeling exhausted. I was just sitting in my bed thinking about everything that I had just heard when a knock was sounded. \"Come in,\" I called thinking it might be Brie. A little surprised, my mom walked into the room. \"Hi, are you all right?\" she questioned sitting down on the bed beside me. \"Yeah,\" I nodded scooting closer to her. \"You sure?\" she questioned me again and I sighed in defeat. \"I… I do not know,\" I told her honestly and she wrapped an arm around me comfortingly. \"You heard us talk?\" she questioned and I nodded as there was no point in lying now. \"The door was open and I just heard you talk and when you mentioned me going to America and Gabriella,\" I confessed and leaned my head on her shoulder as she rubbed my shoulder. \"Is it really true about dad?\" I questioned quietly and mom let out a breath. \"It is,\" she clarified and we sat there in silence. \"All of it?\" I clarified looking at her as she nodded. \"I am sorry Troy.\" \"There is something I should have told you a couple of days ago,\" I started after several minutes of silence. \"Ok,\" she said calmly waiting for an explanation. \"Gabriella and I found Misty in the barn the other day but she had given birth to eight kittens. We thought it was too cold in the stable so we put them in a box in the second kitchen. Maggie bought some food here the other day too,\" I confessed looking at my mom… who was smiling? \"Well you should have come earlier but what is done, is done and you did the right thing,\" she said to me before continuing. \"Why do not we go down there in the morning and see what we could do?\" she asked and I nodded. \"Calvin and Makayla also know,\" I said shortly but mom didn\\'t seem surprised. \"I figured you would tell them,\" she smiled. \"Now you have had a long day so why do not you get a good night sleep?\" mom questioned and I smiled sheepishly. \"Maybe we were out a little longer than intended,\" I said and mom laughed standing up. \"Good night Troy,\" mom said giving me a hug. \"Good night mom,\" I smiled as she walked out of the room closing the door behind her. That was it! What do you think? A review is hugely appreciated. Until next time -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 17] ['Thank you so much to LabyrinthsDavidBowieWildcats30, Pumkingking 5 and especially Grace for being my 30 th review. Thank you so much you all are amazing! I have gotten several questions about what is going on between Calvin and Gabriella, but also the fight he is having with his parents/relatives and I swear it will be revealed in later chapters. Sorry this was meant to be up a couple of days ago but I couldn\\'t upload the chapter into doc manager but I saw that several people had that issue but now it seems to be fixed. Hope you all enjoy it! Thursday December 27 th Gabriella\\'s POV I woke up with a jolt as there was a flash seen through the room followed by a loud rumbling. I turned and looked at the clock seeing it was just after one in the night. The snow was hitting hard against the large windows as another flash and rumbling came. Pulling the covers up to cover my head my heartrate increasing each time the loud rumbling was heard. Turning around once again I gave up trying to get back to sleep. It was rather silly being seventeen and afraid of the thunder. I picked up my duvet and quietly walked out of my room and to the left. Standing outside of his door, I knocked softly a couple of times before I opened it and silently walked inside. As I closed the door and turned around I watched as Troy sat up in his bed rubbing sleep out of his eye. \"Hi couldn\\'t sleep?\" he questioned as I crawled into the bed beside him. \"Mhm,\" I said and another bang was heard as I flinched. \"And you\\'re scared of the thunder,\" he stated and I nodded scooting closer towards him. \"I\\'m glad you woke me up,\" Troy told me and I pulled my duvet on top of the one Troy pulled over us. \"Is it that cold?\" he almost mumbled and I rested my head on his chest. \"I\\'m not used to this cold,\" I claimed and Troy kissed the top of my head. \"I\\'m just teasing Brie. Goodnight, sleep tight,\" he said and I smiled. \"Goodnight,\" I said as he loosely rested his left arm around my waist. The thunder was still raging outside but now it didn\\'t matter because Troy was there. Hence, I was asleep after a couple of minutes. I slowly opened my eyes as I noticed someone shaking my shoulder repeating my name. \"Mhm?\" I questioned looking into the eyes of Troy. \"We have to get up. It is almost twelve thirty,\" he said and my eyes widened in shock. \"What?\" I questioned sitting up. \"Have we really slept for that long?\" I questioned in disbelief as Troy nodded. \"We have,\" he confirmed and laughed a little. \"Mom actually woke me up ten minutes ago,\" he told me and I was still shocked. \"She was in here?\" I asked in disbelief. \"She would have said something to me if she had a problem with it,\" he reassured me and I nodded. \"I\\'ll wait on you and we can go eat together,\" he told me as I wrapped the duvet around me before walking back to my room. XOXO Lucille\\'s POV \"Where is Troy and Gabriella? I have not seen either of them this morning,\" Jack questioned as we were preparing breakfast in the kitchen. \"They are both asleep,\" I said to him and he looked at me raising an eyebrow and I sighed putting the spatula down on the counter. \"I was going to wake him up because Adrianna told me yesterday that they were thinking about leaving sometime today, but as I knocked on the door there were no answer so I presumed he was sleeping. When I peeked inside both of them were asleep and I believe that they were up late because of the thunder,\" I explained to my husband. The kettle that stood on the stove started whistling and Jack turned his attention to it. \"So everyone else is up?\" he questioned pouring the water into the pot with tea. \"I believe they are. I have seen most of them except my parents,\" I told him turning off the stove putting the egg in a bowl. \"That was the last thing,\" I said and Jack took the pot as we carried everything up. XOXO Gabriella\\'s POV Troy and I were sitting by the counter down in the kitchen eating breakfast when Calvin came down. \"Good morning,\" he said shortly walking over to the fridge grabbing a drink. \"Morning,\" Troy and I greeted him. \"Why didn\\'t you turn up for breakfast?\" he questioned turning towards us, opening the bottle. \"Slept in,\" Troy said simply shrugging his shoulders as he continued to eat. \"I\\'m surprised aunt Lucille didn\\'t wake you up earlier,\" he commented shrugging his shoulders and I got a creeping feeling up my back. Not the good one. \"Oh. Why is that?\" Troy simply questioned him. \"We\\'re leaving sometime today. I though you would have heard,\" he said and I had a slight guilt that I felt relieved. I really liked Makayla but not her brother. Why did twins have to be so opposite? As Troy and I made our way towards the main living room we meet Makayla with a bag over her shoulder. \"You\\'re leaving?\" I questioned and she nodded. \"Yeah. I thought you didn\\'t know,\" she commented looking at the two of us. \"Calvin told us a couple of minutes ago. He was down in the kitchen while we were eating breakfast,\" Troy told her and Makayla made a shocked expression turning more towards me. \"You made breakfast here?\" she exclaimed and Troy laughed as I must have had a shocked face. \"Haha,\" he mocked. \"I have been living alone for half a year,\" he said and Makayla were laughing. \"I\\'m just messing with you. I don\\'t doubt you\\'re managing on your own. Anyways, I have go pack up some last minute stuff. I will see you later,\" she said and gave us a small wave before skipping down the hallway. Continuing down we saw his mom coming. \"Good morning,\" she smiled at the two of us. \"Good morning,\" we both greeted her. \"Have you seen Calvin or Makayla today?\" she questioned. \"We have seen both of them,\" Troy confirmed with a nod. \"Did they tell you they are leaving within the hour?\" she questioned and Troy nodded again. \"Yes Makayla told just a couple of minutes ago,\" he confirmed. \"All right I will see you later,\" she said and we walked our separate ways. XOXO \"It was so nice meeting you,\" I said to Makayla giving her a hug. \"You too,\" she said and smiled at me. \"Hopefully we can meet again or at least keep in contact,\" she told me. \"Yes I would really like that,\" I smiled at her. I looked over as Calvin was saying goodbye to Troy and his parents. \"You kids ready?\" Gael asked and Makayla nodded. \"Goodbye,\" the all said and the four of them walked out the castle\\'s front doors. A faint cry was heard and Ben came with a crying Araya. \"Did Gael and Adrianna leave?\" he asked bouncing slightly with Araya on his shoulder. \"They just left,\" Lucille informed looking at Araya. \"Is she not well?\" she questioned Ben. \"No she is just about to spike a fever so Bridget and I were thinking about leaving a little earlier,\" he informed them. \"Poor thing,\" Alexander said sympathetically looking at her. XOXO An hour later and Bridgett, Ben and Araya had just left. Violet and Hendric had also left shortly after them. Now it was only Kathleen, Keith, Troy\\'s family and me left. The whole atmosphere of the castle had changed and become more quiet. It almost felt like there was an echo in the halls when we walked down them. \"Is it this quiet all year round?\" I asked looking up at him. \"Only during Christmas and New Year\\'s eve. Normally the people working here are going around doing their job, there are some security people doing rounds and tour guides giving tours to the tourists. \"So it is actually quite nosy?\" I asked and he nodded. \"But I don\\'t mind that. I just have to think about where I go during the summer so I don\\'t want to get in the path of the tourists. Too much attention,\" he said shrugging. \"It is so surreal to be here and imagine everyone wanting to take your picture,\" I said to him. \"I guess you get used to it,\" he told me shrugging. XOXO That afternoon I was sitting on Facebook talking to Taylor. \"How is Etrea?\" she wrote to me. \"I really like it. There is so much snow here and it just looks like some fairy-tale winter wonderland,\" I wrote back. \"How was it meeting Troy\\'s family?\" \"It was great. Most of them were nice, but his cousin didn\\'t seem to like me, but his sister was so opposite and we got along great. She told me about some traditions they had and gave me information about the parade that was shown on TV that the royal family attended,\" I wrote. \"Why didn\\'t Troy tell you that stuff?\" she questioned and I had to think of a lie. Quickly. \"He was just busy helping his mother.\" \"How many were there celebrating Christmas?\" \"We were seventeen people. Many of them were from Lucille\\'s family. Now it is only Troy, his parents plus grandparents and his grandparents on his mother\\'s side.\" I wrote back to her. \"Wow, that\\'s a crowd. So I imagine it is quieter now?\" she questioned. \"Yes. I really liked his family but it was nice to be just him and his family. How was your Christmas?\" I questioned and she started telling about her Christmas. XOXO I was turning and tossing in my bed not getting any sleep. I rolled over once again looking at the clock. 03:30. This was the first Christmas I had celebrated without any of my parents, and I were starting to really miss my mom. Grabbing my phone from the nightstand I opened it and scrolled through my contacts finding my mom\\'s number. My thumb hovered over the green call button before I pressed it and put the phone to my ear hearing the ringing tone. \"Hello Gabriella,\" mom\\'s cheerful voice was sounded. \"Hi mom. Merry Christmas,\" I said and smiled to myself. \"Merry Christmas mi hija.\" \"Are you busy?\" I questioned and her voice almost sounded surprised. \"No I\\'m on my lunch break now. It\\'s one thirty here,\" she explained. \"What\\'s wrong. Are you regretting your decision?\" she questioned and I sniffed a little. \"No,\" I told her my voice quivering. \"I am just missing you and dad,\" I explained to mom. \"Oh hija. I miss you too. What time is it over there?\" she asked me and I looked at the clock once more. \"Just after three thirty in the night,\" I said and mom laughed a little. \"Oh Gabriella. Shouldn\\'t you be asleep?\" she questioned and I laughed. \"I guess…\" I trailed off. \"How has your Christmas been so far?\" she questioned and I smiled to myself. \"Great. Troy\\'s grandparent was really nice and welcoming and I really got along with his cousin Makayla. She told me a lot of interesting facts while we were watching this Christmas parade here the other day. Troy and I were actually out riding here the other day and it was so fun. He showed me this beautiful outlook point and we just sat there for a couple of hours. We were seventeen on Christmas eve but now it is only Troy\\'s grandparents on his mother side left. Everyone else left earlier today. How has your Christmas been?\" I told her. \"Sounds like quite an eventful Christmas then. Mine has been rather boring to be honest. Unfortunately, the meeting lasted longer than expected so I am not flying home until late on the 29th. Have you and Troy talked about when you are returning?\" she asked. \"No, but he told me before we left that we wouldn\\'t be home later than Friday the fourth,\" I explained to her and smiled to myself \"I have to go hija but enjoy the rest of your vacation and we\\'ll see each other in a week all right?\" mom said and I nodded. \"Ok mom. I love you.\" \"Te amo mi hija,\" mom said and we ended the phone call. Still feeling restless, I found my laptop and googled Royal College of Etrea and started reading about application rules. Their due date was February 1st for all applications and they accepted students from every country. I clicked on the admission tab and started reading. \"Nationality. American,\" I said quietly to myself and clicked on it. \"Age, seventeen. Name, Gabriella Montez.\" I filled out. That was it! What do you all think?

Thank you so much for your encouraging words you both keep me going! Thank you to everyone who is favouriting/following the story/me, you are awsome! Enjoy! Still feeling restless, I found my laptop and googled Royal College of Etrea and started reading about application rules. Their due date was February 1 st for all applications and they accepted students from every country. I clicked on the admission tab and started reading. \"Nationality. American,\" I said quietly to myself and clicked on it. \"Age, seventeen. Name, Gabriella Montez.\" I filled out. Monday December 31 st Gabriella\\'s POV For the past couple of days, it has been quiet around the castle. Troy and I had been spending most of our time together and here the other day we went riding again. This time he showed me another outlook point but over the city instead. Tonight it was New Year\\'s eve and we were celebrating it with Alexander, Amelia, Jack, Lucille, Kathleen and Keith. I was currently in my room brushing my hair after the shower and I thought back to the story Troy had shared with me earlier in the day. They used to celebrate the holiday with Marcus and his parents and as I have understood Marcus was also an only child. The tradition had however stopped as they had to move away. What puzzled me about this, was that Marcus\\'s father worked in some sort of government that Alexander ruled, which were based here in Iwaki. His father couldn\\'t possibly commute every day could he? Putting my brush down on the counter I walked over to my bed and picked up the red dress and put it on. It was a rather flowy dress that were fitted until just above the waist before it flared out and stopped at my knees. The dress had straps, but otherwise it was sleeveless. Knowing it was cold, I put on a pair of black wool stockings and a denim jacket. The last thing I added was the necklace Troy had given me for Christmas. I didn\\'t know why, but I started feeling giddy about the evening. There was a soft knock on the door and I walked over, opening with a smile. Outside Troy stood dressed in grey trousers with a matching jacket and light blue shirt. \"Hey,\" he said looking at me. \"Wow you look great,\" he told me smiling. \"Thank you, you look handsome,\" I told him with a smile of my own. \"So are you ready to head down for the celebration?\" he questioned and I nodded stepping out of my room, closing the door behind me. \"More than ready,\" I told him confidently and together we walked towards the dining room. \"So I have a question,\" I stated looking at him. \"Ok,\" he nodded. \"You told me how you used to celebrate new year\\'s eve with Marcus and his family but it all stopped once he moved away,\" I stated and he nodded. \"But didn\\'t you also say that his dad was in some sort of government? And isn\\'t Etrea a monarchy?\" I questioned puzzled and Troy smiled clearly amused. \"Yes his dad is in the council and yes Etrea is a monarchy,\" he said and I was still just as confused. \"Let me explain. Etrea is an absolute monarchy were the king holds all the power of the country, but at the same time a hereditary monarchy which means that the throne is passed down to the next member of the royal family,\" he said and I was confused. \"So,\" he continued going into greater detail. \"when I take the throne after my father, the task of running everything is too big for just me. Therefore, it is normal to select people to run sectors like military, security, health, education and stuff like that. There are twelve different spots to fill and the king chooses who he thinks are the best fit. Then each of those twelve people talk to their groups again working on projects or ideas they have been assigned and every week or every other week they gather in meetings and the king ultimately approves or rejects the ideas,\" he explained. \"So as your grandfather is running the country what does your grandmother and the rest of you do?\" \"Sobo is helping my grandfather with different tasks such as running the culture post and to some extent foreign affairs. Both mom and dad is sitting in on the meetings that is held with the council and learning how the meeting are. I have been to a couple of them and it really isn\\'t all that fun. The best part would be that we get to travel and see different parts of the wold learning about the different cultures,\" he told me and it all seemed so fascinating. \"Do you think a lot about the fact that you\\'re going to run a country in the future?\" I wondered and his whole face expression changed. \"Sometimes but more and more in the past couple of months,\" he admitted and I felt relieved that I hadn\\'t said something hurtful. \"Oh?\" I questioned puzzled and he just nodded. \"The teachers are all talking about college applications and deadlines and I know that I have already been accepted into Royal College of Etrea since the day I was born. Marcus for an example is automatically accepted but he has to send in an application never the less. I guess I am a little jealous that he is not tied down to study anything, but he knows that he is accepted into one of the top schools. Whereas for me, I could potentially study what I want but there will be a hell coming with it,\" he said and I couldn\\'t comprehend the information as I was shocked that Troy had just swore. \"I\\'m sorry,\" I told him quietly as my shock had worn off. He stopped abruptly looking at me his whole face expression softened. \"Don\\'t be,\" he told me shaking his head slightly. \"You had no way of knowing and it is rather special for someone living abroad and especially in America. Even people living in Australia and Japan have a hard time grasping this idea,\" he told me and I nodded feeling better. As we walked into the more formal dining room we were hit with the wonderful smell of food and the only thing it reminded me off was my mom\\'s turkey. \"Happy new year,\" Alexander greeted us with a smile as he saw us. \"Happy new year,\" we both told him. I was just fascinated by the looks of the room. The ceiling was high and circular curved with a chandelier in the middle. The walls were white at the bottom and above a light blue colour with golden details beautifully painted all over the walls. The floor had to be some sort of white marble with black details creating a beautiful pattern. \"Lucille and Amelia just went down to check on dinner,\" Alexander informed us as the door opened and Jack walked inside along with Keith and Kathleen. \"Happy new year,\" Kathleen said with a smile. Her dark brown hair was down and stopped at her shoulders where she was wearing a dark green top with a shawl covering her shoulders and a long fitted black skirt. \"Happy new year,\" we all echoed and I just stood there soaking up the moment. \"Why don\\'t we all take a seat and I believe dinner should be ready any minute?\" Alexander announced and we all sat down. Alexander started opening a wine bottle and poured for all the adults who were seated. \"Do you want some Gabriella?\" Alexander asked catching me off guard. For a split second I was shocked but then my mind caught up. Legal drinking age here were sixteen. \"No thank you,\" I denied politely. \"Troy?\" \"No thanks,\" he denied as well. Troy poured some soda for each of us as Lucille and Amelia entered the room with the dinner. \"Oh this smells heavenly,\" Kathleen told them as they put it down on the table. \"I hope it tastes as good as it looks. Courtesy of Gabriella\\'s recipe book,\" Amelia said and I could feel myself blush a little. Looking at everyone around the dining table I noticed how Alexander were the only one wearing a black tux from the speech he gave earlier in the day, but Jack and Keith were both wearing a suit. Lucille was wearing a black lace top with a blue suit jacket over and a pair of black pants. Amelia was wearing a dark crimson coloured long sleeved dress. As everyone had served themselves and I took the first bite it was just as good as what my mom made. \"This tastes delicious,\" I told Lucille and Amelia and both of them smiled. \"It indeed does,\" Kathleen agreed. \"That is lovely to hear and I do have to agree,\" Amelia said and we all continued to talk and laugh throughout the meal. \"Here, I brought some alcohol-free champagne,\" Troy told me handing over a glass. \"Thank you,\" I said accepting it taking a sip before looking over at Iwaki. Troy and I were standing outside on one of the many balconies overlooking Iwaki. It was beautiful with all the lights from the houses and downtown Iwaki where there was a huge gathering, much the same as the one on Time Square in New York after what I had understood. \"Ten… Nine…\" we heard the countdown start and Troy took my hand. \"To a great new year,\" he smiled looking at me lovingly. \"To a great new year,\" I replied. \"Five… four…\" the chanting continued and before I knew it, Troy leaned in to kiss me tenderly. \"One… Happy new year!\" we heard people cheer before it was drowned by the sound of the firework being shot up. \"Happy new year Brie,\" he told me and I felt a warmth spread through me after the kiss. \"Happy new year Troy,\" I smiled and we each clinked our glasses lightly before taking a sip, both missing the smile that both Lucille and Amelia had as they had watched us from the balcony above. I rested my head on Troy\\'s shoulder and his arm was wrapped around my waist as we were watching to fireworks light up the sky. \"Thank you for everything Troy. This has been a wonderful Christmas and new year\\'s eve,\" I told him and he smiled looking down at me. \"I am glad to hear that. I must admit I was a little apprehensive with my whole family and how you would all get along. I was surprised about how well you and Makayla got along especially,\" he told me honestly and I nodded. \"I was surprised too. Oh and by the way, she sent me a friend request on Facebook and she told me that they were going to adopt two of Misty\\'s kittens once they were old enough,\" I informed him. \"That is great news. I had a feeling Makayla fell head over heels in love with them,\" he said and I wrapped my hands more around myself. \"Are you cold?\" Troy questioned wrapping his arms around me and I felt warmer at once. \"A little. I\\'m not exactly used to these temperatures,\" I told him and he laughed softly. \"Let\\'s head inside,\" he proposed and we walked inside. A beep was heard from my jacket pocket and took out my cell phone to see a text from mom which I read. Happy new year hija! Hope you have a great time and I\\'ll see you in a couple of days. - Love mom I smiled to myself and quickly sent a reply wishing her a happy new year despite her not ringing in the new years for another sixteen hours. \"So I know we just started the new year but we have to think about when we are heading back. School starts again next Monday,\" he said with a sigh and I giggled. \"Yeah. I hoped before the weekend,\" I said to him and he nodded. \"I figured you wanted that so I thought about if we left early on the fourth we would be in Albuquerque the same day,\" he told me and I nodded. \"How early?\" I questioned. \"Probably be at the airport by six in the morning. If everything goes smoothly we could be in Albuquerque around four in the morning local time,\" he told me and I nodded. \"That is early but okay,\" I said as we joined his family once again to continue the celebrations.

Friday January 4 th 2008 04:30 Etrean time The alarm I had set the night before woke me up just after four thirty in the morning. A little reluctant I put my feet on the cold floor and got out of the bed, heading for the warmer bathroom, taking a hot shower. The snow globe I had gotten from Makayla was safely wrapped inside several layers of clothing to prevent it from breaking as I zipped my suitcase shut. There was a soft knock on the door and I walked over opening it. \"You are awake,\" Troy stated with a small smile and I nodded while trying to conceal a yawn. \"And tired. This is too early,\" I concluded yawning once more. \"Sorry,\" I muttered and he only smiled as I knew he was not a morning person himself. \"Are you hungry?\" he questioned but I shook my head. \"Not really,\" I told him casting a quick glance outside at the snow falling heavily. \"Nervous?\" he stated and I nodded. He knew me all too well by now. \"You don\\'t have anything to worry about. They wouldn\\'t fly if it wasn\\'t safe. Trust me,\" he reassured me and I was intrigued on how he knew that. \"Oh? It doesn\\'t have something to do about the fact that you\\'re the royal family,\" I joked but stopped once I saw the look on his face. \"My gosh, that is why!\" I exclaimed and I watched as he became a little uncomfortable. \"Yeah, they wouldn\\'t risk to end the only form of ruling system in Etrea. That would cause complete havoc,\" he explained and I was shocked. \"It still seems so surreal,\" I stated not meeting his eyes. \"What about it?\" he questioned wrapping me into his arms kissing me on the top of my head. I felt so relaxed and safe wrapped in his arms. I wished this feeling wouldn\\'t go away… \"The castle and your family,\" I stated looking up at him. \"I still have a hard time grasping the fact that you are going to become a king and eventually rule over all of this,\" I tried to explain and he nodded understandingly. \"I understand what you mean,\" he said but I cut him off. \"How?\" \"As I was growing up, until the age of six, I had no idea who I really was. Whenever my parents and grand-parents were traveling abroad they told me that it was work related which really wasn\\'t a lie,\" he reasoned with me before continuing. \"Before I started school my parents told me everything, but I still had a hard time grasping who I really was. I don\\'t think it was until after I meet Marcus that I really grasped and understood who I was. Even after that I understood why I got all the attention I did, but I still hated it,\" he explained to me and I had a much greater understanding of what he had experienced. \"I\\'m sorry for doubting you. I should have known,\" I mumbled but he shook his head. \"Don\\'t\\',\" he told me taking my hand. \"I didn\\'t expect you to know. The only other person who knew that story beside my family was Marcus,\" Troy explained and I had gained a greater understanding, while still having so many questions. \"What did you think when you had to have Ted with you as a kid?\" I questioned and he laughed thinking back to some memory he had. \"I didn\\'t think he was there because of me. I was just happy that I had him and Maggie as my parents were away,\" he shared and I had to smile. Despite who he was it truly sounded like Jack and Lucille tried to give him a normal childhood. As much as they were able to due to the circumstances. \"It is already ten past five, we should head downstairs and leave,\" he told me after looking at his watch. \"Yeah, we should\" I agreed still wrapped in his arms. I put my hands around his neck and stood up on my toes to give him a kiss on the lips. \"Love you too Brie,\" he said giving me another quick kiss before we grabbed our stuff and headed downstairs. I was surprised when I saw both Troy\\'s parents and grandparents waiting for us in the foyer. \"Are you leaving now?\" Amelia questioned looking at her grandson. \"Yes we are, so this is a goodbye for now,\" he said and gave both of them a hug before turning towards his parents. \"Thank you so much for letting me stay here. I had a wonderful time,\" I told Amelia who smiled softly at me. \"I am glad to hear that. It was wonderful to get to meet someone who has made Troy so happy,\" Amelia said and I knew I were blushing at this point but none of them said anything. \"If you ever find yourself in Etrea in the future we would love for you to come visit,\" Alexander said and I felt my heart soar with happiness. \"Thank you so much, I would love to visit you all again in the future,\" I told him honestly and Amelia wrapped me in a hug that I gladly returned. \"It was nice meeting the two of you,\" I told Lucille and Jack a little more nervous than I had been with Alexander and Amelia. \"It was a pleasure to meet you Gabriella and hopefully we will see each other in the future,\" she said and I just had to smile at her comment. \"I truly hope we will. Thank you for everything I had a wonderful time,\" I told them sincerely and Jack smiled at me. \"I am glad to hear that, I hope I will see you later,\" he said and I smiled nodding. \"I hope so too.\" I bid my last goodbyes before Troy and I left for the airport our hands intertwined. As the massive plane was climbing towards its cruising altitude I curled up in the seat with the last couple of chapters from my book. Looking up at the screen we were now over the North Pacific Ocean on our way towards Los Angeles and I softly closed the book putting it on the table in front of me. \"Troy?\" I questioned as I noticed he was looking at something on his phone. \"Hm?\" he questioned looking up at me. \"What is going to happen to the kittens?\" \"I spoke with mom and she was going to arrange for them to be adopted. Makayla was going to adopt two and Ted talked about adopting two,\" he explained. \"Wait, Ted as in your bodyguard?\" I questioned raising an eyebrow and he laughed a little. \"Yes that Ted,\" he stated obviously amused by my slight shock. \"That was nice of him,\" I stated with a slight smile and he nodded. \"Didn\\'t you say that he had two kids that were about your age?\" I asked and he nodded. \"Three actually but yes.\" Our conversation was interrupted by a flight attendant carrying two trays of food placing them in front of us before quietly walking away. \"Is it always like that? The awkwardness?\" \"That\\'s nothing compared to when my grandfather is in a meeting or something like that. Usually they don\\'t send the new one,\" he said with a smile and I smiled, despite having a hard time grasping how. Over the course of the holidays I had learned how Troy\\'s family really were and despite having the power over a country they were all so down to earth. After we had eaten breakfast I felt that I had been up early today and curled up to Troy before I fell asleep. Sadly, I didn\\'t sleep for long as I woke up to two voices talking quietly. Blinking a couple of times my gaze landed on Troy and Ted. As Ted saw me awake he nodded placing something face down on the table before walking away and Troy turned his head to look at me. \"Good morning,\" he said and I stretched my arms. \"Good morning. How long was I asleep?\" I wondered. \"Just about half an hour. Did we wake you up?\" he questioned concerned and I gave him a soft smile. \"I don\\'t think you did.\" \"Listen,\" he started and I frowned slightly, sitting up a little straighter. \"It\\'s something bad isn\\'t it?\" I asked but his facial expression was unreadable. \"Well…\" he started releasing a breath. \"It depends. You remember the first time we went out riding?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"I really didn\\'t want this to happen but somehow we were spotted,\" he explained and reached for what Ted had placed on the table earlier. It was a magazine. Dream Magazine the front read in some fancy font. The picture was of Troy and I sitting on the bench at the viewpoint kissing. Well, you couldn\\'t really see that it was me because, luckily, my back was against the photographer, but you could see that it was Troy. The text boxes on the side read stuff like: Exclusive! Only in Dream Magazine, has his Royal Highness Troy Bolton finally found someone? And Who is the mysterious lucky girl? \"Wow,\" was the only thing I managed to say completely stunned. I didn\\'t know how I felt. How did they know we were there at that moment? We didn\\'t see anyone on our way there, nor did we hear anything upon our arrival. It was all so blissful. I thought it was just the two of us. It should have just been the two of us… \"I am so sorry Gabriella.\" His voice brought me out of my thoughts. \"I never wanted this to happen and it shouldn\\'t have happened,\" he told me, his voice full of regret. \"Please don\\'t blame yourself. I know you never meant for this to happen but at the moment no harm done. It\\'s obvious that they don\\'t know who I am and now we are on our way back to America who\\'s halfway around the world,\" I explained to him. \"You are probably right but the thing is that they shouldn\\'t have been there in the first place. Can you promise me if it becomes a problem you will tell me at once?\" \"I promise Troy. Can I read what it says?\" I questioned curiously and he nodded. \"Of course,\" he said handing me the magazine. I quickly scanned the article, but it wasn\\'t that long nor did it contain as many pictures as the front cover suggested. \"Ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking,\" an announcement was heard and I grew nervous. The captain hadn\\'t spoken to us before, which meant that something bad was happening… \"We are experiencing some turbulence so please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts and it should be over soon. Thank you,\" he finished and the seatbelt sign above us flickered on. \"Brie,\" Troy\\'s soft voice brought me out of my thoughts. I looked at him and his face softened. \"You have your seatbelt on?\" he questioned and I had to look down to make sure I had. \"It\\'s going to be all right, it\\'s just some turbulence and we are safe all right?\" he soothed and I managed a small nod of my head. He wrapped his arm around my shoulder and brought me as close as he could. Luckily the turbulence didn\\'t last too long and the rest of the flight was rather uneventful, both of us sleeping a good portion of it. Before I knew it we had touched down in Los Angeles and were taxing towards the smaller airplane that would bring us back to Albuquerque. As we exited the plane this time around I noticed that only a handful of security guards were joining us on the last flight. As the last time, we took a seat in the back section of the plane and waited for it to take us up in the air and back to Albuquerque. \"Miss Montez?\" Ted addressed me and I looked at him as he was standing in the doorway. \"The driver was wondering if you needed to be dropped off somewhere after we land?\" he questioned and I was genuinely surprised and touched about the question. \"No thank you,\" I declined as politely as I could. \"I have made arrangements with my mother and I don\\'t wish to disturb her at this hour,\" I explained and he nodded with a smile. \"Of course,\" he said and walked away. \"That was nice,\" I said and Troy smiled knowingly. \"What?\" I questioned confused. \"I am sorry to be blunt, if that is what you say, but Ted is the one driving,\" he said and I felt stupid. \"How could I be so naïve?\" I muttered burying my head in my hands. \"No, don\\'t say that. You couldn\\'t know, this is your first time after all,\" he defended and it made me feel somewhat better. 04:30 am American mountain time –Albuquerque- \"Here we are,\" Troy stated and closed the door behind me. \"Did you enjoy the trip?\" he questioned and I couldn\\'t do anything else than smile. \"I had a great time Troy. It was a little rocky at times, but that is always how I imagined these large family gatherings. I was just happy that I got invited and most of your family was so accepting,\" I stated. \"That\\'s good. I was a little nervous to be honest but it went much better than I thought. By the way, when is Maria picking you up?\" he questioned. \"I said I just wanted to call her after we got home, and I knew more. It won\\'t be for a couple of hours at least. I\\'m so tired,\" I stated. \"Let\\'s just leave everything here and head to bed. We can figure it out later,\" he stated and it sounded like a wonderful idea at the moment. \"Hey hija,\" mom greeted me as she picked me up from Troy just after noon. \"Did you have a good time?\" she questioned hugging me. \"I did,\" I confirmed before turning to Troy. \"I\\'ll see you at school on Monday?\" I asked. \"Yeah, see you then,\" he said with a nod of his head. We said our goodbyes and I sat down in my mom\\'s car as she drove home. \"So how was it?\" she wondered as she was making some lunch a little later on. \"It was fun. His family was really great and rather welcoming. At dinner, on Christmas eve we were seventeen people I believe but on New Year\\'s eve it was just his parents, us and both of his grandparents,\" I shared. \"I really came along great with his cousin Makayla but not so much with her twin brother Calvin. I don\\'t know why though, maybe because I got on so well with Makayla and not him?\" I questioned to myself. \"I don\\'t know hija, but it sounds like you had a lot of fun. What did they think about the recipe book?\" she asked. \"They loved it. Oh, that reminds me. I got a snow globe from Makayla. I can show you it later,\" I said to her and she smiled. \"That was thoughtful of her,\" mom remarked. Then the dreaded questioned came to my mind, and I figured I had to ask her sooner rather than later. \"Mom?\" I started nervously and she turned towards me. \"Yes?\" she questioned taking her coffee cup, taking a seat on the opposite side. \"How would you feel if I studied abroad next year?\" I asked and watched as her facial expression quickly changed from surprise to a small smile. \"Well, then I were wondering where you thought about,\" she said and I felt a little more relaxed. She didn\\'t reject the idea completely… Yet. \"Etrea,\" I stated. \"There was one specific college that I looked at and they accept and encourage international students to apply,\" I told her waiting for a reaction. \"I am a little surprise, but I think I expected something like this to happen. What is the name of the school?\" she questioned and I felt more relieved. \"Royal College of Etrea.\" \"Does it have something to do with the fact that Troy is applying there?\" she questioned with a knowing smile. \"No, not exactly but it did influence my decision. I have looked at their website and done some research and I learned that there are way more applicants than places. I want to send in an application, but I doubt that I will get accepted,\" I explained to mom who had a smile on her face. \"It is true and you will forever wonder if you never tried, so yes do it, but you are still applying for schools here in America right?\" she questioned looking at me. \"Of course,\" I hurried to say. \"I have sent an application to Yale, Stanford, University of Albuquerque, and Berkeley,\" I confirmed and she smiled. \"Good. When is the deadline?\" she questioned. \"February 1st but I sort of already started,\" I admitted and she smiled. \"Thank you mom,\" I said and got up to give her a hug. \"No problem hija. Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes.\" So a rather long chapter since this is delayed *cough* again *cough* Please tell me what you think in a review!

I had really hoped to meet up with Gabriella during that time since she was busy tomorrow with the decathlon team, but I also had responsibilities towards the basketball team seeing as Chad and I were co-captains. Why they still believed in me as their co-captain seeing as I broke my arm not long into the season, still amazed me. \"Yeah I\\'m free,\" I said to him. \"Should we just meet in the gym?\" he questioned as we walked together towards homeroom. \"Sounds great,\" I agreed and we sat down in our seats still continuing to discuss basketball and the upcoming season. It wasn\\'t long after that both Taylor and Gabriella entered the room laughing about something but before we knew it the bell was sounded and Darbus entered the classroom. \"All right settle down, settle down. I know you all had an exciting holiday lets focus on the fantastic art of theatre and some news today shall we?\" she questioned but everyone remained quiet. \"Now as you all know proximity to the art is cleansing for the soul, and therefore it is a great opportunity to study The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde,\" she told all of us before hurrying to add, \"this could very well become rather important for your English class as well,\" she defended and started handing out copies of the play. \"Now, let\\'s start on act one,\" she said and everyone opened the play. \"Sadly that is everything we have time for today. Now I would like to give a few announcements. Now everyone a reminder that the spring musical signup sheet will be posted later today on the board by our president for the drama club, Sharpay Evans,\" Darbus announced and Sharpay smirked giving a small nod of confidence. \"Final deadline in two weeks,\" she reminded us all but I doubted that many other than Sharpay bothered to sign up. I knew I did not have time because of finals and basketball taking up much of my time already. \"Taylor McKessie has volunteered to be this year\\'s yearbook editor, so questions regarding that may be brought forward to her. The yearbook committee encourages students who want to participate to do such, they have several different places for you to excel in your talents,\" she said making some large gesture with her hands. \"Now is there any questions?\" she continued but everyone stayed silent. Well, almost everyone. \"Yes, Jason?\" \"How was your holiday Mrs Darbus?\" he asked and a collective groan went through the class. \"Oh, really,\" Darbus said surprised pushing her glasses higher up on her nose. \"Well, one fond memory comes to mind. It was the summer of…\" she started but was soon drowned by the bell and students piling out of the classroom, not interested in hearing the story. \"Remember the signup for the musical!\" she told all of her students as the last one was out of the room. \"Hey Troy,\" Gabriella said as she and Taylor caught up with Chad and I in the hallway. \"Good morning,\" I said as we were making our way towards Spanish. \"How was Christmas?\" Taylor questioned us all and I shrugged a little. \"I had fun,\" Gabriella told her friend. \"Yeah, how was Christmas with Troy abroad?\" Chad encouraged. \"Really fun, but he has a big family. We were seventeen people in total for dinner on Christmas eve,\" Gabriella shared not really going into too much detail. Now I see how my secret really is affecting her too. It isn\\'t fair towards her or my friends… \"Seventeen,\" Taylor said astonished bringing me out of my thoughts. \"How was that living so close for such a long time?\" she questioned and I tried really hard to hide my smile. She had no idea… \"It was hard at times especially if you don\\'t get along,\" she said with a sigh and Chad looked puzzled. \"I have two cousins who are twins, Makayla and Calvin,\" I shared encouraging Gabriella to tell the rest of the story. \"I got along great with Makayla but not so much with Calvin. It didn\\'t help that he had a fight with his parents or something, but that day Troy and I went out riding together and it was so fun,\" she said and I were happy to hear that, especially with the picture of us in that magazine. \"Oh that sounds like fun,\" Taylor said and the two of them engaged in a conversation of their own. Thursday 10 th As the double lesson in geography was finished that morning Chad and I were sitting in the gym planning what we had to do to elevate our game in hope to make it towards the championship. \"When are you removing your cast?\" Chad questioned as if he had suddenly realised something. \"I was told after eight weeks so that would be around the 9th of February,\" I said to him. \"So after that, you can join playing again?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"That\\'s the plan.\" Before either of us knew it, the bell for lunch rang and we both agreed that we were just about finished with all of the planning. As we both got our lunch we found Taylor, Martha and Gabriella in a deep but hushed conversation. \"No way. It\\'s just a silly rumour,\" I heard Taylor say as we got closer. \"How do you know that?\" Martha defied. \"What do we really know?\" she questioned not having noticed that both I and Chad were right by the table. \"Hello,\" Chad simply said and the three of them looked at us as we sat down. \"I\\'m just saying,\" Martha said before walking back towards her table leaving the four of us alone. \"What was that all about?\" I questioned confused. \"Decathlon stuff,\" Taylor said rather quickly stabbing her salad with the fork. Looking over at Gabriella she even looked surprised about Taylor\\'s reaction. Hopefully, she could provide me with some answers later, seeing as now was not the best time to ask questions. \"What happened during lunch?\" I questioned as it was only Gabriella and I walking towards class together. \"And I know it wasn\\'t about the scholastic decathlon team,\" I stated and she sighed in defeat. \"Martha said that she had heard something from one of the other cheerleaders. A rumour if you will, except that Martha was certain that it wasn\\'t a rumour because the girl found out herself,\" she started. \"So it was one of the cheerleaders who found out and told Martha?\" I clarified and she nodded. \"Yes.\" \"What Martha told us was that her friend has seen an article while at the library doing some research about the Japanese war or something for history class. Apparently, while looking through sources she could use, she found a book who had been misplaced or something. She must have opened it thinking it could be valuable, but what she found was a long article about the Etrean royal family…\" \"And a picture,\" she added a little reluctant. \"Martha said that the picture wasn\\'t recently but not much older than three maybe four years or so,\" Gabriella finished. \"I have a feeling I know what book it came from and if Martha, or Taylor for that matter, had seen it, they would quickly have identified it as me,\" I spoke quietly not wanting to get overheard. \"Maryl Laflamme wrote it three years ago just after she published Stars of Magic. It was huge in the media seeing as she got a rather personal angle at our family that no one else had thought of,\" I shared with her and she nodded understandingly. We walked in silence together until we reached the classroom. \"Wait,\" I told Gabriella taking her hand before she entered the room. I pulled her gently away from the door and she frowned looking at me. \"Should I just tell them?\" I questioned and she sighed making a face. \"I can\\'t tell you that nor do I know what is for the best. That is something you have to determine for yourself,\" she advised me and I was really conflicted about the situation. \"I guess I am a little afraid of their reaction,\" I confessed and she looked at me somatically. \"I don\\'t know but know that I will support you no matter what you decide,\" she told me and I smiled. \"Thank you, it means a lot,\" I said to her just as the warning bell was sounded. The next day I had asked if Chad and Taylor wanted to meet me and Gabriella during lunch because I had something to tell them. Gabriella and I entered the science room that the scholastic decathlon team normally used for practising. \"Hey you two,\" Taylor said putting away her book. \"Hey,\" Gabriella said taking a seat. \"Why the meet here?\" Chad questioned. \"So we could talk without getting overheard,\" I stated and Taylor frowned a little. \"Oh?\" \"Gabriella told me about what Martha said the other day,\" I started and a look of realization crossed Taylor\\'s face. \"So you\\'re here to say it was all a rumour. Why couldn\\'t we meet somewhere else?\" Chad stated but I didn\\'t say anything. \"It\\'s a little more complicated than that,\" I started. \"I haven\\'t been completely honest with you about who I am…\" I started telling them the whole story, which was pretty similar to the one I told Gabriella a couple of months ago. \"What?\" Chad stated but Taylor kept quiet. \"Why didn\\'t you tell us sooner?\" he questioned. \"I didn\\'t know how to tell you or what you would think,\" I tried to reason with them but before I got the chance to say anything more the bell went off. \"I\\'m sorry, I\\'ll be late for class,\" Taylor excused herself picking up her stuff before leaving the room. And at that moment I suddenly realised how much I had potentially damaged the relationship between Gabriella and Taylor by asking her to keep it a secret… Huge shout-out to Lia and Grace for their reviews! And a tiny spoiler to Grace about your question, yes there will become drama. Lots of drama! To Lia, yes I have tried to write this chapter more detailed, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t see your review until the last chapter was published so I am trying my best with this one. Hope you all liked it and please leave a review on your thoughts! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 21] ['Hey! Sorry I have been sort of MIA for some time, but my half term mock exams have made me really busy but the good thing is that I only have one left on Tuesday. I haven\\'t completely neglected the story either, so I finished this chapter on Thursday and started on chapter 22 so hopefully, that will be on time. I also have started a Pinterest page from this story so if you want to see pictures that I just have had on my computer and used for inspiration/ideas go check that out!

Friday 11 th of January \"Taylor hang on a minute,\" Gabriella told her friend after class. A little reluctant Taylor stayed behind waiting. \"What?\" she asked sounding slightly annoyed. \"We need to talk,\" Gabriella stated and Taylor huffed looking at her. \"Obviously we do. How come you kept something like this a secret? I\\'m your best friend, or at least I thought I was,\" she said hurt. \"Taylor you are,\" Gabriella hurried to say. \"Then why keep it a secret?\" she fired back. \"Let me explain,\" Gabriella said raising her voice slightly and this time Taylor didn\\'t say anything. \"You remember back in October when Troy and I didn\\'t speak and I refused to tell you why. We had been camping and on the way back he told me about who he was. He told me everything. What he has told all of us is true, except that he is the prince of Etrea,\" Gabriella explained her voice hushed so they wouldn\\'t get overheard. \"Why keep it a secret from us when he told you?\" Taylor frowned being more civil towards Gabriella. \"Because there was a reason for why he never told anyone of us.\" Gabriella started to reason. \"He never shared with you how he was home-schooled for six years because no one saw him as just Troy. He never shared that he is always in the eye of the public and has his own bodyguard who have been following him since he was three years old. He never shared that he barely had any true friends beside his cousins and best friend. When his best friend moved away he was left alone again and he decided that going to school halfway across the earth was better than staying in Etrea,\" Gabriella finished and Taylor was stunned at this point. \"Troy has told me all of this and I experienced much of it when I celebrated Christmas with him,\" Gabriella shared with her friend who were trying to comprehend the load of new information. \"I would never have guessed that it was like that…\" Taylor trailed off still keeping her gaze at her friend. \"If I promise I won\\'t tell anyone, will you tell me? Everything?\" she questioned and Gabriella felt herself smile. \"Yeah, after school? I don\\'t want to be late for homeroom,\" Gabriella said and the two girls hurried off towards class both smiling. \"I saw you and Taylor come to class together. Did the two of you sort it out?\" Troy questioned as they were walking home that day. \"Yeah we talked after class and sorted some things out. She\\'s coming over tomorrow and we are going to work on some scholastic decathlon stuff. When we spoke after class I sort of told her some things that you have only shared with me. I hope that was okay,\" Gabriella told her boyfriend and he took her hand squeezing it gently. \"Of course. I knew you had to say something and I never wanted to ruin the friendship you and Taylor have because of my secret. Let me guess, Taylor wanted to know everything?\" he questioned and Gabriella nodded slowly. \"Yeah,\" she breathed out relieved that he didn\\'t mind her sharing his story. \"You should tell her,\" he encouraged as she became quiet. \"I talked with Chad but he didn\\'t seem as hurt as Taylor luckily. I also told Martha and Kelsi as they were in the classroom and they were bound to know at some point. Chad and I also agreed to tell Zeke and Jason,\" Troy shared as they had now reached Gabriella\\'s house. \"See you on Monday Troy, have a nice week-end.\" \"See you Brie,\" Troy said and Gabriella walked up her driveway. \"So spill,\" Taylor said as the two girls were sitting on Gabriella\\'s bed. Books and papers scattered around them. \"How was it?\" she questioned and Gabriella smiled giggling a little before looking up at her friend. \"Weird, exciting, educational, a little scary and really fun,\" Gabriella said trying to summarise her experience. \"Oh wow. Elaborate,\" Taylor said crossing her legs. \"Well, it all started the day we left, which was the day after school was out. Or rather that night. Our flight left at four in the morning so we got picked up at three thirty in the morning and already from there it started getting weird. His bodyguard and a few other from the security team picked us up. I\\'m sorry I don\\'t know how much of that I can share, it was rather intimidating seeing all of them, even though Troy\\'s bodyguards were friendly enough…\" Gabriella trailed off and Taylor raised her eyebrows in surprise. \"Anyways, we were driven towards the airport and the car stopped right next to the plane. It was so surreal stepping out of the car and walking 150ft before entering the small plane. It was like the one we see as business jets or private jets and we flew that to Los Angeles,\" Gabriella told her but stopped once she saw the look Taylor gave her. \"So you didn\\'t fly with an airline? They had organised own flights?\" Taylor questioned and Gabriella nodded. \"Yeah, besides the security and the two of us we were alone one the aircraft. It was rather surreal… Anyways, after landing in LA we got on board this huge two story aircraft and Troy shared that the plane belonged to the Etrean royal family and was used to transport them wherever they needed. I guess it is much like the president have Air Force one, but I mean that plane was massive and again it was just the two of us on board. We didn\\'t even notice the security as they were upstairs,\" Gabriella trailed off looking at her friend who was eager for more information. \"So after a twelve-hour flight we landed in Etrea, and it was so beautiful looking at all the snow, but freezing. As we were driven to his home, I was just mesmerized as I looked outside of the window. I don\\'t think I have ever seen so much snow before. His family started coming over the next couple of days and the day before Christmas eve he had to join his family to church. As he had left his cousins came and Makayla and I hit it off immediately. Her brother on the other hand didn\\'t seem to like me….\" Gabriella said before continuing. \"It was the morning of Christmas eve I believe that we were eating breakfast together and when his grandmother questioned what had happened to Troy\\'s arm, he just said that it swelled during the night and Calvin came with this remark. I don\\'t even know what he said because I believe he had switched to Japanese as it is their second language. I believe that they had a small argument, but Troy wouldn\\'t tell me what it was…\" she trailed off and Taylor looked at her shocked. She shifted on the bed before looking at her friend puzzled. \"Why wouldn\\'t he tell you if it concerned you?\" she questioned baffled. \"I don\\'t know. He said that I didn\\'t have to think about it,\" Gabriella recalled before she suddenly remembered something. \"I also got a gift from Makayla at Christmas eve,\" she mentioned and got up from the bed. Walking over to the bookshelf where she had placed it, she retrieved the small object before walking back sitting down on the bed again. She gave it to Taylor who were studying the snow globe. \"Wow, that\\'s beautiful,\" she commented and Gabriella smiled. \"Yeah, it was really thoughtful of her. The castle you see is the Etrean castle in Iwaki,\" Gabriella mentioned and something suddenly dawned on Taylor. \"You mean the one where the royal family live, and Troy?\" she questioned and Gabriella nodded. \"Yup,\" Gabriella confirmed as Taylor studied the castle. \"It just seems so weird. To look at this and know that he lives there,\" Taylor commented handing the snow globe back to Gabriella. \"Why didn\\'t Calvin like you, you suspect?\" Taylor questioned switching topic and Gabriella thought for a minute as she put the globe back on the shelf. \"I have actually been wondering about the same thing,\" she confessed turning back towards Taylor who nodded. \"It was almost as if he was set on not liking me. I actually got lost one day as Troy was doing something with his two cousins. I headed in the wrong direction and I ended up having to call him. I was so lost,\" Gabriella stated sitting back down on the bed as Taylor were thinking. \"I know it probably sounds stupid, but could he have been jealous?\" \"Maybe…\" Gabriella reasoned. \"But I don\\'t understand why he could have been. I mean, it wasn\\'t like he never was with them,\" she tried to reason. \"But he did walk away from whatever he was doing with them to find you.\" \"I thought about that, but Makayla didn\\'t say anything about that it was only Calvin who got angry,\" Gabriella reasoned. \"I hope that wasn\\'t the cause…\" Gabriella tried off. \"We should get back to work,\" Gabriella stated and Taylor gave a smile before they continued with their work. Monday, January 14 th \"Settle down, settle down,\" Mr. Howie said trying to quiet the loud class that Monday afternoon. \"Now as our next chapter is the English speaking countries of the world, I have decided to make this chapter a project...\" the rest of his sentence was drowned by majority of the class groaning. \"There there,\" Mr. Howie tried to explain, \"this time you are going to choose your own groups and country. My two simple rules are no group can have the same country and the groups shouldn\\'t be much bigger than four maybe five people. Understood? Great,\" Mr. Howie said walking over to the blackboard, grabbing the chalk before writing it up. \"Now is there already someone who knows the group they want to work in?\" Troy had a really bad feeling about this assignment. What if someone choose Etrea, found out everything and presented it for the whole class? There were already rumours floating about him he did not need for them to escalate or confirmed. \"Yes Mr. Danforth?\" their teacher said interrupting Troy\\'s thoughts. \"Mr Howie, me, Taylor, Gabriella, and Troy,\" Chad started and Troy turned around at the sound of his best friend\\'s voice. His previous panic level sinking a little but he mentally prayed that Chad did not screw up this one. \"We would like to have our presentation about Etrea,\" Chad told the teacher who nodded writing down something. \"Excellent. It has actually been years since someone last choose that country so I am looking forward to your presentation. Anyone else?\" he said and Troy relaxed. Crisis most likely avoided. It was ok for his friends to know but he wouldn\\'t want the whole school to know. \"All right if there are no other suggestions I have some groups for you,\" their teacher said after several minutes of small discussions and gesturing. \"Miss Evans, Miss Nielsen, Mr Evans and Mr Baylor you are one group. Feel free to choose your country. Mr Cross, Miss Cox, Miss Gold and Mr Zara, the same goes for you,\" Mr. Howie said and formed different groups. \"Now as you go into groups I want to know which country you are choosing and I will cross them off the board. Also I believe you all should be finished within the next two weeks but we\\'ll see if you perhaps need another week,\" he said and everyone moved into their groups. \"Thanks,\" Troy told Chad quietly as they sat together at a table. \"Hey anytime,\" Chad said as the noise level visibly died down. \"So Troy since you are the most knowledge about the ruling system in Etrea would you like to take that section?\" Taylor questioned her voice amused as she put her book down on the table. \"I would love to do that,\" Troy said holding back a laugh. \"So should we divide what each of us should focus on?\" Taylor questioned and Gabriella nodded agreeing. \"Sounds good,\" Chad agreed and Taylor wrote something down in her notebook. \"So Troy you\\'re doing the ruling system; Gabi do you know what you want to investigate?\" \"I could do some historical aspects and such,\" she suggested and Taylor wrote that down. \"Chad?\" \"I have no idea yet. I am not entirely sure if I know exactly where Etrea is situated even,\" he said quietly to his group. \"Then it\\'s fitting that you do the geography part,\" Taylor concluded and both of the girls were laughing quietly. \"I could look at the average GDP, expected life age and such,\" Taylor said after scanning the sheet the teacher had just handed out to the different groups. \"Sounds great. If we find out there is something we are lacking we could just take something each,\" Troy said and everyone nodded, agreeing. \"You guys could come over to my house after school on Wednesday and we could get some work done,\" Troy suggested and Gabriella smiled nodding. \"Sounds good,\" Taylor stated. \"Speak of getting an easy grade,\" Gabriella heard the cheerleaders say as she was collecting some books from her locker. \"I mean that is low even for her. They are all going to get a good grade, I mean even the teacher said he is looking forward to their presentation. Using her boyfriend like that…\" the cheerleaders said and Gabriella closer her locker walking away. She wasn\\'t the one who asked to have the project about Etrea. Chad was the one who asked about the group and country! It wasn\\'t like she was going to use Troy to do her research… She had been to Etrea experiencing the culture on her own, and reading books. After all she was going to use the library and other internet sources… Hope you all liked it! Shout-out to Lia, Grace and for their review on the last chapter! Please feel free to check out my Pinterest page for pictures that I try to describe in the story, but also inspired me. /freeflyingwriter9646/ I am planning on incorporating more of that into some of the later chapters as there will be more twists, maybe some of you picked up on it in this chapter? I have a bad foreshadow here ;) Grace as you probably have seen here, I didn\\'t want Taylor and Gabriella to have a long fight, even though that is most like them if I were a hundred percent true to the movie. I didn\\'t just for the sake of this story ;) Lia, I am happy to answer questions in the reviews I receive and especially if they are guest reviews seeing as I can\\'t send them a PM. Happy you liked the chapter and I hope you like where I am taking this story after some chapters.'][Chapter 22] ['Hey everone! I am so sorry that this chapter is delayed. School has been crazy and I had time off to work on what equals to an undergraduate study and yes I am in 12 th grade of high school. Hopefully things will become better after the 13 th but I am not too sure… Anyways I now have started to get a good sense about where I wanted this story to head and now I am actually committed to the idea. Not entirely sure what you will think about it but I hope for the best. Huge shout-out to Grace and Pumpkinking5 for your reviews it meant the world to me. Thank you to everyone else who are favouring and/or following this story! You keep me going! \" I mean that is low even for her. They are all going to get a good grade, I mean even the teacher said he is looking forward to their presentation. Using her boyfriend like that…\" the cheerleaders said and Gabriella closer her locker walking away. She wasn\\'t the one who asked to have the project about Etrea. Chad was the one who asked about the group and country! It wasn\\'t like she was going to use Troy… She had been there for herself and she was going to use the library and other internet sources… Wednesday January 16 th \"This is frustrating,\" Troy said placing the computer on the coffee table. Taylor who was sitting cross legged on the floor looked up with a curious look. \"Can\\'t find what you\\'re looking for?\" she questioned amused. \"More like having to find evidence about what I already know,\" he said and turned the pc so Taylor saw the screen. One glance at the screen and she just started giggling. Troy was reading through the information page about the Etrean royal family. Beside the text was a rather large picture of Troy\\'s grandfather, his father and himself. \"How old is this picture? It doesn\\'t look like it is that old,\" Taylor commented and Troy nodded. At this point both Gabriella and Chad was looking up from the book they were reading, listening on the conversation. \"It\\'s about two years old,\" he told them remembering when it was taken. \"It was taken just after I turned sixteen,\" he explained to them and Taylor nodded before returning to her work. \"I\\'m going to get something to drink, cuz this is giving me a headache,\" Troy declared and rose from the couch. \"Anybody else want something?\" he questioned looking at his friends whom all nodded. He returned only minutes later with water and soda that he placed on the coffee table before picking up his computer again with a new idea to where he could get a source. It was now just short of nine thirty in the evening and Gabriella and Troy were the only one still working. Both Taylor and Chad having left about an hour ago. \"There,\" Gabriella said and looked up meeting the curious gaze of her boyfriend. \"Done?\" he questioned and she shook her head with a smile playing on her lips, amused by his comment. \"No, but I found some information that I had to re-write and finally I got through it all,\" she told him. \"What time is it?\" she added after looking outside of the window \"Nine thirty,\" Troy answered and she raised her eyebrows in surprise. \"Really? I think I should head home then. We have school tomorrow after all,\" she said with a sigh getting up from the floor. \"Yeah…\" he trailed off following her out into the hallway. \"I guess I will see you tomorrow?\" she questioned and he smiled. \"Defiantly,\" he nodded and took her hands. \"Good night,\" he said and she smiled as her cheeks turned a faint shade of red. \"Good night Troy,\" she told him and Troy gave her a soft kiss on the lips. She picked up her backpack before opening the door and walked outside. Troy stood in the door and gave her a last wave before she continued down the road. Thursday January 17 th \"Gabi do you have a minute?\" Taylor questioned after geography the next morning. \"Yeah,\" |she said picking up her stuff, facing her best friend. \"So I was asked to edit the yearbook and I can\\'t do it alone,\" Taylor explained as the two girls walked out into the crowded hallway. \"Who asked you to do it?\" Gabriella questioned curiously as they were heading towards their lockers. \"Mrs Darbus, but what I wanted to know was if you would help me. It is just the editing we would be doing,\" she hurried to reassure her sceptical friend. \"I don\\'t know,\" Gabriella said her voice low and hesitant. \"Please Gabriella. I could really need your help and I couldn\\'t say no to Mrs Darbus. Plus, Martha desperately needed help in prom committee after someone bailed on her last minute, and Mrs Darbus also asked me to get information about the meeting times and inform the class seeing as I am the class president,\" she said meeting Gabriella\\'s eyes and Taylor saw that she was uncertain. \"Please,\" Taylor begged folding her hands. \"All right I\\'ll do it,\" she finally agreed and Taylor let out a small squeal. \"Yes thank you, thank you,\" she said and hugged her friend. \"When are we meeting?\" she questioned and Taylor nodded. \"There hasn\\'t been an official schedule yet , but we are working on it so it won\\'t conflict with the prom committee meeting, scholastic decathlon and such,\" she explained and Gabriella let out a small groan. \"Taylor,\" she said annoyed. \"What?\" she questioned un affected by her friend\\'s reaction. \"Do they expect us to stay at school until midnight? I still have a life outside of the school that I enjoy living thank you very much,\" she told her friend somewhat sarcastically and Taylor shook her head. \"Relax it won\\'t be that bad,\" Taylor tried to encourage her friend. \"Keep in mind that we both have AP classes, finals and decathlon meeting and competitions that we all hope to win. We haven\\'t come this far to lose now, besides this could very well come to a sticky end,\" Gabriella muttered darkly. \"It will be fine. Listen I promised to help Sophia with something before the decathlon meeting tomorrow so I should probably find her. See you in history?\" she questioned and I nodded. \"Yeah see you then,\" Gabriella said dragging a hand through her hair as Taylor closed her locker before hurrying down towards the library. Gabriella dug through her locker and found some homework she could start on before heading towards the room they used for scholastic decathlon meeting, which she knew were available. Walking into the room she didn\\'t bother to close the door completely before she walked over to a desk and dumped her stuff on the floor and sat down in the chair. She bent over and picked up her calculus book before opening it and starting on next week\\'s homework. \"Oh my gosh have you heard?\" she heard voices gush outside of the door after only a couple of minutes. It didn\\'t take her long before she recognized the voices as two of the head cheerleaders Brittany and Alexandra. \"You know the assignment for English class? I was researching and you\\'ll never guess what I found out,\" Brittany exclaimed. \"Troy Bolton is not who he says he is. Take a look at this,\" she said and Gabriella could hear the sound of a magazine being opened. \"No way,\" Alexandra said flipping through the magazine. \"A prince. There is no way he would end up here in little Albuquerque,\" she stated shocked. \"Oh yes but it gets better. Take a look at this picture. Gabriella obviously knew because that is her kissing him, if not then he is cheating on her,\" Brittany stated and Gabriella scoffed quietly to herself. \"How can Gabriella manage to score someone like that? I mean look at her. She isn\\'t popular, she is a part of the scholastic decathlon team which makes her just a geek like the rest of them and rumours has it that she is even pulling straight A\\'s. I mean come on. Troy is the co-captain of the basketball team and quite possibly the most popular jock at East High. Just to top everything off he is the future king of a whole freaking country! He should be dating someone like us and not someone like here! \" Brittany stated annoyed and Gabriella put her pencil down quietly as she realised her whole hand were shaking. \"I don\\'t know Brittany,\" Alexandra stated. \"She was the only one who were nice to him when he came and we didn\\'t like him until he became a part of the basketball team,\" Alexandra pointed out and Brittany huffed. \"That is not the point Alexandra. Why would the one guy at East High which is quite possibly the most popular go out with the one girl who are at the bottom of the social ladder here at East? She\\'s just a freaky math girl and that\\'s it,\" Brittany said before there was a slam of the locker door closing. \"We don\\'t want to be late for practice so we can check out the guys playing,\" she said her whole voice changing to a more cheerful, and slightly flirty one, before the only sound that was heard were the echoes of their shoes walking down the hallway. Gabriella\\'s breaths came in shallow gasps as she tried to hold back the tears that were threatening to leave her eyes. She didn\\'t realise that she had picked up her pencil again and her grip were so hard that her knuckles were slowly turned white. The tears finally broke free and streamed down her cheek like never ending waterfalls. Her whole body shaking like a leaf as the memories overcame here once again. She was taken by surprised by the bell signalling the end of the lesson and start of lunch. Using the sleeve of her cardigan she wiped away the rest of her tears and tried to compose herself. Looking down she saw the wet page in her notebook, still not scribbled on. Stained by her tears. She grabbed the edge of the paper before tearing it out and crumbled it together. Quickly packing away her book and notebook she shoved it into her backpack before throwing it over her shoulder and making her way out of the classroom making sure she threw the paper on her way. Sitting down at the usual table with her lunch Kelsi were the only one seated there. \"Hey Kelsi,\" Gabriella said and the aspiring pianist looked up from her sheet of music. \"Hey Gabriella. I was starting to fear that I had to eat alone,\" she said and removed the stack of notes. \"No I\\'m here, but where are everyone else?\" she questioned. \"Basketball practice I presume. I don\\'t know about Taylor thought,\" she said thoughtfully and Gabriella grabbed a bite of her sandwich. \"Taylor is doing some sort of tutoring/guidance for Sophia before the decathlon meeting,\" Gabriella answered as Kelsi pulled the red tray with food closer towards her. \"Oh okay,\" Kelsi said and observed Gabriella for a minute as the noise level were visibly rising in the cafeteria. \"Are you all right?\" Kelsi questioned putting down the fork for her salad. \"Oh yeah, yeah. I\\'m fine,\" Gabriella hurried to say as Kelsi studied her. \"You seemed to drift away,\" Kelsi mentioned and Gabriella tried to give a convincing smile. \"I\\'m just thinking. Taylor basically begged me for help with the editing of the yearbook and I said yes. I don\\'t know why though… I still have my AP classes, finals and the scholastic decathlon meetings,\" Gabriella told Kelsi, her shoulders sagging down. \"You always help everyone that is just who you are,\" Kelsi encouraged her friend and a genuine smile found a way to Gabriella\\'s lips. \"Are you thinking about the musicals this semester?\" Kelsi bravely asked knowing how much she enjoyed it last semester. \"I haven\\'t thought about it to be honest. I will see,\" was her simple answer. \"Hey mom,\" Gabriella said as she opened the front door that afternoon after having spotted her mother\\'s car parked in the drive way. \"Hey hija. How was your day?\" she questioned coming out from the kitchen. \"Good,\" she said dumping her backpack by the door. \"You\\'re home early,\" she pointed out following her mother into the kitchen. \"Yes. There was a sudden work trip that I have to prepare for. I am leaving early tomorrow morning for New York. I should be home by Sunday,\" she said and Gabriella\\'s shoulders fell. \"I\\'m sorry hija. The company didn\\'t think the deal would happen in the first place and it was only settled this morning that I had to leave,\" she tried to explain to her mother. \"No it\\'s okay,\" Gabriella said with a wave of her hand. \"I understand you have to,\" she continued. \"I still would have told you earlier if I had known,\" she promised. \"Listen why don\\'t invite one of your friends or something over after school on Friday or Saturday? I\\'ll leave some money on the counter so you could order some pizza or Chinese?\" Maria said and Gabriella smiled at her thoughtfulness. \"Could Troy come over? No sleepover?\" she bargained and Maria were a little hesitant at once. \"Please?\" Gabriella asked looking hopefully at her mother. \"All right no sleepover,\" she agreed and Gabriella hugged her mother. \"Thank you,\" she stated happily and it brought a smile to her face. Friday As Gabriella unlocked the door to her home after school the next day it was quiet. She flickered on the light in the hallway and made her way towards the kitchen. On the counter she saw a note from her mother along with some money. She picked up the paper and her eyes scanned the letters. \" Dear Gabriella, there is food in the fridge that you can heat up for tonight and money for take-out on Saturday. I will try and call you tonight after the meeting and I should be home by five on Sunday. Have fun and I love you xoxo Mom\" Gabriella heated up the dinner that her mother had put in the fridge as she sat down before the TV to watch some show she found. After eating she picked up her phone that was on the table behind her and dialled her boyfriend\\'s number. After several rings there were no answer so she hung up and found her laptop instead. After logging into Facebook she noticed that Troy were online, so she sent him a message Gabriella. 5:32 pm Hey are you up to anything? I tried call but you didn\\'t answer… Several minutes later he was still online but he hadn\\'t seen her message. She moved her mouse towards the video icon and pressed it as the call started. \"Hey Brie,\" he smiled as he answered. \"Hey Troy. You look good,\" she stated as she saw the black suite he was wearing. \"Oh thanks. I just saw the message, I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t pick up. I put it on silent,\" he said. \"It\\'s all right,\" she said dismissively but Troy saw that it bothered her. He grabbed the computer and moved it with him towards the living room. \"You\\'re probably wondering about why I am dressed like this?\" he questioned raising an eyebrow. \"Just a little,\" Gabriella giggled. \"It looks a little out of place on a Friday night,\" she stated. \"It all right. There was an incident in Iwaki and the council suggested that I should sit in on the meeting. However, my grandfather said it was a wonderful idea, except that I was abroad studying. The of course someone pointed out that I could join in on the meeting via Skype which lead to this,\" he said moving his hand in front of his suit making Gabriella laugh. \"When is the meeting?\" she questioned and he looked at the clock. \"At six so I have time to talk,\" he assured her. \"You said you tried to call me?\" he questioned and she nodded. \"Right… I was wondering if you wanted to come over tomorrow and just hang out? Mom isn\\'t home tomorrow so it would just be the two of us,\" she stated and at once she saw his face expression she knew he couldn\\'t. \"I am sorry. I would love to except that I have plans already. The Wildcats have an away game against South High tomorrow at ten. Despite not playing I should be there for the team,\" he explained and Gabriella nodded. \"No of course. I understand. There has just been so much that I sort of forgot it. Taylor asked me yesterday if I wanted to help her edit the yearbook and I said yes,\" Gabriella sighed. \"I don\\'t mind helping Taylor but I am fearing it might be a little much with the scholastic decathlon team, AP classes, college and exams. I still have a college application that I have to write and submit,\" she said and Troy raised an eyebrow in surprise. \"I thought you were finished?\" he questioned and she nodded. \"I was, but then I sort of started an application to attend Royal College of Etrea. I have to finish that one before the 23rd of January,\" Gabriella confessed. She hadn\\'t really planned on telling Troy about her application to the school because she knew that there was a slim chance of her getting accepted, despite the fact that she was counting as an international student. \"What?\" Troy questioned amazed. \"When did you decide?\" he questioned a smile spreading on his face. \"During the holidays. I actually started it before I told mom but she was really encouraging about it. I was a little surprised actually,\" she confessed and Troy were still smiling. \"I spoke with the guidance counsellor earlier and she arranged for me to take this English language test that is required since I don\\'t have English as my mother tongue,\" she said with a tired sigh. \"But you have lived in America almost your whole life and you\\'re going to a regular high school which are teaching in English. Doesn\\'t that count for something?\" he questioned. \"Apparently not because as I was selecting my mother tongue they asked for grades and a copy of the test. It takes a couple of days for me to receive the score but just as long as I have proof that I have taken the test it should be all right,\" she explained to him and watched as he buttoned the last couple of buttons on his white shirt and reached for the tie, placing it around his neck. \"Are you managing to do it this time?\" she questioned mockingly and Troy laughed. \"Ha ha,\" he said sarcastically and concentrated on tying it. Somehow he managed to tie the knot and tightened it, pushing the collar of his shirt down. \"Does it look all right?\" he questioned worried and Gabriella smiled nodding. \"It looks great. You look very handsome,\" she smiled and a small blush crept to her cheeks. \"I am glad you think so because I really hope I don\\'t have to stand up,\" he told her and she cocked her head to the side. \"Why?\" she questioned curiously and Troy proceeded to stand up showing her exactly why. The ends of his tie weren\\'t exactly lined up as it should be and instead of wearing black dress pants he was wearing regular jeans. \"Oh my god,\" she said and burst out into a fit of laughter. \"Glad I amused someone,\" he said giving her a lopsided grin Gabriella had fallen in love with. \"I am sorry but I have to hang up. The meeting is supposed to start any minute now, so I expect the call to come pretty soon,\" he explained apologetic. \"Don\\'t worry Troy I understand. Break a leg tomorrow, well not literally. It\\'s enough with your arm,\" she said and now Troy were the one to laugh. \"Thank you. Love you,\" he said trying to compose himself. \"Love you too,\" she said and their call ended. She put the laptop on her lap and opened her application. \"Let\\'s see what we can get done,\" she muttered to herself and started filling out. This is it! Way longer than normal but I hope you, sort off, like where this is going. However, I feel bad for Gabriella with Maria leaving last minute and Troy couldn\\'t talk after the day she had. Please leave a comment saying what you think and hope for! I love reading all of them. -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 23] ['Hello everyone! Thank you so much to pumpkinking5, Grace and guest for your reviews! Yes guest, I noticed a bit too late that I had misspelt Decathlon, again… I was just tired and didn\\'t read the correction my computer made as I changed the word. So sorry for that. Grace I won\\'t reveal to much but it will get worse before it gets better and yes I think we can blame the cheerleaders for much of it. Excluding Martha of course. I know it might be wrong but I have somewhat stereotyped some of the characters based on movies and TV series. Such as the smart people at school being seen as losers and geeks, the jocks are the popular once, theatre people are somewhat special and mean/manipulating in several ways and the cheerleaders as the other popular group who are \"allowed\" to pick on the groups beneath them. Sort of like a hierarchy/food chain. Also seen in the very first movie before Troy and Gabriela break the status que at East. And yes! You all will learn more about Etrea in their project! That was one of the main reasons why I wanted them to have the project, I did in fact have one about Canada in my social science class two years ago, and through this project I could tell about Etrea and finally pen down the madness that has been going on in my brain ever since this story were created over a year ago! Sorry long intro but hopefully answered questions I am sure some of you had, now onto the story, finally. Saturday 19 th of January Gabriella\\'s POV As Saturday morning came I rolled over in bed and saw the clock just passing nine. Just lying in bed I couldn\\'t hear any noise in the house. Completely quiet. Mom had sent me a text last night saying she was back at the hotel but also to wish me good night. I was rather used to being alone by now but it was still strange to wake up in a house where the only noises heard were made by no-one else than me. I pulled the blanket off me and gathered some clothes before I headed into the bathroom to take a shower. Emerging twenty minutes later I felt more awake and ready for the day. Making my way down towards the kitchen I dialled Taylor\\'s number knowing she should be awake by now. \"Good morning Gabriella,\" Taylor said as she picked up the phone shortly after. \"Good morning. I was wondering if you had plans today?\" I questioned hopefully. \"I\\'m sorry. Mom, dad, me and my little sister are going to visit some relatives up in Santa Fe,\" she apologized. \"No it\\'s okay I understand Taylor. Have fun at your relatives and we\\'ll see each other on Monday?\" I questioned trying my best to sound cheerful. \"Thanks. See you at school,\" Taylor confirmed and with that we both hung up. I let out a small sigh as I placed the phone in my pocket before starting on breakfast which was simply toast. As the clock dragged on throughout the day I was alone and my hopes of having someone over quickly vanished. Troy and Chad had a basketball match while Taylor were visiting relatives. By all means, I could have called someone from the scholastic decathlon team but to be honest I did not have much in common with them besides the academics at school. Most if the frowned upon the fact that I choose to participate in the musical last year despite it crashing with the competition. They did not like me breaking the \"status quo\" at school. What I knew could occupy my mind now was the project about Etrea… Monday 21 st of January Mom had come home last night and offered to drive me to school the next day which was fine by me. Right now I was so nervous to the point that my hand were shaking. \"You are going to nail the test Gabi,\" mom encouraged me as we drove towards East High. \"Thanks, but it doesn\\'t help with the nerves,\" I confessed and she smiled a little taking a quick glance at me before returning her gaze to the road ahead. \"I am sure you are prepared enough and that you will pass with flying colours,\" she told me positively and put on the blinker as she turned the car in on the street the school was located. \"Have a great day at school today and don\\'t worry too much about the test,\" she told me as she stopped outside of the school. I turned towards mom and gave her a small smile. \"Thanks mom,\" I said releasing a breath. My heart beating hard against my chest. \"I will see you tonight,\" I said and closed the car door behind me. I gave my mom a last wave as she smiled at me before driving away. As I pushed open the door to the school building, the clock hadn\\'t turned eight yet. School didn\\'t start for another half an hour so the usually crowded hallways were now empty. My shoes didn\\'t make a sound against the blank floor as I made my way towards the school\\'s guidance counsellor. She had been nice enough to offer me that we could start before school so we could limit the time I had to be out of class. Walking through the quiet halls of East High seemed surreal. Thinking back, I had never seen the halls this quiet… To be honest it was more than a little intimidating. Continuing my walk down the dessert hallway I made my way towards the school counsellor\\'s office. I knocked softly on the open door and Mrs Carver looked up at me with a smile. \"Good morning Miss Montez. Please come in,\" she invited cheerfully. \"Good morning Mrs Carver,\" I said and entered her office, closing the door behind me. \"Are you ready?\" she questioned holding up some papers. I looked at them briefly before meeting her gaze. Her green eyes were relaxed. Comforting to watch. \"As ready as I will ever be,\" I told her with a nod and sat down on the desk that was inside the office. \"I am more than confident that you will do wonderfully on this test Miss Montez. Do you just want to start now and then we should be done by second period?\" she questioned. \"Sounds great,\" I nodded agreeing. \"Great. What we are going to do today is the speaking and listening part. The rest of the test will be based on your English exam. Sounds good?\" she questioned and I nodded silently agreeing. \"Splendid. Let\\'s get going,\" she said and sat down in one of the chairs in front of the desk, starting the test. Troy\\'s POV I was a little nervous on behalf of Gabriella today as she were having her test this morning. I knew she were going to excel because her English was impeccable. But there was still the chance that she misunderstood or misinterpreted the task which could cause her to fail or score low. Why did I suddenly want her to attend Royal College of Etrea so badly? I walked inside homeroom that morning and spotted two of the cheerleaders already there, speaking not so quietly. \"Did you hear the rumours?\" Brittany stated towards Alexandra. \"It says that Gabriella has to take an English test to get into college,\" she snickered and I felt myself getting somewhat angry. What right had they to talk about Gabriella like that? What had she ever done towards them? \"She\\'s at the school\\'s guidance counsellor now taking the test. I saw her on my way to class. I always knew she was special but this just takes it to a whole new level,\" Brittany laughed. I frowned at this because I knew that Brittany did not go that way on her way to class. I knew that her locker was on the other side of the school because I had seen her there several times. \"I mean she can\\'t get accepted to an American college without taking an English test, so she has to apply in another country. Maybe she\\'ll go back to Mexico?\" Brittany said and Alexandra burst out laughing. I couldn\\'t pretend not to notice it any longer. \"Be nice to her,\" I told them calmly as I turned towards them. Both of them looked taken aback and my guess would be that they didn\\'t notice me entering the room. \"She has never done anything towards neither of you so I think you should be a little nice towards her. When it comes to her taking the test, it is just because the one college she is applying to requires her to have it because she speaks another language fluently, which I think is a rather large accomplishment. Cut her some slack because she is much smarter and nicer than you ever give her credit for,\" I finished a little sternly and both of them didn\\'t utter another word. There was no secret around the school that both of them were wishing to date me but, thankfully, they respected that me and Gabriella were together. Did they try to break me and Gabriella up by speaking negatively about her? Deciding to ignore them I found the recent book I were reading for Japanese class back home until either Chad or Taylor came. I didn\\'t notice how much time had passed until I heart Taylor\\'s voice, \"Hey Troy,\" she greeted and I looked up to see the two of them sitting down in their seats. \"Good morning,\" I greeted them both, my eyes scanning the page until I found a place to put the bookmark. \"Umm Troy. I hate to say it but I think you\\'re reading the book the wrong way,\" Chad commented almost carefully and I just started laughing. I looked up to see Taylor gently swat Chad on the shoulder. \"What?\" he questioned quietly looking at his girlfriend. \"If this book had been in English then yes I would have agreed, but this is written in Japanese using hiragana, katakana and kanji. We read from the back to the front,\" I tried to explain showing him the pages of the book. He looked at them confused as to him it probably lines scribbled around randomly. \"Wow, that is weird,\" Chad stated astonished his gaze mesmerized by the signs written in the book. \"And you can read that?\" Chad questioned tearing his eyes away from the page looking at me. \"Yes, just like the English alphabet. Japanese is the second most spoken language in Etrea but also the other official language besides English,\" I shared with them and Taylor looked a little impressed. \"That is quite an accomplishment,\" Taylor stated. \"I don\\'t know about that,\" I said sheepishly. \"As far as I have understood it is the same as you learning Spanish.\" \"I meant to ask, are anyone of you free tomorrow after school?\" Chad questioned suddenly remembering something. \"I thought we could work on our project,\" Chad continued looking at the two of us. \"I am,\" I stated and Taylor shook her head. \"Both me and Gabriella have our AP classes after free period so no sorry,\" Taylor apologized. \"Maybe we can work together in the library?\" Chad questioned looking at me. \"Sure it\\'s just a week until presentation anyways,\" I agreed and the bell rung just as Mrs Darbus walked into the classroom. \"All right settle down, settle down,\" Darbus said and the class somewhat got quiet. \"Today we are continuing to analyse the text you were given last week but first I want you all to remember that the signup sheet for this year\\'s musical is being posted this afternoon by our drama club president miss Sharpay Evans. She has reminded us all that there is only a week of sign up so to all aspiring actors out there, good luck,\" she said making some large hand gesture that she had apparently become known for doing. \"Now we are looking at act two of the play so please turn to page 48,\" she said and started the lecture that seemed to go on forever. Gabriella\\'s POV \"And time is up,\" Mrs Carver said and I put my pen down a little relieved. \"How do you think it went?\" she questioned and I looked at her. \"Good I think. I am defiantly glad it is over because I was so nervous,\" I confessed to her and she gave me a smile. \"I would say you did really well. Now what the examiner think is another story,\" she told me and I couldn\\'t do anything else than laugh a little. Mrs Carver walked around the desk and sat down in her office chair. \"Now,\" she started and typed something on her computer. \"All I need is to print the certificate stating that you have done the test and awaiting the results. Do you want me to send the results directly to the school as I receive them?\" she questioned looking at me. \"If you could that would be great,\" I said putting my pencil case down in my backpack looking at her. \"That is no problem. All I need is your application number and the name of the school,\" she said and found a pad of yellow sticky notes along with a pen. \"I don\\'t have my application number at the moment but could I give it to you tomorrow morning?\" I questioned. \"Absolutely. Now what was the name of the college?\" she questioned. \"Right, Royal College of Etrea. I believe the town was Saint Germains or something like that,\" I said to her and she wrote it down. \"Great. I will send it as soon as the answer comes. You will also receive a copy so you have it for later and there it will also state the expiration date of the test,\" she said and reached over to the printer to get the freshly printed paper. \"Here are the proof that the test has been done and that should be sufficient until further notice,\" she said and signed off on the paper before giving it to me. \"When should I expect the papers to arrive?\" I questioned curiously. \"About three to six weeks but I don\\'t think it should take that long,\" Mrs Carver informed me. \"Now before you go,\" she said and handed me a hall pass and a note to Mrs Darbus stating where I had been. \"Thank you,\" I told her getting the papers. \"Have a nice day,\" Mrs Carver wished me as I walked out of the office and towards homeroom. \"How was it?\" Troy questioned as we were sitting together during lunch. We both wanted some time alone and had made our way to the rooftop garden. I was mostly picking at my salad not eating much. \"Good. I was nervous but I think I did well. The final result should arrive within three to six weeks, however, Mrs Carver didn\\'t think it would take that long,\" I told him. \"How did it go with the basketball match on Saturday?\" I questioned curiously putting my fork down. \"Great, we won so we are even closer towards the championship game. Both me and Chad feel like we could actually end up there. According to Chad it would be the second year in a row which is quite an accomplishment,\" he stated and I nodded remembering from last year. \"How was your weekend?\" he questioned and I faked a smile. He saw right thorough it. \"Good but quiet.\" Lie number one. \"I called Taylor as well but she was going up to Santa Fe to visit some family. I was just alone until mom came home yesterday,\" I shared and he looked at me with a slight frown. \"I thought it was just Saturday?\" he asked confused. \"No mom was away on some business trip in New York so she was gone by the time I came home from school on Friday. She came home yesterday evening,\" I told him. \"You could have told me and you didn\\'t have to be home alone for so long,\" Troy told me and I heard in his voice that he was slightly upset. \"It\\'s all right,\" I said shrugging my shoulders. \"I don\\'t mind it that much…\" Lie number two. \"Call me next time all right?\" he questioned softly and the smile I gave him this time were genuine. \"I will,\" I told him scooting closer. He wrapped his arm around me and I rested my head on his shoulder. \"How did the meeting go?\" I questioned suddenly remembering it. I turned my head so our eyes meet. His blue looking down into my brown. \"It was good. I don\\'t think I ever said why they wanted me in the meeting. The incident involved several people being stabbed with a knife in downtown Iwaki. Luckily it doesn\\'t appear that there are any fatalities but there were several people severely injured. They wanted my opinion on the best course of action for the country and something for a new project. It wasn\\'t all that fun,\" he shared not breaking eye contact throughout the story. \"Oh and Darbus informed everyone about the musical sign-up sheet. Reminding everyone that we only had a week. Do you want to do the musical this year?\" he questioned me and I thought for a split second. It was really fun last year but I had so much going on at the moment. \"I had fun,\" I started and he nodded agreeing. \"But maybe not this year. I just have a lot going on right now with the Scholastic Decathlon team and I agreed to help Taylor with the yearbook,\" I told him. \"I understand. I don\\'t think I will do it either. It won\\'t be the same without you,\" he told me and I felt my heart getting warm. He did it because of me. \"It has been some time since we have gotten the chance to talk uninterrupted just the two of us,\" Troy reflected. \"How are you?\" he simply questioned and I felt myself sink together. \"I am good.\" Lie number three. Hope you all like this chapter! There will be a couple of filler chapters before a grand event in approximately chapter 26. Maybe you can spot the foreshadowing I have used in the past chapters? –Grace, you are really onto something *hint hint*- That is the one I am most concerned about the feedback because you will either love it or hate it. All my thought is with the families and kids after the Santa Fe, Texas school shooting yesterday. RIP -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 24] ['Let me just start by saying how amazing you all are! Thank you so much for your kind words on my authors note that I posted a couple of days ago! To be honest I never anticipated to get the feedback I did but I am over the moon! Thank you so much for your kind words Grace, pumkinking5 and Lia Potter 29. For the past chapter thank you so much to Lia, Grace and insertnamehere123. You guys really catched where I was going with the story and gave me several ideas about the next chapters so thank you so much for that! Now parts of this chapter were quoted from the movie and I think you\\'ll see where ;) Anyways hope you all love the story and I just managed to post this because I am leaving tomorrow! Ahh, so excited! Saturday 26 th of January Troy\\'s POV Last week had been crazy for everyone. Homework, basketball and classes had all been taking up our time. After spending lunch together on Monday, I would be lying if I were not concerned about Gabriella. I do not think she knew that I noticed how little she ate or the smile she was faking. I had seen those type of smiles one too many times. My thoughts were abruptly interrupted by a buzzing sound coming from my phone. I sat up on the couch and reached for the phone. \"Mom said yes. Meet you in half an hour?\" the text from Brie read. \"Great see you then.\" I texted her back and a smile started growing on my face. I missed spending time with Gabriella. I hated the fact that I could not spend time with her last week-end because of the meeting back home. I should not have needed to be attending. Pulling myself from my thoughts I looked around and frowned. I should have tidied up the house before she came. As a result, I had not done the dishes since Thursday. The dishes had been stacked a couple of plates in the sink, while the rest were in the dishwasher., which I had not done anything with either... I started by picking up clothes and other items that needed washing. Sorting through everything that I had collected I even surprised myself. It was more clothes than I anticipated. Sorting through everything I ended up with two different piles. Putting the first load into the washing machine and starting it, I headed into the kitchen. Starting by tidying the sink and loading the dishwasher, it started looking better. Placing the last two pots to dry beside the sink it did not look too bad. Entering the living room, I had papers scattered all over the coffee table. Some were from the meeting last week, while others were from Chad about basketball practice. The rest I had no idea what were. Not having enough time to go through everything I brushed my hair out of my eyes and went to answer the door. \"Hey Gabriella. Come on in,\" I said stepping aside. \"Hey Troy,\" she said giving me a hug. I kissed the top of her head with a smile. She smiled as she took of her shoes and we moved into the living room. \"Please ignore the mess,\" I mentioned vaguely waving my hand in front on the coffee table. \"I don\\'t mind Troy. I know you have been busy,\" she told me smiling softly. \"Thanks. How has everything been?\" I questioned her as we sat down on the couch. \"Stressful. Taylor wanted another meeting with the scholastic decathlon team on Thursday which lasted way longer than it should have. I wasn\\'t home until ten and then I had to research stuff for the project we\\'re having. I didn\\'t even have time to fill out the college application for Royal College of Etrea,\" she shared with me and upon looking at her I truly saw how exhausted she was. \"You could have asked me Brie. I would have helped you with the historiography,\" I told her and she sighed. \"I know but I said I would handle that, and I don\\'t feel right about using you because I know you know all of this,\" she explained looking at me. \"Don\\'t think that Brie,\" I reassured her. \"I feel like it is only natural that you ask me if you have questions about the history. I know it is not easy to find sources and if one first finds it, most of it is so dense and long. Besides, I have already helped Chad with some of what he is going to talk about,\" I continued to tell her and she looked a little relieved. \"Can you share how Etrea was founded because all I can find is how they are tied to China, but I don\\'t see how. You told me how Etrea is heavily influenced by Australia and Japan then I am questioning how China came into the picture,\" she said obviously frustrated and I smiled a little. \"Well not many know this story but once upon a time several hundred years ago during the 1350\\'s Etrea didn\\'t exist but were an island belonging to China named Taiyang dao meaning Sun Island,\" I started to tell her the story I know all too well. \"Taiyang dao used to belong to the Chinese city with the same name but today the city is the one remaining. Now this story starts in Japan with the 97th Japanese emperor named Noriyoshi. Noriyoshi was the king of Japan and he had a younger brother who were entitled the crown prince. Now king Noriyoshi did not have an heir to the throne despite his age of twenty-three. Therefor it was essential that his younger brother Saki married a woman from the Japanese upper class to ensure a strong bloodline if the king could not get an heir.\" \"However, what Saki had not shared was that he was in love with a woman from Australia he had met while sailing. Saki and the Japanese woman started dating to please their parents which is just how the Japanese culture are. You respect your elders. The two started seeing each other more and more until Saki finally disclosed that he had met someone else in Australia. She was surprised but happy because it turns out that she was really in love with a \\'commoner\\' from the middle class. They ended it on good terms both deciding to pursue their real love.\" I stopped for a bit to see the reaction Gabriella had, and the look of fascination in her eyes were just the same as the one Araya had whenever I told her a story. \"Saki told his brother and he was furious that he had broken it off. Therefor Saki secretly planned his trip to Australia for the next month where he hoped to meet the woman he was in love with. He told his family goodbye in a letter disclosing everything about his love in Australia and his intentions. Saki also stated how he loved them but would not return because of their disapproval on his relationship interest with Eulalia. The crown prince then ventured upon the eleven day long sailing to Australia to start his search for Eulalia. To his luck she had always had this fascination of ships and were regularly seen wandering around the harbour talking to sailors or watching ships come and go. Just an hour after they had arrived they had found each other and planned their escape.\" \"Back in Japan the royal family had received news that the two had found each other and they immediately sent word to the Australian government. This was to no use as the two were long gone by then. The young couple fled to China and were settled on the island of Taiyang dao. They married and got a couple of kids and their story became really known amongst the population of Taiyang dao.\" \"Only five years after their arrival the population of Taiyang dao did not share the same views of what was best for the country as China did and they wanted a change. The people started protesting and right in the centre was the couple who fled their own countries Saki and Eulalia. After eight years of fighting the Chinese dynasty they finally gave Taiyang dao up and the country was re-named to Etrea. The people of the newly founded Etrea were so happy about the battle Saki and Eulalia first had fought home and now in Etrea that they asked them to lead the country until further notice. They both accepted and no more than six months later they learned that the Saki was actually the Japanese crown prince. So at this point Etrea became a monarchy because they did not have faith in a government or a dynasty. So as the monarchy of Etrea continued for centuries it is essentially the story of how my family came to power in Etrea. Only short of hundred years ago it was decided that Etrea were given what other people would classify as a government but we really see them as the King\\'s advisors to run different sectors like I talked about during Christmas,\" I told her. \"Wow. I would never have imagined that,\" she told me stunned. \"That is quite an enchanting story about how they came to power because of love,\" she continued. \"I know, I loved hearing the story as a child thinking it was a fairy-tale. It seems rather silly now thinking that it was a fairy-tale,\" I said as memories flooded my mind. \"No I won\\'t say that,\" Gabriella defended. \"It truly seems like a fairy-tale.\" Monday 28 th of January \"All right everyone. Settle down,\" Darbus started just after the bell had rung. She rose from her extravagant chair that had been placed on the small stage. \"I know we are all excited about the Wildcats win this weekend securing them a spot in the final making them play top to bottom,\" Darbus said and I looked down to see a note from Brie. Meet me on the roof during free period. XOXO Brie the note read and lipstick stains from her kissing the note. I leaned back and looked at Brie, as she gave me a sweet smile. \"That will be back to back Mrs. D,\" Chad corrected the teacher and I smiled at him. \"Whatever the case it was a grand slam,\" she dismissed subtly. \"Well done,\" she said to a class who were laughing quietly. \"Great job Wildcat,\" I barely heard Taylor whisper to Chad. \"And now,\" Darbus moved on down the classroom. \"our student body president and co-editor of the year book, miss Taylor McKessie has some important announcements. Taylor\" Darbus said and stepped to the side in the back of the classroom. Taylor cleared her throat quietly and stride over to the blackboard. Taylor moved the blackboard to the side revealing the notes on it. \"Senior trip committee meets tomorrow and reports Thursday to prom committee, which is headed by Martha.\" Taylor said using her pointer to point towards Martha. She showed everyone the poster and smiled. The whole design turned out beautiful. \"You guys can pick up your tickets from her.\" Taylor said her whole voice becoming softer and dreamier as she walked up towards the front. \"This year\\'s theme is The Last Waltz. But don\\'t be the last,\" Taylor snapped and slammed her pointer in Chad\\'s desk. I immediately sat up straight as I got the feeling that she had barely missed the back of my head… \"to pick up your tickets.\" She finished with a subtle spin as she was now facing the class. \"Graduation committee convenes Monday following year book planning. Picture deadline is on Thursday and finals study groups alter with all of the above. Questions?\" Taylor said moving her pointer around as if she were at the back of the class showing the points once again. \"Yeah,\" Chad said leaning forward on his desk. \"What\\'s the lunch special in the cafeteria?\" Chad askes seriously and the whole class laughed rather loudly. \"New York deli,\" Taylor said coldly with a smirk. \"Ohhh,\" the whole class said and I turned to look at him, but he slumped down in his chair. \"Anyone else?\" she questioned ignoring what had just happened. \"Moving on,\" Darbus interrupted and walked up to grab the stick from Taylor. \"Ms Sharpay Evans, four-term president of the drama club spring musical report,\" Darbus said and smiled. \"Well with prom, finals everyone is so busy, I was thinking I\\'d select something very modest to perform.\" She said sweetly as she rose from her desk looking at the class briefly before turning towards their teacher. \"Oh! Perhaps even a one-woman show.\" Sharpay exclaimed and Darbus looked intrigued as she held her tea cup. Looking at the class, most were excited while Ryan seemed shocked. \"Oh,\" Kelsi said and almost threw herself over the clipboard on her desk. \"A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?\" Darbus questioning concern all over her face. \"Um… No…\" she started slowly moving towards her teacher as she never took her eyes off the sheet. \"We\\'re actually doing pretty well,\" she says scribbling names as she is delivering the list to Darbus. \"Well, well, well. Almost the entire Homeroom.\" Darbus said overjoyed as Kelsi sunk down in her seat. Wait , almost the entire homeroom? I never put my name on that list… Everyone was looking at Kelsi as Sharpay stomped her foot in the ground before sitting down. \"How inspiring!\" Darbus theatrically says looking at everyone again. \"I will happily see all of you at free period to discuss the show.\" I turned towards Gabriella confused to see her shaking her head \"And to make a very special announcement,\" she finished just as the bell rung and Kelsi scrambled to collect her stuff to get out of the classroom. Darbus gently tossed the basketball to Chad and he easily caught it as we all followed Kelsi out of the classroom and towards the auditorium. \"All right everyone today is the day. We are going to hear some fascinating presentations about Etrea, Australia, New Zealand and Canada,\" Mr. Howie told us that afternoon. \"Let\\'s just start with the presentations, shall we? Now I have written the country on a piece of paper and we are going to pick one at the time so the first one out,\" he said and picked up a white piece of paper. I was nervous. I wanted to be first but then again not. \"Etrea,\" he announced looking at us and I felt somewhat relived. Okay, we can do this. Chad, Taylor, Gabriella and myself walked up to stand in front of the class. \"Hi, our project is about Etrea which is a rather large country situated in the North Pacific Ocean just north west of the small island Guam.\" Chad started the presentation and I took a quick look at the teacher who seemed genuinely interested. \"Etrea is ranked as the 6th largest country in the world with an area of 7 735 300 square kilometres. In terms of population, Etrea is the 10th largest country with over 128 million people and a population density of 16.5 per square kilometre. The capital is named Iwaki and is the largest town. The second largest town is Saint Germains which is a student town with up to 90% of the population being students at the various colleges there. The national bird is the owl and it is commonly seen all over Etrea,\" Chad said finishing his part about geography and such. \"Etrea is a country heavily influenced by culture and traditions from both Japan and Australia which we will come back to but first some background information. Etrea used to be an island belonging to China in the 14th century. The Japanese crown prince and an Australian woman fell in love and fled Australia. They were situated on the island of Taiyang dao and settled down there. Several years later the population did not see eye to eye with the Chinese dynasty and they wanted a change. After years of protesting, they became independent and the couple were asked to rule the country due to their engagement in the separation. As it became known that he was the Japanese crown prince it became natural that Etrea became a monarchy which it still is today,\" Gabriella told the class. It felt weird to hear this story being spoken out loud in the class knowing that if people investigated furthered into it they could expose me. I did tell Brie that she could use the story despite her hesitation and we agreed not to be as detailed as I had been to her. \"Etrea does not have an official national day such as we have the 4th of July in America but they do have something similar. The festival is named the Flower Blossom festival. It is usually celebrated in the first week in May when the flowers and cherry blossoms are blooming. This is because the first King and Queen of Etrea married the day the flowers blossomed and they wanted to keep the event rather than the date. The festival is meant to give good luck to the people and the country and in later years some people have argued that the festival has become more of a superstition than an actual tradition. However, everyone who has celebrated it since May of 1368 is disagreeing which is the majority of the population,\" Gabriella finished her part about the history and sent a glance at me. \"As stated Etrea is a monarchy but they differ from a lot of the monarchies that are seen around the world today. Etrea is an absolute monarchy which means that the king holds all the power of the country and makes all the decisions. At the same time, they are a hereditary monarchy which means that the firstborn in the family will eventually inherit the throne. However, there hasn\\'t been born a female heir since the early 1800\\'s. The current King and Queen are Alexander and Amelia while the crown prince and princess are Lucille and Jack. They have one son, but he tends to stay away from the media attention.\" I barely paused looking at the class before I continued. \"The official language spoken in Etrea is English and Japanese due to the proximity and influence of the countries. Also, the history plays a vital role when the official language was determined. However, the majority of the population speaks English as their native language. About 20 percent, which equals about 26 million people, of the population, have Japanese as their native language or moved to Etrea from Japan.\" I shared with them. I didn\\'t know if you could find that information online, but it would be rather easy to blame it on me being from Etrea… \"One unique thing about Etrea is the health care and benefits.\" Taylor started looking up from her tiny note card. \"Every child is offered free vaccination up until the age of eighteen while all children under the age of sixteen receive almost free healthcare including doctor and dental care. After the child turns sixteen they have put a limit on how much one should spend before the government again pays for the healthcare. In terms of general hospitalization due to surgery the patient only pays for some specialized treatments and such. Hospitalization due to childbirth is also paid for by the government.\" \"Now the question is how can they afford to do such? Well, everyone pay taxes based on their income and these taxes alone financials all of the benefits and no-one is excluded from receiving these benefits.\" \"Etrea shares most of the same education system as we do in America. Children start in day-care when they are between one and one-and-a-half-year-old. They start primary school the year they turn six and continue on from first through seventh grade. In grade 8, they start middle school which lasts for three years and they move on to high school in grade 11. High school is only two years but in return, they have some of the best-educated students in the world. Ninety-eight percent of college graduates are hired within six months of graduation.\" Taylor continued on and to be honest I was impressed by the details she had found. I didn\\'t even know these numbers existed online. \"Etrea has quite a large military which supports various operations across the world,\" Chad started on his final part. \"Despite the large population Etrea has enforced conscription but at the moment that is only applying to men. This does not mean that there are no women in the military, quite contrary in fact. The latest numbers that we found stated that twenty percent of the enlisted people were female. Salaries in Etrea differ a lot from America. They don\\'t have a set minimum wage but they do have certain lists that is a requirement for how much they are being paid. Due to this under one percent of the population is below the poverty line which is one of the best results around the world.\" Taylor finished. \"Etrea is quite a fertile land which grows and export several different types of fruits and vegetables. Because of the varied climate, Etrea is ideal to grow plants such as watermelons, melons, citruses including oranges, lemon and lime. The common factor is that these need warm weather but dislike cold temperatures. Apples, banana, carrots and such fruits and vegetables like the more average temperatures such as what we have here in Albuquerque.\" Chad concluded our whole project. The class clapped politely and Mr. Howie smiled. \"Well done, that was very informative. Next up is Canada,\" he said and the next group went up to present. That was it! Love to read your feedback and I am sorry to say that I am uncertain when the next chapter will come because I will be away for the next two weeks. No worries I will probably try and type something on the next chapter on my Ipad. Hope everyone have a fantastic summer! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 25] ['Thank you so much Grace and Pumkingking 5 for your encouraging reviews! I realised that the reviews from my last author\\'s note did not get deleted therefore users who were logged in could not post a review. I had a wonderful time in America and it was so exciting to look around New York and Washington D.C along with meeting family. I am not super happy about how this chapter turned out but I got tired of editing and re-writing this. The next couple of chapters are already written they just need some editing and I should be able to have a chapter up maybe next weekend. Hopefully you all like this chapter and to be honest I feel bad for Gabriella… Hope you all enjoy! Thursday 31 st of January 2008 Gabriella\\'s POV I looked over at the text from Troy once more that morning, rubbing sleep out of my eyes. Troy: Hey Brie, Sorry but I won\\'t attend school tomorrow. Don\\'t feel good… Just sick or something like that. Love you and hopefully see you soon. Xoxo I closed my phone with a small sigh as I shoved it into my backpack before making my way downstairs. \"Good morning mi hija,\" mom said as I walked into the kitchen. \"Good morning mom,\" I answered as I put my bag down by the door. Moving further into the kitchen I opened the cupboard grabbing a bowl. I grabbed the carton of milk from the fridge as mom finished preparing her breakfast. \"So Troy coming today?\" Mom questioned buttering the bread. I looked up from the cereal with the spoon halfway up towards my mouth. \"No,\" I said putting the spoon in my mouth, chewing the cereal. \"He texted me last night said her was sick,\" I told her as I chewed on another spoonful of cereal. \"All right. I have to leave but make sure you watch the time,\" she told me putting the knife in the dishwasher. \"I will,\" I told her as she closed the door of the dishwasher. \"Have a good day at school and I will see you tonight,\" mom said as she moved and gave me a kiss on top of my head. \"Thanks mom see you later,\" I told her as I heard her pick up her car keys from the hallway. \"Bye,\" mom called out before the door closed. I let out a sigh as I placed the spoon in the bowl not really hungry any more. Did I just eat to please the people around me? My gaze was down in the bowls as I watched the cereal get more and more soggy. I was not really looking forwards to going to school today because I knew today would be a shitty day. How I knew already? Troy would not be there. I had already figured everything out. Whenever Troy wasn\\'t there, or anyone on the basketball team, the cheerleaders would start talking crap about me right in front of me. Long gone were the days when there was a rumour about you around school. All right, that was not too bad because it was well, just a rumour. But when someone was talking negatively about you right in front of you then it suddenly became a whole lot worse… I could just skip school. That would be an easy solution. The idea played in my mind but there was this rational side of me who argued that I didn\\'t need to start skipping school now. I didn\\'t want to ruin my chances of getting accepted at RCE… I didn\\'t have the biggest hope to begin with so why ruin the little hope I had about my great attendance? I just had to take it and make it through today and hopefully everything would be good tomorrow. Hopefully. Right, there is always tomorrow to look forward, I reminded myself and took a deep breath. I rose from the counter and picked up my bowl drinking the milk before dumping the now soggy cereal, placing the bowl in the dishwasher and looked at the clock. Just in time for school. I picked up my bag and walked into the hallway to put on my shoes before leaving the house, locking the door behind me. It started as soon as I entered the school building. The cheerleaders were standing in a group whispering and laughing amongst themselves. Walking past them to reach my locker I heard them talking about me. \"Look there she is, and Troy is not with her. Maybe he finally dumped her,\" one of them said but I tried my best to ignore them. I knew the truth. \"Maybe he finally got to his sense and learned that he shouldn\\'t date one of the geeks,\" another one snickered as I walked out of earshot of them. I took a couple of deep breaths to try and compose myself in the hopes of stopping the tears that were pressing on. It didn\\'t help. I felt the salty liquid start escaping my eye and I were quick to wipe it away as I opened my locker. My eyes just stared at the books standing there as my vision got clouded by tears that I didn\\'t allow to fall. I didn\\'t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me cry. \"Good morning Gabriella,\" I heard Tylor\\'s cheerful voice before the click as her locker opened. For once I was relieved Taylor didn\\'t have her books either. She didn\\'t have to see my face yet. \"Good morning,\" I told her, surprising myself at how steady my voice was. I furiously wiped away the last tears that were pooling in my eyes. \"Do you have plans during free period?\" she questioned casually as she closed her locker with a small thud. \"Um no…\" I answered vaguely before finding my geography book. \"Will you help me with the yearbook? I have some different layouts I wanted to run by you. See what works best,\" she explained her voice so hopeful. \"Yeah,\" I told her softly as I closed my locker door finally turning towards her. She studied my face, frowning a little. \"Is something wrong?\" she questioned concerned. \"No I am fine,\" I lied brushing it off. \"All right…\" Taylor stated not fully believing me. \"We should head to class before we\\'re late,\" Taylor said as she grabbed my wrist, practically dragging me to class. We were both early to class and sat down in our usual seats. Both in the middle of the classroom. As the warning bell sounded more and more students poured into the classroom taking their seats. I felt lucky to have geography this morning. Somehow none of the cheerleaders were in this class. I could be left alone for now… Seeing as more and more students walking into the classroom they seemed to be looking at Taylor and me. If Taylor could so easily see that I had been crying what would the others think? Right now I did not want to face the world. Why couldn\\'t I just crawl back to bed and escape everything? The next best thing was to just keep my head down pretending to read in my book. In the distance I heard the teacher enter the classroom and starting his lecture. Today was not a day I managed to focus on anything. I was reading the same sentence over and over again as my thoughts were running wild. I had all of these questions about why everyone choose to pick on me. What had I ever done towards any of them? It wasn\\'t exactly my fault that Troy and I started dating. He asked me and I said yes. At that time, I had no idea who he was or what it would mean… \"Gabi,\" Taylor said and I snapped out of my thought. \"Hm?\" I questioned turning towards her. She was standing there with her books in her hand looking down at me. \"It\\'s free period,\" she stated and it was then I fully realised that the classroom was empty. \"Oh,\" I said and hurried to close the book and shove it into my backpack. \"You said something about the yearbook?\" I questioned as I lead her out of the classroom. \"Um, yes. But there is something I want to talk about first. Can we find somewhere quiet?\" she questioned me and the look on her face were worrying me… Finally, we found a quiet corner in the school and we sat down together. \"So what were so urgent?\" I questioned and she just looked at me. \"Oh Gabi,\" she said shaking her head slightly. \"You.\" \"Me?\" I questioned baffled. \"What about me?\" I questioned confused. \"What happened this morning? I saw you crying when we stood by the lockers and again during class just now.\" \"And don\\'t tell me it wasn\\'t anything because we both know it was,\" Taylor told me sternly and I just sighed. \"It was just…\" I trailed off not meeting her eyes. I knew she were looking at me. \"Just a stupid comment made by the cheerleaders. That\\'s all,\" I told her and she crossed her arms across her chest. \"There seems to be more to it than that.\" Taylor claimed her voice serious. \"I don\\'t know okay?\" I said with a sigh dragging a hand through my hair. \"I am just having a bad day and there is a lot going on all right? Somehow they seem to be after me especially when Troy is not around and then I got a message from him last night that he was sick,\" I explained. \"Well I guess it\\'s good that Troy is almost always with you?\" she questioned playfully nudging me in the side. I had to smile at that because to some extent it was true. \"Yeah I guess,\" I said not revealing how many ways they found to pick on me… February, Saturday 2 nd Mom were leaving for the airport again… \"You\\'re going to be all right alone?\" mom questioned me again grabbing her coat. \"Yeah,\" I answered softly giving her a small smile. I felt my stomach twist at the thought of her being away again. \"I know this is not ideal but I promise you after this there will be a lot less traveling,\" she said and walked towards me. \"You said that about moving also,\" I pointed out to her softly and she sighed. \"I know Gabriella and I am sorry about that. I never thought we would be moving so much, but I am hundred percent certain that we are not moving until August,\" Mom told me putting on her coat. \"But you mentioned something about moving in mid-May?\" I frowned and I were even more confused by her increasing smile. \"I forgot to tell you but I got the confirmation yesterday that we are staying. That whole plan got cancelled thank god,\" mom said and I hadn\\'t felt so relieved in a long time. \"That\\'s wonderful,\" I smiled genuinely. \"Well I should get going. Do not hesitate to call me at any time Gabriella. If you can\\'t get hold of me leave a message or send me a text,\" she instructed. \"I will mom,\" I told her and she moved forwards to give me a hug. \"Take care and I will be back before you know it. I love you mi hija.\" \"I love you too mom. Have a safe flight,\" I told her as I followed her into the hallway. \"Thank you Gabi. See you soon,\" mom said and with a last smile she walked out to door. Sunday I rolled over in my bed and looked at my clock. Twelve, noon. I had just been laying in my bed awake for the past several hours. Mom had sent me a text late last night saying she had landed safely and reminded me once more to call her if there should be anything. I looked down at myself and felt kind of sorry. I had fallen asleep in yesterday\\'s clothes and not been bothered to get out of bed despite being awake for the past four or five hours. Glancing from the clock and towards my cell phone, which were resting on the nightstand beside my clock, I picked it up. I needed a reason to get out of bed. I opened my phone and clicked into my list of contacts. I flickered through it until I found Troy\\'s phone number and my thumb hovered over the green call button. I pressed the red button and closed my phone again. He shouldn\\'t be the reason I should get out of bed… He was sick and had other things to worry about. More important things than me. Hope you all enjoyed this delayed chapter! As Pumkingking 5 said in her review she said one thing she liked about the presentation and Etrea were that everyone received healthcare. That was inspired by the healthcare system in Norway where a lot of our income is going to taxes but we have amazing health benefits. So long story short, Etrea is somewhat based on the wealth system that we have in Norway but they also differ somewhat. As far as I have understood the healthcare system, is a little like what Bernie Sanders tried to do in America. Hope that gave you a better understanding and reviews are always appreciated! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 26] ['Hey everyone! Thank you so much to Grace, Pumkinking 5 and Lia for your reviews on the last chapter. Yes, Lia Etrea were supposed to be a smaller island but then I figured out hey what would happen if it were larger and several ideas started playing in my head, so yeah. That\\'s how that escalated, haha! This chapter isn\\'t too cheerful either and a warning already now, the next couple of chapter won\\'t be pretty either. I am thinking about doing a quick re-write on the next chapter so it doesn\\'t get to dark… As it is now it should not conflict with the T rating but I am concerned about what you as readers will think about the event. School starts Monday the 20 th for me but most of the next couple of chapters have been written and school should not take up as much of my time as last year. Finishing with all my thoughts and warnings here is chapter 26! Monday 4th of February Troy\\'s POV It was Monday evening and I were on my way towards her house. We had briefly spoken on the phone earlier and despite her not having said it, I just knew she didn\\'t have a good day at school. I had delayed my visit slightly planning my surprise and waiting for the worst of the rain to stop. Turning onto her street, the pavement was dark and the previous rain were illuminated by the dim street lights. I spotted her house and noticed that Maria\\'s car wasn\\'t parked anywhere. That would most likely mean two things, she was either working late or traveling again. Believe me, Maria were a great woman but I was starting to question if she noticed how much it hurt Gabriella every time she had to travel or work late. Not wanting to take any risks about possibly encountering Maria I walked into the garden. Looking up towards her balcony the lights were on and the curtains closed. The light from her room reflected the small puddles and water that had been collected on several of the tree branches. I knew it were risky what I were about to do, but to me it was worth it. Quickly I tied the rope to the tree and secured the basket before I called her. \"Hey Wildcat,\" her cheerful voice greeted me. \"How are you feeling?\" she questioned concerned. \"Hey Brie. I feel better but look outside your door,\" I told her and shifted my gaze up towards her balcony. I saw the door being pushed open and she stepped outside wearing a beautiful simple purple dress. \"Pizza delivery,\" I said taking the phone away from my ear as she hung up. \"Shh,\" she mock hushed me as she were laughing. \"Margherita pizza just the way you like it,\" I told her more quietly as I showed the basket that were attached to the rope. She walked over to the rope and started hoisting the basket up towards her balcony as I climbed up being careful of slipping on the wet branches. As soon as I put my feet down on the white wood Gabriella looked on me, her face filled with concern. \"Troy,\" she started her voice soft. \"You need to be careful with your arm, and you\\'re sick,\" she told me brushing her thumb on my cheek. \"I feel better Brie I promise,\" I reassured moving forward to kiss the top of her head. As my eyes locked with hers I saw the relief and the smile playing on her lips. \"Come on,\" she said taking my hand as we walked inside her bedroom. She closed the door behind me and put the basket down on the floor. I opened it and took out the folded picnic blanket, placing it on the ground. \"I\\'m just going to grab something,\" Gabriella said and walked out of the room. I heard her walk down the stairs as I laid out the various items on the blanket. The last thing I did as I heard Gabriella walk up the stairs were to place the flowers between us. \"Mmm. It smells so good,\" Gabriella said as she entered the room with a lighter in hand. She moved around the room to light the candles that were placed on her desk and bookshelf. She placed the lighter on her dresser before she sat down opposite of me. \"What is a dinner complete without chocolate covered strawberries?\" I questioned taking out the bowl. \"How did you know Margherita pizza were my favourite?\" she questioned stretching to take a piece. \"Just a lucky guess,\" I said with a smile and took a piece for myself. \"I am just joking. You told me some time ago.\" \"It\\'s so sweet of you to remember such small details,\" Gabriella gushed. \"Well I don\\'t think it is such a small detail to remember.\" \"It\\'s been so long since we have spent time together. I missed just being us,\" Gabriella told me with a smile. \"I know what mean. I had never anticipated basketball being so crazy when Chad talked about us getting to the finals again,\" I said and reached forward to the glass taking a sip. \"You know that if you had called me a little earlier you didn\\'t have to climb the tree. You could have just used the front door,\" she said with a smile. \"I didn\\'t know what your mom would have thought about it,\" I admitted to her as she sighed putting her pizza down. She looked down on the ground, her whole frame sinking. \"Mom isn\\'t home right now,\" she admitted quietly. \"She should be home a little later though,\" she said avoiding the question. \"I\\'m sorry to hear that Brie. She seemed to be gone a lot now,\" I remarked and Gabriella nodded sadly. I scooted a little closer taking her hand, squeezing it gently. Looking at her eyes tears were glimmering and they held so much sadness while her smile showed love. \"Hopefully it should get better soon. It\\'s not long before summer break and hopefully we could spend some time together before I move away for college or mom moves again,\" she said and a single tear glimmered in her eye. I used my thumb to gently brush away the tear that left her eye. \"What do you mean?\" I questioned a little confused. \"Mom has always moved a lot due to work and when we moved to Albuquerque just after New year\\'s eve last year she promised that we would stay until I graduated.\" She stopped and I understood what she meant. \"So you don\\'t know where she will move when you are finished with high school,\" I finished and she nodded. \"I guess that is part of the reason why I have applied for various schools. I know that mom will know approximately where she is moving by the time I have to make a decision,\" she confessed. \"Where have you applied?\" I questioned out of pure curiosity. \"Yale outside of New York, Stanford in California, Royal college of Etrea, University of Albuquerque, New York university and University of Washington,\" she listed up. \"They are quite spread,\" I observed and she nodded. \"Does it have anything to do about your mom moving?\" I questioned curiously and she nodded. \"Yeah. I applied for a lot of colleges on either coast because that is most likely where she will be relocated. Before we moved to Albuquerque we stayed in Iowa so statistically speaking…\" she trialled off. \"Luckily that is still several months away,\" I reminded her trying to cheer her up. \"You\\'re right. For all I know she could still end up staying in Albuquerque,\" Gabriella said and I saw at once she was not even convincing herself. \"Do you like strawberries?\" I questioned showing her the bowl really trying to distract her. \"Oh that looks so good,\" she gushed reaching forward to take one. \"Mmm that was so good,\" she said putting the end on her plate. We were just sitting there talking and having fun sharing the strawberries well into the evening. \"Do you want the last strawberry?\" I questioned looking into the bowl. \"You can take it,\" she said taking a quick glance into the bowl. I picked it up holding it in front of me. \"This might be the best strawberry you have ever tasted but you wouldn\\'t know,\" I teased and looked at her as she laughed. \"Well then,\" she said and reached forward to take a bit. \"You were right Wildcat,\" she said as I ate the rest of it. \"It was great to spend time with you again Wildcat,\" she said as we were standing outside on her balcony. She had asked if I wanted to use the front door but I thought about Maria coming home at any time. \"I really enjoyed it Brie. Call me if there should be anything all right?\" I questioned her and she nodded. \"I will. Goodbye Wildcat,\" she said taking my hand. \"Goodbye?\" I questioned surprised. She gave me a small smile stepping closer laying a hand on my neck, brushing her fingers through my hair. \"I meant goodnight,\" she told me softly and I leaned in to kiss her but she turned her head away so I kissed her cheek. \"I love you Troy.\" \"I love you too Gabriella,\" I said as I climbed over the railing and down on the ground starting the walk home. Thursday 7th It was Tuesday morning and English were just finished. Taylor were sick and had cancelled today\\'s scholastic decathlon meeting during free period. Coincidently the teacher for Gabriella\\'s class of choice had become ill as well and they had decided just to cancel it. Of course Gabriella had her AP classes at the end of the day that she had to attend. At this point Gabriella were now walking around the halls of East High to pass time. None of her friends were out of their classes leaving Gabriella alone. Walking into the girl\\'s bathroom she locked herself into a stall and it wasn\\'t long before she heard voices. \"Ugh. I am like so pissed off!\" she heard one of them say and she immediately recognized it as Brittany one of the cheerleaders. \"Why that Brittney?\" the other voice said and Gabriella presumed that being Alexandra. Her follower who did everything that Brittany asked her to. \"Who Alex, who,\" Brittany corrected her glaring at her friend. \"And it is that Montez girl. She is just a geek!\" Brittany spat and Alexandra frowned a little looking at her friend. \"Think about it! How could she get someone like the Troy Bolton? The number one jock and most popular boy at East High. Just to top it all off he is the future king of a whole freaking country! She means nothing,\" Britney spat and Gabriella felt tears burn in the back of her eyes. \"I did some research and look at this,\" Brittany said and Gabriella heard the ruffling of a paper. \"No way,\" Alexandra claimed. \"Uhu, it\\'s true. Second in line for the throne. Look who have been lying to all of us.\" Brittany remarked sassily. For the second time within the two short hours she had been at school someone had made a comment behind her back about her relationship with Troy. The exact same thing as the day before… \"Anyways have you done the algebra?\" Brittney asked her voice fading as they walked out of the bathroom. Walking out of the stall she turned to look at herself in the mirror which turned to be a big mistake. As she watched the first couple of tears broke free, the rest followed in a never ending stream. Gabriella steadied herself on the sink while she sank towards the floor and her hands falling towards the tiled floor. She began to cry with the force as if someone had just punched her in the gut. Several minutes later the tears stopped and she wiped her sore eyes slowly getting up from the floor. She brushed herself off and dared to look at herself once more in the mirror. The girl that looked back at her she didn\\'t recognize. Her usual tanned skin was now dull and slightly pale. Her once lively eyes were missing the spark and red from all of the crying. Her cheekbones were sticking out more and she was surprised that her friends haven\\'t made a comment about it. Maybe they hadn\\'t noticed or felt like they couldn\\'t say anything… She splashed some cold water on her face before walking back into the hallway ready to cover it up again. Walking back towards her locker she tried to be productive and found her chemistry book. As she spun the combination and opened the door a white piece of paper fell out and landed on the floor by her feet. She didn\\'t even have to look at to know that it was from Brittany, so she just curled it up and threw it into the locker along with the others she had received. Closing the door with a small thud, she slide down the door and sat down. The energy that were left in her seemed to drain away after everything that had happened. Pulling her knees up to rest her forehead on she only looked up when someone touched her shoulder. \"Hey Gabi!\" Kelsi\\'s cheerful voice was sounded as she sat down beside her friend. \"Hi Kelsi. No class?\" Gabriella questioned confused looking at her. \"No I were in the auditorium writing something for the musical but the piano were being tuned,\" she explained. \"How are you doing?\" she asked. \"All right,\" Gabriella lied and Kelsi looked concerned at her. \"Rough day?\" she continued looking at her friend. \"Something like that,\" Gabi mumbled. \"There has been a lot going on,\" she continued. \"You want to talk about it?\" Kelsi asked not looking away from her. \"No it\\'s okay,\" Gabriella assured Kelsi, not really knowing how to tell her friend about all of this. \"All right. Remember that I\\'m here if you need to talk or there is anything,\" Kelsi said sensing that she wanted to be alone. \"Thank you,\" Gabriella said giving her a genuine smile for once. \"See you at lunch?\" she questioned standing up. \"Sure,\" she replied and Kelsi walked away giving her a small wave. \"Hey Gabriella,\" Kelsi said as Gabriella approached her table during lunch. \"Hi,\" Gabriella said as Kelsi hurried to collect her notes and books. \"I thought I had to eat alone,\" she said putting them away. \"Nah. Thought I could join you. Both Chad and Troy are at practise so. Tried to convince them to eat but…\" Gabriella said with a small smile. \"They\\'ll come around. The championship game isn\\'t that far away so I understand that they want to get all the practice they can,\" Kelsi reasoned as Gabriella sat down with her tray. \"Yeah, Troy has been joining them despite his wrist. He is hopeful that it will heal enough so he can play if they qualify,\" Gabriella told her taking a bit out of her salad. \"Did the piano turn out all right?\" she questioned and watched the grin rise on her friends face. \"Yes! It sounds so much more beautiful now. That reminds me, we should figure out when we can practice with everyone. The music is finished but I want to hear your opinion. Do you have time this week or next perhaps?\" \"Yeah. Maybe free period on Thursday?\" Gabriella questioned. \"That would be great,\" Kelsi agreed with a smile. \"I can\\'t wait to see what you all think about this musical,\" she gushed and smiled. That was it! I know I said it wouldn\\'t be pretty and I feel so bad for Gabriella, despite me deciding to write this... oh well..., but there was some fluff. I swear to you all it will get better in the next chapter or the chapter after that depending on how long I want them to be. Oh and also this has to be one of my fastest updates to date so I am sorry to say don\\'t expect them to come this quickly. I had hoped to update on the 25th but as it turns out we are going to Sweden again so I will see what happens. Your thoughts, ideas and opinions are always welcomed and I regularly check both reviews and my PM\\'s ;) Again thank you so much for all your support you guys are all amazing! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 27] ['*Warning* This chapter should not conflict with the T rating currently given but it does mention/show the theme of suicide. Viewer/reader discretion is advised. *Warning* Tuesday, 12th of February Walking inside her house that afternoon it was dark and quiet. Her mother being out of town working, leaving Gabriella home alone. Shutting the front door, she placed her backpack on the kitchen counter before sitting down at the table. Collecting herself after the long day Gabriella started on the mountain of homework that had been piling up since Monday. Finally, at six o\\'clock she put down the pencil and closed her Biology book putting the papers inside. Walking inside the living room, sitting down on the sofa, the events of the day overcame her and she broke down sobbing. After managing to compose herself, all she wanted was to end her misery. Never could she be alone with her boyfriend without hearing the comments, the bullying, the name calling and all of the notes. She looked around downstairs before she walked into the kitchen grabbing a piece of paper and a pen writing a note to Troy and her mother. Folding the paper neatly she wrote the name of her boyfriend on the front before taking the letter with her and made her way upstairs. Placing the letter on her bed, she found her phone, camera and charger. Deciding to make one last entry she turned the camera on and pointed it towards herself. \"Dear diary,\" she started taking a deep breath trying to compose herself. \"For the past weeks I have thought about this decision and it pains me that this is the solution but I haven\\'t found another. It was a hard decision but I\\'m tired of living like this… I love you all and I want you Troy, to remember what I said in the letter. I love you and I think I have since the day we meet. I made these diaries to show my kids one day when they turned eighteen,\" I said and smiled a little giving a small laugh. \"And to be honest after we got together, I hoped that we could show it to our kids but that will not be the case now. If anyone wants to keep these diaries as a memory, please do but move on. Troy I love you and I want you to be happy again. Since you are most likely the first to see this can you tell everyone how much they meant to me? I love you forever Wildcat, and I\\'m sorry for doing this. I\\'ll watch over you all,\" Gabriella finished as tears were streaming down her cheeks for a couple of seconds before she turned off the camera. With a heavy heart and lump in her throat she placed it on her bed along with the other items. Knowing where to find what she needed she walked inside her mother\\'s bedroom, opening her medicine cabinet taking out the bottle of sleeping pills. Inside her own medicine cabinet, she found a box of Advil and took out several pills from both of the containers. She looked around the room and quickly swallowed the pills. As her senses quickly disoriented she felt panic set in. She managed to grab her phone and dialled the number. Troy was sitting in the living room doing some reading to pass one class back home thinking back to the day. He had barely seen Gabriella since that morning, because of how different their schedules were. His phone was ringing and he saw that it was Kelsi. \"Hello,\" Troy said answering his phone. \"Hey Troy, it\\'s Kelsi. I was just wondering if you have talked to Gabriella today?\" she asked and he frowned a little. \"Um not since English. What about it?\" he asked and Kelsi took a deep breath. \"Not that it concerns me or anything, but I think you should call her. She looked pretty upset when I last talked to her. Besides I heard from Martha that Brittney and Alexa had done something. I don\\'t know what though,\" Kelsi told Troy. \"Thanks Kelsi. I will give her a call. See you tomorrow?\" \"Yes, see you,\" she said ending the call. He had just hung up on Kelsi when his phone lit up again. \"Hey Brie,\" Troy said but there was silence. His heart started beating hard inside his chest. \"Troy,\" she hiccupped and all Troy heard were her cries and his own heart thumping inside his chest. \"I made a huge mistake. Please come now,\" she begged and Troy heard in her voice that she was starting to slur. \"Brie what happened?\" he questioned panicked as he hurried to pick up a hoodie before he ran down the stairs, taking two at a time. \"I made a mistake and mom isn\\'t home. Just come,\" she begged through tears. \"I am on my way,\" he told her bolting out the door before the line went dead. \"Brie,\" he said before he looked at the phone and saw that she had hung up. Running the whole way towards her house, the hoodie he had grabbed were not necessary as he was more than warm enough. Thoughts were spinning through his head. \"Mom isn\\'t home…\" she had stated, did that mean she were working late two days in row? He started doubting that and feared that Marie were on yet another business trip. Troy feet were pounding against the pavement as he saw her house in the distance. Getting closer he could not see any lights lit downstairs which worried him even more. Reaching the front door, he pushed the tab down before entering the house and the door closed behind him. \"Brie!\" he yelled out in the dark downstairs. His heart thumped in his ears but otherwise it was completely quiet. \"Brie! Gabriella!\" he called out again but received the same eerie silence. He hurried to look inside the living room and kitchen but they looked untouched. All he found was her backpack placed on the table. Walking back into the hallway he took the stairs two at the times before calling her name again. \"Brie!\" He pushed open her bedroom door seeing gleams of light streaming through the small opening as the door was slightly ajar. Walking inside he stopped dead in his tracks at the sight that meet him. It was like a hard punch in the gut. Just in front of her bed Gabriella laid passed out on the floor, her phone barely 10cm from her open palm. \"Brie,\" he said and rushed beside her dropping to his knees. \"Brie can you hear me?\" he questioned tapping her cheek to see if he could get a response. As she didn\\'t budge he used his index and middle finger placing them on her neck feeling for a pulse. Feeling the steady thumping underneath his fingers, he immediately let out a huge sigh of relief. Reaching into his pocket he took out his phone and dialled 911. \"911 what\\'s your emergency?\" the lady questioned. \"My girlfriend. I found her unconscious. I don\\'t know what happened,\" Troy said feeling the panic set in. \"All right we\\'ll send an ambulance right away. What\\'s the address?\" the dispatcher questioned and Troy told her the address. \"All right what is your name?\" she questioned. \"Troy,\" he answered his eyes looking down at Gabriella. \"Good Troy, the ambulance is on their way. What is the name of your girlfriend?\" she questioned. \"Gabriella Montez. I checked her pulse. It was steady but faint,\" he reported still having his fingers on her neck. \"Good Troy. Do you know what happened?\" \"She called me earlier. Said she made a bad decision and when I came here I found her unconscious,\" Troy reported his eyes looking down her body, observing for any other injuries. \"So you don\\'t know if she has taken anything?\" the lady questioned. \"No I am sorry. She does not appear to have any other injuries,\" Troy reported and he heard the tapping on a keyboard. \"Good, you\\'re doing a great job. Can you tell me her age and date of birth?\" \"She is 17. Her birthday is the 14th of July 1990,\" Troy told her. \"Is there anyone else home? Any of her parents or guardians?\" she questioned. \"Her mother is out of town working I believe. I don\\'t know where, but I think I know how to contact her,\" Troy informed. \"Good I will write that down. All you\\'re telling me now we\\'re sending directly to the ambulance,\" she explained and Troy nodded to himself. \"Can you see or hear an ambulance?\" she questioned Troy just as he heard faint sirens in the distance. \"I think I hear them,\" Troy reported as blue lights lit up the garden and the sound grew louder and louder. \"Are you able to go down and meet them?\" she questioned kindly and Troy looked back at Gabriella. \"Yeah,\" Troy said and got up walking down the stairs. He opened the door just as they stopped and a paramedic opened the door walking round to the back to take out the stretcher. \"They are here now,\" Troy said as the two paramedics rushed towards him. \"All right she is in good hands now Troy. I am going to hang up all right,\" she said. \"Thank you.\" \"I am just doing my job. Goodbye,\" she said as she hung up. \"She is upstairs,\" Troy directed the two paramedics leading them upstairs towards her room. He walked around her but his feet pushed into something. Looking down he picked the item up studying it. It was a clear orange bottle. He turned it and read the label as he sat down on the bed. Looking up he watched as the two paramedics were working on her taking vitals and such. \"Hey there. Heard you were the one who called?\" he questioned and Troy nodded. \"Do you know what happened?\" he questioned Troy giving him his full attention. \"I am sorry I don\\'t. I suspect she might have swallowed this, but I didn\\'t see anything,\" he told the paramedic and handed him the bottle. \"You know how many she took?\" \"I don\\'t. I wish I saw the signs about what was to happen,\" Troy said and the paramedic gave him a sympathetic smile. \"You did all the right things so now it\\'s our time to do the rest,\" he explained. \"Ready for transport,\" the other one said. \"All right,\" the first one said and they expertly moved her onto the lowered stretcher. It was then, when he looked away, that he noticed the folded piece of paper with his name written on it. Reaching forwards, he took it and placed it into his pocket for later. \"Would you like to ride with us to the hospital and possibly answer some more questions?\" the paramedic questioned as they had now raised the stretcher. \"Yes please,\" Troy said as he followed them out to the ambulance forgetting her phone on the bed. Before he knew it she was rolled away at the hospital and he found himself un-able to follow her. Instead he was asked to fill out what he could on the form and give it back to one of the nurses at the nurse station. Looking down at the form it was the basics such as birthday, name, name of parents/guardians, social security etc. He filled out what he knew before turning it in to the nurse. As he sat down again he remembered the letter and reached into his pocket and unfolded it. Dear Troy! When I first meet you, I had no idea would mean this much to me, or become so important to me. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, but by the time you read this it will be to late…. Please know that I want you to be happy again because I know that you are sad at this point, and I never wanted you to feel the grief and sadness you are feeling now, but it has all became too much. On my darkest days you have been there to lighten them up but now it wasn\\'t enough. As much as you have done to help me, you are also a part of my problems… There have been all these rumours around school that you probably know by now and then they started targeting me. I couldn\\'t do it anymore. I couldn\\'t take it anymore. Please tell everyone that I am sorry but I want you all to move forward and be happy. Take the time you need to grieve because I know it\\'s painful, but after that, move forwards and be happy. I will forever love you and know that I will protect you from above. Yours forever Gabriella xoxo Reading the letter, he was in shock. How could it have become this bad? He felt guilty that he hadn\\'t noticed anything and been there to help her. Now she had ended up trying to kill herself. Feeling alone he opened his phone before dialling a familiar number. \"Hello Troy. Is this urgent? I am just on my way to attend a meeting,\" she told her son briefly and Troy felt a lump in his throat. \"Sort of but it is okay. It can wait if you are in a hurry,\" he said but the sadness in his voice gave it all away. \"By the sound of it, you are not ok,\" Lucille observed and Troy nodded to himself. \"It\\'s Gabriella,\" he started almost losing his voice already, \"she um…\" he started getting chocked up. He took a breath before he continued, \"tried to kill herself,\" he hurried to say at the verge of tears. \"Oh sweetheart. Is she all right?\" Lucille questioned him worried and Troy could hear her fast strides. \"I don\\'t know ma. I haven\\'t heard anything. She called me saying she had made a bad decision and once I told her I were on my way she hung up. Once I reached her house I found her on the floor. She was passed out and she wouldn\\'t respond to anything,\" he said and as the image of her haunted him, he started to cry silently. Lucille had only heard her son cry a handful of times, and that mostly being when he got hurt as a child. She knew it was bad if he started crying now. \"Oh sweetheart, hang on a minute,\" she said and there were some noises. \"Summer, can you re-schedule the meeting? Tell them there is a family emergency, thank you.\" \"A family emergency?\" he heard the faint voice of his father. \"Is Troy all right?\" his father voiced concerned. \"Troy is not harmed, there is something else. It is Gabriella I will tell you later,\" Lucille reassure Jack and returned to the phone call with her son. \"I am sure she is going to be all right,\" she tried to reassure him. \"I do not know what to believe now,\" he told his mother honestly sniffling a little. \"Have you heard anything?\" she questioned. \"No.\" \"If you don\\'t hear anything I suggest you go home and try and get some sleep before returning in the morning. I suspect they might have some rules about when to visit?\" she questioned. \"They do,\" Troy confirmed wiping away the tear that were lingering in his eye. \"Do you want me to come pay you a visit?\" she suggested once he didn\\'t say anything. \"I don\\'t know. I feel so lost right now. I don\\'t know what I will do if anything happens to her,\" he confessed drying away the continues tears that ran down his cheek. \"Miss Montez?\" a doctor questioned and Troy stood up. \"You were the one who brought her in?\" he questioned and Troy nodded. \"Well I\\'m afraid there is not much I can say at the moment, other than that they are going to keep a close eye on her. Because of her attempted suicide and a possible depression, we, along with the hospital\\'s psychiatrist, have decided to restrain her at the moment but only until we know more,\" he explained to the young teenager. \"Is she awake?\" Troy questioned. \"No I am afraid not. We don\\'t expect her to wake up until later. When is hard to tell,\" the doctor informed Troy. \"Am I able to see her? Her mom is out of town working and I don\\'t know any way to contact her,\" Troy told the doctor and he thought for a minute. \"Well visiting hours isn\\'t over for another half an hour so I guess I can allow that. She is in room 214. The elevator is over there. Once you are on the second floor make a right down the hallway before taking a left,\" the doctor explained. \"If there should be anything just tell the nurses,\" he finished. \"Thank you so much,\" Troy smiled before making his way towards the elevators. Following the doctor\\'s directions, he found room number 214. He gave a soft knock before he opened the door with a shaky hand. Walking inside the room it was plain white and quite sterile looking. The blinds were shut but it didn\\'t matter as it was already dark outside. Moving his eyes to the only bed in the room there Gabriella laid peacefully. A machine was measuring her heart rate while an IV were attached to her right hand. What caught Troy\\'s attention were the small white cuffs that were on either of her wrists and restrained her to the bed. He walked forward and sat down in the plastic chair beside her bed. He took her left hand and squeezed it ever so gently. \"I am here Brie. I love you,\" he told her using his right hand to stroke it through her hair. He was sitting there in silence not knowing what to say to her. All he could do was to comfort her even though he didn\\'t know if she heard him. Just as he was debating if he should leave he felt her squeeze his hand. \"Brie,\" Troy said standing up looking at her face. \"I am here Brie. You\\'re not alone,\" he told her using his thumb to stroke her cheek. Slowly her eyes fluttered open and her eyes locked with her boyfriends. \"Troy,\" she whispered softly. \"Hey Brie,\" Troy said his voice choked up and tears pooling in his eyes. \"You saved me,\" she stated and tried to move her left arm. \"What?\" she questioned confused as she tried to move her right arm. \"Troy,\" she said fearfully looking at him. \"It\\'s all right,\" he soothed taking both of her hands. \"I am going to get a doctor or something and then I promise I will be back,\" he told her and she nodded slowly. \"All right,\" he said and leaned forward to kiss her forehead before walking out of the room. After quickly explaining to one of the nurse what had happened they soon paged a doctor and together they walked into her room. \"Hello miss Montez I am doctor Smith,\" the doctor greeted her. \"We are going to do some test is that ok?\" Dr Smith questioned and Gabriella nodded. \"Unfortunately your boyfriend has to leave since it\\'s past visiting hours,\" the doctor gently explained. \"Can\\'t he stay?\" Gabriella begged the doctor but Troy interrupted. \"It\\'s all right Brie I will be here in the morning.\" \"Okay,\" she said her voice shakily. \"I love you,\" he said stepping forward to kiss her forehead. \"I love you too,\" she said before he walked out of the room and headed home. As he finally reached his house he felt completely exhausted. The emotions and events overcame him as he collapsed on the couch falling asleep. \"Hello Lucille is this a good time?\" Adrianna questioned looking out the kitchen window as she heard her sister pick up. \"Hello Adrianna it\\'s nice to hear from you. Yes, I have time,\" Lucille said with a smile as she looked at her son asleep on the couch. \"I have a meeting in Iwaki in a couple of days and I were wondering if you wanted to meet and catch up. I hardly see you anymore,\" Adrianna told her sister smiling as Makayla entered the kitchen finding something in the fridge. As she closed the door Makayla frowned at her mother questioning who she was on the phone with. \"Lucille,\" Adrianna mouthed silently to her daughter who made a face and turned to walk back into the living room. \"I would have loved to see you again and I do agree that we hardly see each other anymore but I am sorry I can\\'t make it. I flew to America earlier today. There was something that happened and Troy needed me to come,\" Lucille explained not getting into much detail still knowing her sister would ask. \"America?\" Adrianna questioned baffled. \"Is Troy all right?\" Adrianna questioned concerned. \"Yes I think he is all right at the moment. He doesn\\'t know I am here yet.\" \"But what happened? Obviously there had to be something if he asked you to come,\" Adrianna questioned confused turning her back towards the kitchen door. \"It involves Gabriella. He called me after he had been over at her house and he didn\\'t share all the details but apparently she tried to commit suicide,\" Lucille said releasing a breath as she remembered the state her son was in hours earlier. \"What?\" Adrianna exclaimed shocked. \"Suicide?\" she repeated more hushed turning her back towards the door. \"I am afraid so…\" Lucille trialled off. \"He were the one who found her but what I don\\'t get is that she had called him asking him to come over, and when he reached her house he found her passed out or something. He called the paramedics and they brought her in. The last he told me was that he hadn\\'t seen her,\" Lucille explained to her shocked sister. \"Oh my gosh,\" Adrianna said sinking down on a chair not seeing her daughter standing in the doorway. \"How are Troy coping?\" Adrianna questioned concerned and Lucille were silent for a second while she was thinking. \"I don\\'t know to be honest. He is crushed that something like this happened. If she doesn\\'t make it, it will destroy him. Gabriella were the first one he was serious with. She saw him for Troy and not the title that followed. I understood that once the question about revealing who he was came up. He doesn\\'t really like sharing that aspect of his life and back home he doesn\\'t really have that choice,\" Lucille shared with her sister, her eyes still fixed on her son. \"I can\\'t even begin to imagine Lucille. I am sending all my thoughts and keep me posted,\" Adrianna said taking a deep breath. \"I will Adrianna. I will let you know once I get back home but I doubt it will be before you return,\" Lucille said regretfully. \"No don\\'t think about. It would only be natural for you to be there. Take care,\" Adrianna said as they bid their goodbyes. \"Mom?\" Makayla questioned her mother timidly as she stood at the entrance of the kitchen, tears glimmering in her eyes. \"You heard everything?\" she questioned and Makayla nodded swallowing hard. She moved towards her mother who opened her arms hugging her close. \"Is Troy all right?\" she questioned fearfully, sniffling as the first couple of tears fell. \"Oh honey.\" Adrianna said as she hugged her daughter tightly. \"Troy is all right. It was Gabriella. Troy were the one who found her yesterday. She was brought to the hospital and Lucille don\\'t know if Troy got to see her or what he knows. It\\'s early there and he was finally sleeping,\" Adrianna consoled her daughter and wiped away her tears. \"Why her? She doesn\\'t deserve it,\" Makayla stated looking at her mother. I am going to be honest and say that I would be lying to all of you if I say I wasn\\'t nervous about the response I am getting on this chapter. I never wanted to upset anyone of you but I know this is a hard thing to talk about and not something people talk much about these days. Where I live in Norway there is currently an awareness campaign about overdoses and in a way, this is my contribution to spreading awareness. I hope you will still read my story and I feel bad for Gabriella but I don\\'t do OC deaths in my stories and I don\\'t plan on starting at the moment. Yes, I will reveal that this will have a happy ending but this story isn\\'t over anytime soon! Thank you so much to pumkinking5, LabyrinthDavidBowieWildcat30 and Lia for your reviews I love hearing your thoughts and comments. They are always greatly appreciated! Hopefully, you all will still want to continue reading so until next time! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 28] ['Oh my gosh you guys are amazing! So many more people started to follow/favourite the story after the last chapter and I am over the moon about the responses I got. Thank you everyone I couldn\\'t have done it without your support. Huge shout-out to pumkinking5 and Grace! I was so touched by reading your reviews and you really encouraged me to continue writing this chapter and inspired me to how it turned out. I am sorry that this took such a long time but I realised I made quite a large mistake about the dates in this story. The last time the date actually matched the plan I originally laid out were back in chapter 26 Pizza night . It took me some time to figure out where the fault was and then re-write so it fitted. Also the first weekend I planned on being productive in the weekend by getting ahead of my homework and writing fanfiction but end up with the flu so yeah, that wasn\\'t fun… Anyways let\\'s get on with the story! Wednesday 13 th of February. Troy\\'s POV As I blinked opening my eyes it was light outside so I assumed it had to be the next day. Sitting up on the couch the blanket that was draped over me fell down and I heard noises in the kitchen. Weird… I didn\\'t remember grabbing a blanket yesterday… I got up from the couch and walked towards the kitchen where my mom was making food. \"Mom?\" I questioned baffled as she smiled at me. \"Good morning,\" she smiled and wrapped me in a tight hug. \"When did you get here?\" I questioned as she turned to stir something on the stove. \"Just after two o\\'clock tonight. You were sound asleep and it looked like you needed it,\" she told her son and placed a bowl on the kitchen table. \"Come on, I made you breakfast so eat up,\" she told me taking her own cup of tea keeping me company. \"Thanks,\" I said as I grabbed the chopsticks starting to eat the Japanese breakfast bowl. \"I thought you had a meeting back home?\" I questioned looking up from my breakfast. \"Not that I\\'m not happy to see you,\" I hurried to say taking a bite out of the fish. \"I did but that could wait. Family is always more important and you needed me more,\" she told me taking a sip of her tea. \"Well I\\'m glad you\\'re here,\" I told her smiling. \"I spoke with Maria on the phone around midnight. She was flying in as soon as she could find a flight,\" mom told me putting her cup down. \"Where was she flying from? I never heard from Gabriella where she was,\" Troy told her mother who smiled softly. \"She were in Sacramento on a conference,\" she told me as I looked at the clock on the wall. 7 am. \"Could we head over to the hospital afterwards? She woke up yesterday but I had to leave since visiting hours were over,\" I explained to mom who had a smile on her face. \"That\\'s good to hear. I figured there were no point in sending you to school anyways,\" she said smiling a little. \"How was she?\" mom questioned and I sighed. \"Upset.\" I said immediately thinking back to how she reacted. \"Um… the doctors placed her on a suicide watch, afraid that she would try…,\" I said as my voice were shaking. \"Try to kill herself again,\" I said as my voice broke and I took a deep breath putting the chopsticks down. \"I\\'m not really that hungry anymore,\" I almost mumbled, my eyes glued on the half eaten bowl of food. \"All right. Why don\\'t you take a shower and change your clothes before we leave?\" mom questioned as she stood up and I nodded. \"Thank you,\" I told her as I hugged her and she wrapped her arms tightly around me. \"You\\'re welcome,\" she said and I walked upstairs. Walking downstairs barely ten minutes later I felt so much better. A change of clothes really helped and a thought crossed my mind, so I hurried to grab one of my hoodies before walking into the living room to find my mother. \"You ready?\" she questioned me and I nodded. \"Maria texted me earlier. She found a flight that left at six but it had a layover in Phoenix. It was supposed to land here just before eleven so she hoped she would be at the hospital around noon,\" mom told me and I nodded as we both goth into the car. As we arrived at the hospital mom had opted for staying in the waiting room reasoning that she should not be there before her own mother when she lived around the world, and I had to agree with her. Asking at the front desk what room she was in I learned that she had been moved to 603. I texted my mom about the change just in case as I headed towards the elevator. Walking down what seemed to be the same hallways as yesterday evening I found her room and I stopped. Nervously I lifted my arm to knock softly on the door before I entered. Her head immediately turned as the door opened and as our eyes met she had a smile on her face. \"You\\'re back?\" she stated more as a question and my heart broke. \"Of course,\" I said and closed the door behind me, moving forwards to sit beside the bed in one of the plastic chairs. \"How are you feeling?\" I questioned her and she fidgeted with her hands. It was then I noticed that the restrains had been removed. \"Better I guess. After you left yesterday they asked all sorts of questions and ran several different tests. I even spoke with a psychiatrist and I guess it somewhat helped but it made me realise on thing…\" she broke of and swallowed as tears gathered in her eyes. \"I\\'m scared I have disappointed both you and mom,\" she broke off and tears streamed down her cheeks. \"No sweetheart, you don\\'t disappoint me. I am relieved that you called me yesterday and I wish you could have told me sooner so I could have helped you. I should have seen the signs,\" I told her and she looked at me. \"No Troy,\" she begged me which caught my attention. \"Don\\'t blame yourself. It was on purpose that I didn\\'t tell anyone. You all had so much going on and I didn\\'t want to worry you about my troubles. I thought I could handle it,\" she told me and I took her hand. \"Brie always know that you can call me day or night. I want to be there for you when you need me,\" I told her sincerely and she looked down almost ashamed. \"I\\'m sorry Troy. I should have told you. You remember in mid to late January when I asked you to come over but you had a game? And also the first weekend in February when you were sick?\" she questioned and I nodded. \"I never told you, which I regret now, but mom left both times and I were alone. I know I should have said something but I felt bad. You had so much going on,\" she explained to me but I shook my head. \"No I never have too much to do so I don\\'t have time for you,\" I told her and she gave me a watery smile. She scooted towards one side of the bed and looked at me. \"I could really need a hug,\" she said and I smiled. \"Always,\" I said and sat down beside her wrapping my arms around her. She leaned onto my shoulder and I kissed the top of her head. \"I love you Brie,\" I told her softly and she snuggled closer towards me. \"I love you too Troy,\" she told me. \"Does mom know?\" she questioned like a small child in trouble. \"Yeah, she is trying to get a flight as soon as possible,\" I told her and she nodded and soon she was asleep. Still with one arm wrapped around her I somehow managed to get my phone out of my pocket and sent a text to Chad that neither me nor Gabriella would be at school today nor tomorrow. Maria\\'s POV I glanced at my watch once more as I entered the hospital building. Butterflies in my stomach and an ache in my heart. It was just after 11:30am and my plane had landed barely half an hour earlier. Yesterday I had been in a meeting that lasted much later than anyone intended and by the time I were back at the hotel it was close to midnight. I was going to call Gabriella to see how she was doing only to see that I had two missed calls. I called back the first one and it went thorough to the hospital and I got to speak with some doctor. As he told me what happened my heart sank. My baby girl had tried to kill herself? The second call also un-known happened to be to Lucille. I was surprised about how she got my number but I didn\\'t dwell on it at the moment. We spoke briefly and she shared that she was on her way over. I was surprised that she took the long flight around the world but Troy were closely involved in this incident. We hung up with promise to keep in touch as I found a flight and would eventually make my way back to Albuquerque. Yesterday I were packing my bags and gathering everything as quickly as I could. I went online and looked for the first flight available to either Santa Fe or Albuquerque. Unluckily it didn\\'t leave until six in the morning, but seeing as it would be quicker than driving I ordered a ticket… Next thing was to inform my boss and for once this was not negotiable. I had to leave. Walking past all of my colleagues who were mingling and chatting I found my boss. \"Hello Maria,\" she smiled and I tried to give her a half-hearted smile. \"May I speak with you for a brief moment alone?\" I questioned and she nodded. \"Certainly,\" she agreed and we found a quieter spot. \"I just received news that my daughter had tried to take her own life and were rushed to the hospital maybe an hour ago,\" I almost rambled and she looked at me with sympathy. \"Oh my,\" she uttered shocked. \"Please, we can do without you for the rest of the time. Take as long as you need Maria. Is there anything you need at the moment?\" she questioned me but I shook my head. \"I just booked a flight that leaves in a couple of hours but thank you,\" I told her and she nodded. \"I will be in touch later but don\\'t hesitate to reach out if there should be anything,\" she told me and I smiled gratefully. \"Thank you so much I will be in touch,\" I said and went back to my room to gather my belongings and headed towards the airport. After checking at the front desk what room she was in I walked down the hallway and knocked softly on the door. Opening it I smiled at the sight that meet me. Both of them were laying on the bed asleep as Troy had his arms wrapped tightly around her and she were resting her head on top of his chest. What really caught my attention was the hoodie she was wearing and the feeding tube going up her nose. The hoodie was way too big on her small frame and I suspected that it belonged to Troy. The more I looked at my daughter the more fragile she looked as if his hands were keeping her from disappearing like a leaf in the wind. Not wanting to disturb the two of them I sat down in the chair beside the bed and just watched them. It wasn\\'t more than half an hour later that someone entered the door and it was the doctor. \"Mrs Montez?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"Could we have a chat out in the hallway?\" he questioned me and I nodded following him. \"I am doctor Smith,\" he introduced himself as we shook hands. \"Maria Montez,\" I informed him and he nodded. \"So what we know at the moment is that her boyfriend called 911 last night at her house and told them he found her unconscious. Later it was revealed that she had taken a mix of sleeping pills and Advil, now were Gabriella in possession of either of these drugs?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"She have Advil and I have both of them in my medicine cabinet, but I can assure you it has never been an issue before,\" I told the doctor and he nodded a grim expression on his face. \"I see. Last night after she regained her consciousness we performed a series of tests where it came to our attention that she has depression and is malnourished. We offered her to talk to our psychologist which she agreed to. What we recommend based on that is to put her on a course of anti-depressants,\" the doctor explained to me and the thoughts were swirling in my head. \"When would that start?\" I questioned. \"As soon as you approved seeing as she is under the age of eighteen. If you want to speak to her about the matter before you make a decision is all right,\" he told me and I nodded. \"What can I do for her in the meantime and when she comes home?\" I questioned the doctor and I saw him smiling a little. \"I would suggest making plans of activities the two of you can do or encourage her to make plans with her friends. Make sure she knows that you are there for her through thick and thin,\" he advised me. \"My job requires me to travel a lot, what should I do about that?\" I questioned concerned not wanting this to happen again. Maybe I should do something else? \"I believe you should talk to her as soon as you find out and ask some of her friends or her boyfriend if she can stay there for the time being. If you\\'re away for a longer period, make plans with Gabriella before you leave, and make her have something to look forward to. If she already has plans with her friends then that\\'s great,\" he said. \"Thank you so much doctor,\" I said gratefully. \"No problem,\" he said and walked down the hallway. I stood outside the door for a couple of minutes and I noticed a woman who were walking who looked a lot like Troy. \"Hello,\" she smiled as she saw me. \"Maria?\" she questioned me and I nodded. \"Yes.\" \"I am Lucille. Troy\\'s mother,\" she introduced herself as we shook hands. \"Nice to meet you Lucille, I just wish it had under better circumstances,\" I told her and she gave me a soft smile. \"Indeed. How is she?\" Lucille questioned concerned. \"I believe she is doing better than last night. When I walked inside both of them were sleeping,\" I told Lucille and she smiled. \"Gabriella really made an impact on our family when she came during Christmas. I don\\'t think I have seen Troy as happy as when he is with her.\" \"Yeah they were talking together and she ran down the stairs asking me. To be honest I was a little relieved. The company asked me to attend a meeting and I tried my best to postpone it but ultimately I had to leave before Christmas,\" I told her with a sigh. \"I thought the holidays were supposed to be a public holiday?\" she questioned me. \"It is but vacation time is limited in many companies here in the US so by working those days it would have allowed me to be more with Gabriella during the summer, but of course the meeting got extended because of our business associate did not agree to our terms for the deal. When they talked about the deal I never imagined it would mean I had to travel away before Christmas eve,\" I tried to explain to her. \"I understand Maria,\" she told me softly. \"There have been more than once when Jack, his parents and me had to travel away during the holidays,\" she shared with me and I felt relieved that someone understood. \"Thank you. I guess I am just shocked that something like this could have happened,\" I confide in Lucille. \"I think we all were,\" she told me. Gabriella\\'s POV As I were waking up I was surrounded by warmth. It was comfortable. I blinked a couple of times opening my eyes and my head were resting on Troy\\'s chest and his left arm were loosely wrapped around me and the other were playing with my hair. \"Hello,\" he said as he noticed that I was awake. \"Did you sleep well?\" he questioned me and I nodded. \"I am warm and comfortable so yeah,\" I told him and he kissed the top of my head. \"What time is it?\" I questioned looking into his eyes. \"It\\'s just before noon. What about it?\" he questioned me frowning a little. \"I was just wondering if my mom were here,\" I told him sitting up. The blanket that had covered us fell down and Troy sat up as well. \"I am sure she is here now Brie. She probably had to speak with a doctor or something,\" he tried to convince me. Troy sighed and sat up, wrapping his right hand around me. \"How do you know?\" I questioned him, my voice choked up as tears were burning in the back of my eyes. He wrapped his arms around me and lifted me up before putting me down on the other side of the bed putting the blanket over my legs. \"Because she loves you,\" he told me wiping away some of the tears. \"She might not have done what was best at that moment but she still loves you Brie,\" he told me and I used the back of my hand to wipe away the last tears that rolled down my cheek. There was a small knock on the door and mom entered worry all over her face. \"Mom,\" I said and she rushed over to me. \"Oh hija,\" she exclaimed and wrapped me in a hug. \"I\\'ll be back later,\" Troy said and walked out of the room to let us talk. \"Mom would it be all right if I asked Chad and Taylor came after school? I don\\'t know how long I\\'ll be here but I should at least talk to them face to face,\" she told her mother. \"I think that would be smart but do you feel up for it?\" Maria questioned her daughter concerned. \"Yeah I have no idea what will happen tomorrow so I think it\\'s good to get it out of the way,\" Gabriella told her mother. \"All right maybe you could ask Troy to contact them once he come back,\" Maria suggested and Gabriella nodded. \"I thought about that. What is he doing now anyways?\" Gabriella questioned thoughtfully about what he could do here alone. \"Well I would guess he would be with his mother,\" Maria told her daughter who looked surprised. \"Lucille?\" she questioned. \"Is she here?\" \"Yes. I believe she made the decision to come after Troy called her. I meet her and we spoke but I thought Troy would have told you.\" \"Apparently he didn\\'t,\" Gabriella told her puzzled. Why didn\\'t he? There was a knock on the door and Troy entered with a smile. \"Am I interrupting?\" he questioned but Gabriella shook her head. \"Not at all, but you didn\\'t mention your mom being here,\" Gabriella said raising her eyebrow. \"Yeah I guess it wasn\\'t that important to mention,\" he told her nervously as Gabriella were smiling obviously amused. \"Is she here still?\" Gabriella questioned and Troy nodded. \"I want to say hello,\" Gabriella stated and Troy smiled. \"I\\'ll ask her to come,\" he said and walked out the door. He wasn\\'t out for long before he walked inside again with Lucille. \"Hello Gabriella,\" Lucille smiled as she walked inside the door. \"Lucille it\\'s good to see you again,\" Gabriella said opening her arms and Lucille moved forward to give her a hug. \"I am glad you are here,\" Lucille spoke quietly rubbing her back and as she spoke these words Gabriella wrapped her arms around Lucille\\'s neck and burst into tears. \"What\\'s wrong sweetheart?\" Maria questioned putting a hand on her daughter\\'s shoulder. \"I guess it just dawned on me that there are so many more than I thought of who love me for me,\" Gabriella claimed and Troy\\'s heart broke. \"Oh Brie,\" he muttered walking beside his mother and kissed the top of her head. \"We all do.\" A couple of hours later Troy\\'s phone made a sound and he looked at it. \"They are here,\" he announced and Gabriella nodded. \"I\\'ll be back,\" he announced and left the room. He met Taylor and Chad by the entrance and greeted them with a small smile. \"Hi,\" Taylor said as he came. \"Hey hoops,\" Chad greeted him. \"How are you?\" Taylor questioned having a weird feeling about the situation. \"I am good,\" he nodded looking at the two of his friends. \"What were you going to tell us and why are we at the hospital?\" Chad questioned confused. \"It is somewhat complicated,\" he told them and gestured for the to follow. \"Is Gabriella all right?\" Taylor questioned and Chad looked at her confused as they stepped into the empty elevator. \"She hanging in there now but last night something happened,\" he told them and lead them down the right hallway. \"Last night she called me,\" Troy started and stopped turning to look at his friends. \"Once I got to her house I found her unconscious and she had tried to kill herself,\" Troy told them and Taylor gasped. \"No,\" she muttered and Chad placed an arm around her shoulder. \"As in suicide?\" Chad questioned bewildered not believing what he was hearing. \"I\\'m afraid so. She wanted to see you today thought,\" Troy informed them and continued down to the right door. Troy opened it and saw Gabriella sitting there cross-legged in the bed laughing. Lucille and Maria were also laughing at whatever had been said. \"Hey,\" Gabriella said enthusiastically as she noticed her two friends standing in the doorway. Taylor immediately rushed over and engulfed her into a hug. \"We\\'ll let you be alone,\" Lucille said and the two older women left the room. \"Are they all in the same class?\" Lucille wondered once they closed the door and walked down the hallway. \"Yes, they have all formed a close bond in the short time. They are all involved in some of the same activities. I don\\'t know how much Troy has told you, but both of the boys are involved with basketball, Gabriella and Taylor are in the scholastic decathlon,\" Maria explained and Lucille smiled. \"Troy told me how he was introduced to basketball on the first day,\" Lucille smiled and Maria chuckled. \"I never asked Troy but why did he want to study here in America?\" Maria questioned looking at Lucille who had a sad smile playing on her lips. \"In Etrea everyone knew who he is and he never had any real friends besides a few he met because of who he is. Troy and I spoke about it and he told me he wanted people to see him as Troy and not Troy the prince. When he asked us if he could take a semester in America we said yes after some discussing and he ended up here in Albuquerque. He told us he wanted to be known as Troy and not Troy the prince, which was the reason for waiting so long to tell everyone about who he were. As we have spoken together it have become clear how much these couple of months have meant to him.\" Lucille told Maria as they headed towards the cafeteria to get something to drink. \"I love seeing how close they have become in such a short time. He really means a lot to Gabriella and they quite often spend time together working on projects and what not,\" Maria told Lucille and they both sat down by one of the tables. \"My sister and I spoke after Christmas and she told me how much her daughter loved spending time with Gabriella. We all appreciated that she could despite the late invitation,\" Lucille spoke before taking a sip of her tea. \"Yeah, I was relieved when she asked me so she wouldn\\'t be alone,\" Maria said folding her hands around the warm styrofoam cup. \"What about your husband?\" Lucille questioned putting the cup down. \"He passed away while Gabriella was young. She remembers him and loved spending Christmas together as a family,\" Maria said wiping away a single tear. \"I am so sorry. I did not mean to,\" Lucille told sincerely feeling bad. \"No it\\'s ok you had no way of knowing,\" Maria defended. \"But I\\'m sure he would approve of Troy. Especially after this,\" Maria said with a little smile. \"I really hope things work out. Alex and Amelia, Troy\\'s grandparents, loved her me and Jack included,\" Lucille told Maria who smiled. \"Please know that you both are welcomed at any time,\" she continued and Maria smiled. \"Thank you. That means a lot and I am certain Gabriella will take you up on that offer,\" Maria told Lucille who laughed. Hope you all liked this chapter. This chapter has not been fully proof read, since I finished writing this literary just now, so I guarantee you there are mistakes here. Can\\'t wait to hear what you all thought so until next time! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 29] ['Hello everyone! Thank you so much for being so patient with me. School has kept me quite busy with several analyses of text, from Norse mythology, in a relatively short time frame. Plus, now I have until Thursday to read myself up on the conflict in Yemen and how France would handle the situation because our class is participating in a fake UN security council meeting. So exciting but quite a bit to grasp! Shout-out to pumkinking5 and Grace for your encouraging reviews. So touching that you\\'re sharing your own personal experience and I feel like this chapter focuses more on the people around the loved one who are struggling. Your reviews are as always greatly appreciated! Sorry in advance for any mistake since this has in no way been proof read, he he. \" I really hope things work out. Alex and Amelia, Troy\\'s grandparents, lov ed her me and Jack included,\" Lucille told Maria who smiled. \"Please know that you both are welcomed at any time,\" she continued and Maria smiled. \" Thank you. That means a lot and I am certain Gabriella will take you up on that offer,\" Maria told Lucille who laughed. \"So what plans does Gabriella have for next year?\" Lucille questioned as they were sitting in the cafeteria talking. \"She have applied to several colleges across America. Unfortunately, I think there are only a handful of them she really wants to attend. I believe she applied to many of them because of the uncertainty about where my job will transfer me. We only moved to Albuquerque about a year ago and I made the company promise me that we wouldn\\'t move until she graduate,\" Maria told Lucille. \"I imagine it\\'s hard to stay in touch with her friends,\" Lucille mentioned and Maria nodded. \"She tried before we moved here but she told me she never went there long enough to get any real friends. I have never seen her as happy as she is with Troy. I believe that is part of why she choose to apply to a college in Etrea,\" Maria told a surprised Lucille. \"Really?\" she questioned raisin her eyebrows. \"You know the name of the college?\" Lucille questioned and Maria thought. \"She did mention it…\" Maria said thinking for a minute. \"Something about College of Etrea,\" Maria told and Lucille had a smile on her face. \"Royal college of Etrea,\" she stated and Maria nodded. \"That\\'s it.\" \"Troy also applied there or rather accepted at once. What everyone is waiting on is to see what he chooses to major in,\" Lucille explained. \"Do you know what Gabriella wants to study?\" she questioned. \"She have been talking about law but that was here in America. I don\\'t think she mentioned what she wanted to study in Etrea but I have a feeling it might be law,\" Maria told Lucille thoughtfully. \"That is exciting. Do you think she will move to Etrea if she is going to study law?\" Lucille questioned and Maria nodded. \"I have a feeling she will. I don\\'t see it likely that they offer American law,\" Maria reasoned before continuing, \"Of course I hope she enjoy herself if she ends up getting accepted but it will be thought in the start knowing she is so far away,\" Maria explained her eyes getting teary. \"Oh they always go their own ways whether we like to or not. To be honest I was missing Troy terribly for the first couple of weeks but it got better over time and I knew that he would come back home for Christmas,\" Lucille shared with Maria. \"Hopefully she would want to come back home for Christmas,\" Maria told Lucille whom nodded. \"Nothing is more important than family during the holidays,\" Lucille agreed. \"So I have to ask. How did you and Jack meet. I mean it must have been quite a shock,\" Maria mentioned and Lucille laughed quietly. \"Oh I never anticipated it. Jack went to Royal College of Etrea while I went to a different school close by in Saint Germains. We could not have studied more different subjects either. He had chosen international politics and I were studying psychology,\" Lucille laughed remembering back to her college years. \"We were first introduced at a mutual friend\\'s party but we barely spoke, I mean he were a part of the royal family why would he talk to me were the thought\\'s running through my head. But we spoke on some occasions but we never really got in touch again until after college and then we hit it off,\" Lucille told Maria lifting the styrofoam cup up to her lips. \"It took some time before we got engaged because he served a year in the military but we got engaged in August 1988 and got married in March 1989. Then a year later in March 1990 Troy was born,\" Lucille shared with Maria who seemed surprised. \"Did Jack choose to sign up for the military?\" Maria wondered but Lucille shook her head. \"No he did not,\" Lucille sighed. \"Despite Etrea being a large country with 129 million habitants we do have conscription for the military where everyone has to fill out what you could call an application. Then they choose based on these applications, and they are asked to perform some tests before the final answer comes. Somehow there is still a large representation of men, heaven knows why,\" Lucille shared shaking her head. \"We have been trying several times to even out the gender inequality but it does not seem to work… It is still a work in progress.\" Thursday 14 th of February Troy\\'s POV \"Mom?\" I questioned walking into the kitchen. \"Could we stop somewhere before we head to the hospital?\" I asked her and she nodded. \"What did you have in mind?\" she questioned him taking a sip of her tea. \"Since it\\'s valentine\\'s day, I wanted to do something special for Gabriella. I thought about getting her some flowers,\" I explained to mom who smiled. \"That\\'s a good idea,\" she encouraged me. \"Your breakfast is on the counter and then we can leave,\" mom told me leaving no room for discussions. \"Thanks,\" I said and went into the kitchen to retrieve my food. About half an hour later mom and I walked through the hallways at the hospital. I ended up with buying her a bouquet of red roses and a small stuffed teddy bear who held a heart saying I love you. I knocked on the door before we both walked inside. \"Good morning and happy valentine\\'s day,\" I told Gabriella who blushed but had a smile on her face. \"Happy valentine\\'s day Troy,\" she told me as I handed her the teddy and roses. \"These are beautiful Troy,\" she claimed and smelled the flowers. \"And they smell so good. Thank you,\" she told me and kissed my cheek. \"How are you feeling Gabriella?\" mom asked gently and took a seat beside Maria. \"I am better,\" she started telling us but I knew she was hesitating about something. \"but,\" she continued not meeting my gaze, \"they want to keep me here at least a couple of days to look further into the malnourishment as a result of the tube,\" she admitted and hugged the teddy bear close to her. \"I am sorry to hear that Gabriella. Hopefully, you\\'ll be home soon enough,\" Lucille told her and Gabriella smiled a little. \"I really hope so too,\" Gabriella admitted. \"How are you really feeling?\" I questioned her as both of our mother\\'s had left us to be alone for a moment. \"Tired, guilty, ashamed,\" she started listing up to me and I gripped her hand. \"Sweetheart,\" I told her wrapping my other hand around her shoulder. \"You shouldn\\'t feel like that. You have no reason to. This was not your fault,\" I told her scooting closer. \"But it was,\" she protested. \"I choose…\" she said swallowing tears. \"I choose to try it ,\" she protested. \"But would you if they hadn\\'t encouraged and manipulated you?\" I questioned her and she sniffled. \"I guess not,\" she admitted slowly looking at me. \"You choose to call me Brie. You wanted to be here today and that\\'s what matters. Know that whenever you\\'re in doubt you can always talk to me, no matter the time,\" I assure her and a small smile formed on her lips. \"Thank you Troy. I don\\'t know what I would have done without you,\" she told me and moved closer towards me. \"I love you Brie, don\\'t ever doubt that,\" I told her kissing her forehead. \"I think that you should return to school tomorrow Troy,\" mom told me as we were all in the room before I and mom left for the day. \"I think you should Troy I\\'ll be fine for a couple of hours. Mom will be here anyways,\" Gabriella told me and I knew I couldn\\'t argue about this. \"Fine,\" I agreed but I looked back at mom then Gabriella, \"but I\\'ll be here after school,\" I told them and mom smiled a little. \"I expected nothing else,\" she told me looking at her clock. \"I guess we need to call it a day,\" mom shared with us and rose from the chair. \"Yeah,\" I agreed a little reluctantly. \"I\\'ll see you tomorrow,\" I told Brie as she moved over to hug me tightly. \"Bye,\" she told me not letting go. \"I love you and thank you,\" she whispered quietly and I smiled. \"No worries and love you too,\" I told her and she released me. \"Are you okay?\" mom questioned me as we were driving home. \"I guess I\\'m okay,\" I told her looking at the scenery that passed us. \"I mean when Kelsi first called me asking if I had spoken to her I never imagined something like this having happened…\" I trailed off looking ahead. \"So many thoughts were running through my head as she rang me. I feared the worst when she hung up on the phone,\" I shared with mom. \"You shouldn\\'t focus on what happened but rather that you found her when you did. She is ok because of you,\" mom reasoned with me and I somewhat had to agree. \"I guess that\\'s true…\" \"You could have, for whatever reason, chosen not to answer when she called you that night. You could have chosen not to go over to her house. There are so many choices you made at your own free will that saved her. She is here because of you Troy,\" mom told me and I quickly wiped away a tear that lingered in my eye. \"You are right,\" I agreed as mom parked the car by the house. Walking inside mom turned on the light putting the keys down. \"Are you hungry?\" she questioned me as I took off my jacket. \"Not really. I\\'ll just be heading to bed,\" I told her and she smiled softly. \"All right. Goodnight,\" mom told me engulfing me in a hug. \"Night mom,\" I told her feeling a little better. Somehow mom always knew how to make things better, and to be honest I was glad she came here. I flopped down on my bed and after what must have been a couple of hours I fell into a restless sleep. The sound of my alarm was just about the only sound going through the house the next morning. I rolled over and turned it off as I contemplated just staying in bed today. I really didn\\'t want to get up. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes before dragging myself out of bed and into the shower. Not long after I had finished showering, dressing and brushed through my hair. Walking into the kitchen I took a quick look in the fridge before deciding that I had to shop for groceries very soon. I picked up an apple from the bowl of fruit before making my way to school. I sat down at my desk just as the warning bell was sounded and Chad looked at me. \"Hey hoops, good to see you today,\" Chad told me enthusiastically. \"Hey,\" I told him and even Taylor looked at me. \"I didn\\'t want to be here, but both mom and Gabriella thought I shouldn\\'t skip school anymore,\" I shared with her and she nodded. \"How is she doing?\" Taylor questioned. \"As good as can be expected. I promised I\\'d be there after school today,\" I shared with them. \"Mrs Montez must have told the principal already because Darbus told the class yesterday and by now they must understand it\\'s about Gabriella since you\\'re back,\" Chad informed me. \"I should have guessed that. What happened to those involved?\" I questioned them and Chad shrugged his shoulders. \"Rumours has it that Brittney was expelled and Alexandra was suspended for a couple of days and suspended from after-school activities,\" Taylor shared and I were a little surprised. Despite what they did were awful I didn\\'t fully anticipate this outcome… \"Also Darbus spoke to me after class and told me that she hoped Gabriella would return and if there should be any issues she could come to her at once,\" Taylor told me. \"I\\'ll tell her. Hopefully, that information would help her when she returns,\" I told Taylor as the bell sounded and our teacher entered the classroom. The day dragged on and soon enough I found myself seated at a lunch table with the Wildcat gang answering all sorts of questions about how Gabriella was. Soon enough our group split up with Taylor heading towards the library already having passed history, Kelsi and Ryan heading towards the auditorium for a rehearsal with Darbus and the rest of us ended up in our different history classes. I and Chad were only half paying attention but I looked up when I heard the teacher call my name. \"Mr Bolton, can you tell me what happened to Wall Street in 1929?\" Mrs Howie questioned looking at me. \"No I\\'m sorry,\" I apologized and she nodded looking at Chad. \"What about you Mr Danforth?\" she questioned. \"No Mrs Howe,\" Chad told her having been caught completely off guard. \"I\\'m giving you both a warning,\" she told us continuing her lesson. \"Mr Bolton, can you tell us something that contributed to the Great Depression?\" Mrs Howe asked as she had obviously understood that we were still not paying attention. \"No,\" I muttered looking up. \"Mr Danforth?\" she asked. \"No Mrs Howe,\" Chad told her. \"Please speak to me after class,\" she told us before continuing the lesson. When the bell rang the class packed up and left. Me and Chad walked up to Mrs Howe who looked at us. \"Boys you need to pay more attention in my class. Especially you Mr Bolton who didn\\'t attend class yesterday.\" \"I had a valid reason,\" I argued looking at her. \"I know that and I\\'m sorry about what happened, but you are here today. Therefor I am going to have to give you both a two-day detention after school. No arguments,\" she said giving us a look writing the slips. She handed it to us before we walked out the door towards homeroom \"Didn\\'t you promise Gabriella you would head over after class?\" Chad asked as we hurried down the hallway. \"Yes,\" I told him solemnly. \"And she knows when we\\'re finished. I have no idea how to tell her,\" I told Chad as we entered the room and sat down in our regular seats \"Don\\'t you two look like sunshine,\" Taylor commented as she saw us. \"Not funny,\" Chad muttered looking at her. \"What happened?\" \"Both of us got detention and I promised Gabi I would be at the hospital after school,\" I explained to her and she made a face. \"I need to do something for the declaration team after school, but it shouldn\\'t take long, and then I can head over and be with Gabi until you make it there. I\\'ll explain what happened,\" Taylor suggested. \"You would? Thank you so much Taylor,\" I told her gratefully as the bell rang and Darbus entered in her own theatrically way. \"Ok class,\" Darbus said starting her rant about drama that no-one really listened to. XOXO After a long one and a half hour later the bell sounded dismissing us for the day. \"Remember to read the text for homework,\" Darbus reminded the class as they hurried out of the room. Well almost everyone. Except for me and Chad that was. We stopped by our lockers to collect homework for the weekend, hoping to get something done in detention before we headed back towards our homeroom where detention was being held. There Mrs Darbus sat at her chair on the stage reading some form of poetry. She looked up when she heard us and seemed surprised to see the two of us. \"I\\'m surprised to see the two of you here. I would imagine you, Mr Bolton, to be with Miss Montez at the moment,\" she said with a little smile. \"Trust me I would Ms D but we\\'re here for detention,\" I informed her. \"Really?\" she questioned slightly shocked. \"Mrs Howe gave us detention during history,\" Chad explained and we gave her the slips. \"I was told there was two for detention and I was wondering who on earth managed to get it on a Friday afternoon, but I\\'m not too surprised with the two of you,\" she chuckled and we had to smile. \"I was thinking about telling them about drama and as you know proximity to the arts is cleansing for the soul, but I will spare you both. I could imagine you both have a lot going on so on this rare occasion I will let you both do homework,\" she informed us and we were somewhat in shock. Darbus never allowed to do homework in class. \"Unfortunately I cannot let you off early but you both deserve it,\" she shared with us, a certain sadness in her voice coming through. \"It means a lot,\" I told her as we sat down starting some of the work. Hope you all like it and I will try my best to not delay the next chapter as much. Reviews are always greatly appreciated! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 30] ['Thank you so much for all your support!

Friday, February 15 th Gabriella were looking at the clock once again as the time passed. Troy had finished school by now and somehow she knew that he should have been here by now. Maria caught her daughters look and Gabriella offered her a small smile. \"Looking for something?\" she questioned and Gabriella sighed. \"He should have been here by now. He promised.\" \"I am sure he just got caught up at school. Don\\'t worry sweetheart,\" Maria tried to ease her daughter\\'s worries. \"But we finished over half an hour ago. He should have been here by now, even if he went home first,\" she argued looking from the clock towards her mother. \"Maybe he won\\'t come at all,\" Gabriella told her mother darkly. Maria moved towards her daughter and sat down on the bed beside her, cupping her chin. \"Hija,\" Maria started wiping away a tear that ran down her cheek. \"That boy adores you, and do not doubt that, even for a second. He would do everything he can to spend as much time with you as possible. Remember yesterday?\" Maria questioned and Gabriella nodded slightly. \"He didn\\'t want to leave your side all day. The only reason he left at night were because he wasn\\'t allowed, because he isn\\'t close family. I heard that Lucille almost had to force him to school today, he would much rather spend it with you,\" Marie told her daughter kissing her head. In that moment there were a knock on the door before it opened and Taylor walked inside. \"Hey is this a bad time?\" she questioned standing in the doorway. \"No,\" Gabriella said shaking her head. \"Please come in,\" Maria invited and Taylor smiled closing the door behind her. \"Was Troy at school today?\" Gabriella questioned her friend at once. \"Yes and that is the reason why I am here,\" Taylor explained taking a seat in the chair. \"Troy and Chad had history together before the last period and Mrs Howie gave them both detention after school. I had to finish up with the Scholastic Decathlon club but I came as soon as I could,\" Taylor shared with her. \"How did he manage to get detention?\" Gabriella questioned frowning. \"Well something about the two of them not paying attention in class,\" Taylor explained and Maria smiled looking at her daughter. \"He said he would be here as soon as he could,\" Taylor hurried to add and Gabriella\\'s shoulders sagged in relief. Back at East High Darbus had been sitting on her throne having been reading the whole time. Troy and Chad had both finished up their work and were beyond bored. Chad were seated beside Troy and the two of them had come up with a game. Each were to make a list of as many names they could in alphabetical order starting with A. Whenever either of them could not think of a name they were to write the next letter in the alphabet and so it continued. By now the two of them were all the way down to Z and it was Chad\\'s turn. He scribbled something onto the paper and passed it to Troy. Unfolding it he saw the single work pass! scribbled onto with bold letters. Troy laughed and curled the paper together as Darbus looked at the two of them raising an eye. He took the crumbled piece of paper and threw it at his friend hitting him in the head. The ball bounced off his hair and landed on the floor close by. \"Idiot,\" Chad muttered lifting his head to look at his friend. Darbus had no other choice than to laugh quietly looking at the two of them. She glanced at the clock that were situated in the back of the classroom before she closed her book softly. \"Well I have to leave now but I assume you both are staying?\" she asked with a little wink at them. \"Have a good week-end,\" she wished the two of them and closed the door behind her. \"Can we leave?\" Chad whispered confused and Troy gave him a look. \"Ohh…\" he suddenly realised making a face. The two boys picked up their backpacks and walked out of the classroom and towards the hospital. Chad had driven the two of them to the hospital stating that he wanted to say hi to Gabriella too, but Troy suspected that it might be to see Taylor too. The two of them made their way towards her room and entered after knocking. The sight that meet them were both Taylor and Gabriella sitting on the bed with books and papers scattered everywhere. Gabriella looked up once she heard someone enter and she broke out into a big smile seeing her boyfriend. \"Hey you\\'re early,\" she commented closing the book. \"Darbus let us out early. There were only me and Chad there,\" Troy told him and Taylor frowned cocking her head. \"Are we talking about the same Mrs. Darbus?\" she questioned and we all started laughing. \"Well I\\'m glad you\\'re here now. How was school?\" she questioned but Troy heard the slight fear in her voice. \"School is school,\" he shrugged taking a seat beside her bed. Gabriella nodded before looking at Taylor whom were starting to gather the scattered papers. \"We should just call it a day. You\\'ve really helped me,\" Taylor told Gabriella looking at her. \"It was nothing. I enjoy doing this Taylor really,\" Gabriella told her helping to gather everything. \"Scholastic decathlon team?\" Chad questioned looking at the content on the bed. \"Yes, we have a competition soon which I really hope I could participate in but for the time being the least I could do is to help Taylor,\" Gabriella explained and Taylor stopped abruptly looking at her. \"Gabi don\\'t worry about it. If you\\'re there that would be awesome but just focus on getting better and we\\'ll take it from there,\" Taylor assured her and Gabriella nodded. \"Alright.\" \"How are you Gabster?\" Chad questioned earning a genuine smile from Gabriella. \"I am better defiantly but I am not a hundred percent yet but I am getting there,\" she told them confidently. \"And all of you guys have defiantly help me so thank you,\" she told them honestly which earned a smile from everyone in the room. \"I hope you know that you can give anyone of us a call if there should be anything,\" Chad told her and Troy nodded agreeing earning a smile from both of the girls. \"Oh I defiantly know,\" Gabriella answered looking at Troy. \"Especially love boy over there,\" Taylor whispered to Gabriella but not quietly enough for the two boys not to hear. \"I heard that Taylor,\" Troy told her laughing. \"What?\" she asked faking clueless earning a laugh from her best friend. \"Come on Chad,\" Taylor told her boyfriend taking his hand. \"Let\\'s leave the lovebirds alone,\" she continued almost dragging him behind her. \"Thanks Taylor I\\'ll remember that,\" Gabriella laughed. \"Bye see you soon,\" she called out as they left us laughing. \"I am sorry I couldn\\'t be her earlier,\" Troy apologized taking her hand. \"No it\\'s okay. I won\\'t lie and say I wasn\\'t worried but I understand now,\" Gabriella said and leaned forwards kissing him softly. She smiled once she felt the spark in their kiss and she felt Troy smile too. \"I love you Troy. So much it hurts,\" Gabriella said gazing deep into his eyes. \"I love you too Gabriella. Don\\'t ever doubt it,\" he told her and kissed her softly once more. \"I\\'m tired of being here,\" she said with a sigh changing the theme of their conversation. \"I could understand that. On that note, I spoke to the principal today and he was wondering when you were returning to school and that when you did just to talk to one of the teachers or him if there should be anything. Also, I cleaned out your locker for the notes.\" \"Thank you, it means a lot. I want to go back to school but I don\\'t want history to be repeated,\" she confessed and he looked at her somatically. \"It won\\'t,\" he assured her. \"Brittney was expelled, Alexandra was suspended with detention and Chad, Taylor and I gave the notes to the principal today so he was going to look into that,\" Troy shared and she visibly relaxed. \"Besides when you return I won\\'t leave your side and all of the other Wildcats will be there,\" he confessed and to his surprise, Gabriella smiled patting the spot on the bed beside her. \"You\\'re the best,\" Gabriella told him as he sat down, cuddling into him. Troy wrapped his hands around her and kissed her forehead. \"I\\'ll always be there for you, whatever happens, no matter the distance,\" he told her almost in a whisper. \"Tomorrow,\" Gabriella started looking at him, gaining his attention. \"Tomorrow I\\'m going to talk to the doctors all day and I think you should spend some time with your mom,\" Gabriella confessed. \"If you\\'re sure,\" he told her a little hesitantly. \"Be with your mom, play basket with the others and have some fun. It\\'s going to be boring for you here at the hospital because I doubt you\\'ll be allowed to be here. I\\'ll call you if I need you okay?\" she questioned and he agreed. \"Don\\'t be scared to call ok? I would be here in a heartbeat,\" he told her. \"I know,\" she smiled. Troy arrived home a little after seven that evening and entering the house his mother was in the kitchen making dinner. \"Hello, how was school?\" she questioned walking out greeting her son. \"Okay,\" he told her putting his backpack on the chair by the table, kicking off his shoes. \"Me and Chad ended up in detention though,\" he told her with a sigh taking off his jacket. There was no point in lying seeing as she would know in the end. \"Really? How did that happen?\" she questioned knowing that Troy usually did not get himself into trouble. \"It was in history and neither one of us paid attention so when our teacher asked a question neither of us could answer. Twice,\" he confessed and surprisingly enough Lucille was smiling. \"Taylor went over to the hospital to tell Gabriella after school,\" Troy continued following his mother into the kitchen. \"That was nice of her,\" Lucille said retrieving the food, putting it on the table. \"Yeah, the two of them have been friends since Gabriella moved here last year,\" he shared sitting down with his mom to eat dinner. On Saturday Troy showed his mother around in Albuquerque before he met up with Jason, Zeke and Chad to play some basketball. Well, as much as he could with his hand still in a cast being well aware that he shouldn\\'t play at all… In the evening he received a text from his girlfriend stating that she was having meetings at the hospital tomorrow as well not knowing the surprise he was in for on Monday morning. \"So Gabriella Dr Juanez is ready for you now,\" the nurse told her and Gabriella nodded. \"Thanks,\" she told her and together with her mother she walked towards the psychologist\\'s office. \"Are you hopeful about going home?\" Maria questioned her daughter who nodded excitedly. \"Yes. I am ready for it only to be the two of us,\" Gabriella told her as they walked down the hallway. \"Do you really think Troy would leave you alone?\" Maria asked and Gabriella blushed. \"No,\" she muttered smiling. \"No need to be shy hija. That boy adores you, and he will do anything for you. I know your father would very much approve of him, and so do I,\" Maria told her daughter. \"Thank you, mom. It means a lot to me,\" she told her almost excitedly and they stopped outside her office. \"Do you want me to go with you?\" Maria asked looking at Gabriella as she thought for a split second. \"Is it all right if I go by myself?\" she questioned and Maria nodded. \"Of course hija. I will be right outside if there should be anything,\" Maria told her watching as her daughter knocked on the door before entering. She gave her one last encouraging smile before she sat down in one of the leather couches there. \"Hello Gabriella,\" Dr Juanez greeted her in her thick Spanish accent. \"It\\'s good to see you again,\" she greeted and got up to shake her hand. \"Hello Estelinda,\" Gabriella said taking a seat in the large chair there. \"I see you\\'re here alone,\" she commented and Gabriella nodded. \"Yeah,\" she breathed out having a quick moment of doubt about her decision. \"Mom is sitting just outside waiting,\" she told her and Gabriella seemed to gain a little confidence by saying that sentence. \"So mom still won\\'t know anything about what we\\'re talking about?\" Gabriella questioned making sure. \"Not if you don\\'t want to,\" Estelinda assured her. \"This could stay between the two of us.\" Gabriella took a deep breath looking at her therapist, meeting her look. \"There is one thing I am worried about,\" Gabriella started. \"Please share,\" Estelinda encouraged her. \"After I\\'ve been discharged. I want to return to school but what if something pushed me over the edge. What if I actually go so far as killing myself?\" Gabriella asked her voice thick with emotions. \"It sounds as you don\\'t want that to happen. That you want to live,\" Estelinda said and Gabriella nodded agreeing. \"When you say you want to live I believe you, Gabriella. You seem so much better than when we first spoke. Why do you think that is?\" she asked wanting Gabriella to say it herself. \"I can thank my boyfriend, my friends and of course mom. They have really been there for me for the past week. I love all of them,\" Gabriella told Estelinda smiling from ear to ear. Estelinda didn\\'t say anything and watched Gabriella as she suddenly realised something. \"Oh my gosh,\" she suddenly realised. \"Mhm. I would say you have improved enormously. Earlier you didn\\'t think that people loved you because…\" \"because I stated so myself, but now I know that they really do because they have been there for me,\" Gabriella finished. \"Exactly and that means you have improved. I won\\'t lie to you, Gabriella. You will have days that are harder than others where the world seems to be against you. Therefore, I want you to write down things that make you happy,\" she said handing her a paper and pen. \"Why?\" Gabriella questioned. \"You\\'ll see. Write a list about what makes you the happiest at the top and continue,\" she said and watched as Gabriella took the pen and started writing. Gabriella did as her psychologists said and put down the pen down when she was done. \"I don\\'t need to read it, Gabriella. No-one besides you have to unless you want to,\" Estelinda clarified to her. \"Now whenever feel down and things go against you I want you to look at that list and do one or several things on there to make you feel better. Experience shows that most suicide victims have a hard time on the date of their suicides, but being around loved once always help,\" Estelinda confessed. \"Thank you Estelinda,\" Gabriella told the woman smiling. \"You\\'re welcome dear,\" she told her having a smile of her own. \"Is there anything else you want to talk about?\" she asked and Gabriella thought for a moment. \"No, I don\\'t think so.\" \"Ok, that was it for this time then. I would say you are ok to be discharged and sent home but I want you to remember that you can call me and set up an appointment at any time. Also, the school nurse is great to talk to if it is urgent. Remember you are not alone Gabriella,\" Estelinda said. \"Thank you for everything,\" Gabriella said standing up. \"No problem. You are a beautiful young woman with a bright future ahead of you. Go out and enjoy yourself,\" Estelinda advised. \"I will,\" Gabriella agreed with a smile hugging her. \"This is not a goodbye, it\\'s I\\'ll see you later, but hopefully during other circumstances,\" Gabriella told her wisely. \"I couldn\\'t agree more,\" Estelinda smiled proudly. Gabriella walked out of her office, the list in hand, and saw her mother sitting there waiting. \"How did it go?\" she asked putting the magazine down walking towards her daughter. \"Great. We talked and she gave me some advice on how to tackle hard days and reminded me that I could just call her or talk to the school nurse,\" Gabriella summed up. \"That\\'s great hija. Did she tell you anything about when you could go?\" Maria questioned hopefully. \"As soon as the doctors would allow so I am hoping for today. I miss my bed,\" she stated and Maria laughed hugging her daughter. \"Oh sweetheart.\" That was it! Hope you all liked it and things are finally looking good for Gabriella! Comments are always appreciated. -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 31] ['A little late Happy Thanksgiving to all my American readers! I am sorry this chapter is delayed, but I had my half term mock exams, and a really bad cold for the past week. Today, finally, I am feeling good enough to edit and publish this chapter. Huge shoutout to Grace and Pumkingking5 for your reviews in the last chapter you guys are amazing! Hope this answers some of your questions regarding Troy\\'s family, especially the incident with Calvin. Now my next couple of chapters are planned and they should be quite fun so without further ado! \" Great. We talked and she gave me some advice on how to tackle hard days and reminded me that I could just call her or talk to the school nurse,\" Gabriella summed up. \"That\\'s great hija. Did she tell you anything about when you could go?\" Maria questioned hopefully. \" As soon as the doctors would allow so I am hoping for today. I miss my bed,\" she stated and Maria laughed hugging her daughter. \"Oh sweetheart.\" Monday February 18 th \"Are you sure you want to go back full time?\" Maria questioned her daughter as they were eating breakfast together early in the morning. \"I am,\" Gabriella nodded. \"I have been away for a couple of days already and I don\\'t want to be too far behind on my work,\" she assured her mother. \"All right. I should be home by four and call me today if there should be anything,\" Maria reminded her daughter. \"I\\'ll remember mom but I have to run. I am meeting up with Taylor soon,\" Gabriella told her mom as she gave her a quick hug before picking up her bag and rushed out the door. \"Bye,\" she called out as the door closed and Maria were left with a smile on her face. She would be all right in the end. \"Are you ready?\" Taylor questioned as the two girls were nearing the school. \"Yes, I mean I am a little nervous but I am ready to go back. Troy told me what happened to Brittney and Alexandra and I guess that helped me in making my decision about coming today,\" Gabriella explained and Taylor nodded. \"I have a feeling Troy is going to be surprised. I told Chad once you called me but he swore he wouldn\\'t tell. Once Troy realises you\\'re here, he will not leave your side,\" Taylor stated and Gabriella laughed. \"I know, and I love that,\" she told her friend whom also started laughing at this point. \"Gabi,\" Chad exclaimed once he saw them and rushed forwards hugging Gabriella, lifting her up from the floor. \"Chad,\" she yelped in surprise and laughed. \"Put me down,\" she said through her laughed and Chad obligated. \"How are you?\" he questioned her and she still had her smile on her face. \"Good really. Ready to go back to normal,\" she told him and now it was Chad\\'s time to grin. \"Speaking off,\" he told her and it was then she noticed Troy. \"Why didn\\'t you tell me?\" he questioned not really sounding upset. \"Um surprise?\" she tried and he wrapped his arms around her. \"Thank you,\" he told her quietly, hugging her. \"Wait,\" Gabriella told him grabbing his left arm not feeling his cast. \"Your cast. When did you remove it? I knew you had it on Friday,\" she exclaimed and Taylor frowned too. \"Yes. I got it removed on Sunday and the doctor told me everything seemed to be as it should. After all I have had it on for nine weeks,\" he told her wrapping his fingers around her hand. \"Do you know when you can start playing basketball again?\" she questioned him and he nodded. \"Hopefully within four weeks but worst case would be eight or more,\" he shared. \"Which means that we have a shoot at the final becoming back to back champions,\" Chad told them all excited and they couldn\\'t do anything else than laugh at his childlike excitement. \"Come on Chad we should get to class,\" Taylor told him grabbing him by the arm dragging him after her. \"Oh dear,\" Gabriella muttered smiling following her boyfriend through the hallways. Walking through the door of their homeroom they were the first once there except for Mrs. Darbus. She looked up at the teens who entered the room and smiled once she saw Gabriella. \"Hello Miss Montez. It\\'s good to see you here again. I hope you are doing better?\" she questioned the young woman. \"Hello Mrs. Darbus and yes I am doing much better thank you,\" Gabriella told the teacher with a smile. \"I look forwards seeing you in class and drama rehearsals. I am afraid it hasn\\'t been quite the same without you,\" Darbus revealed looking at the two of them. \"I plan on returning and I am very much looking forwards to it,\" Gabriella shared with her drama teacher who smiled. \"Welcome back,\" Darbus told the group with a smile as Gabriella walked over to her seat. The day had gone well for Gabriella when lunch rolled around. Both of her classes she had with Troy and he were by her side once the bell rung. \"Do you want to sit in the cafeteria or on the roof?\" Troy questioned as they were walking out of Spanish together. \"Could we sit with the others. I haven\\'t seen all of them for quite some time.\" Gabriella told Troy and followed her towards the cafeteria. Upon entering the large room, it was not overly crowded by students but it was defiantly starting to fill up. Neither of them having brought their lunch with them, they grabbed a tray and walked up to the line that had been formed. Each of them grabbed their food and sat down at the table where they found Taylor along with Chad, Zeke and Kelsi. \"Hi,\" Gabriella said announcing their presence. \"Hey Gabi. Good to see you again and finally someone who can help me,\" she exclaimed gathering some of the papers who covered the seats at the table. \"What is it?\" Gabriella questioned sliding down in the seat. \"I am trying to write some songs for our musical but I could need your help. Could you meet me in the music room after school? It shouldn\\'t take long,\" Kelsi begged her friend. \"Sure. I am looking forward to seeing what you have written,\" Gabriella told the young composer who smiled. The group continued on with their discussions about school, activities and life in general. Gabriella were staring at her bowl of soup eating some spoonful\\'s slowly. \"You okay?\" Troy questioned his girlfriend quietly looking at her. \"Mhm, just not too hungry,\" she answered sheepishly. \"I can tell you more once we\\'re alone,\" she told him and he agreed taking another bite out of his own salad. \"So what I wanted to tell you during lunch was that my feeding tube wasn\\'t removed until a couple of hours before I were discharged,\" Gabriella told Troy quietly as they stood in the hallway talking after school. Gabriella had managed to eat most of her soup during lunch. \"The doctor was a little reluctant at first to remove it but we agreed that if I managed to put on some weight until the next control then I wouldn\\'t need it,\" she admitted to her boyfriend. \"So that is why you want to eat but not necessarily manage to,\" he said and she nodded. \"I just want to become independent again and put all of this behind me.\" At lunch the next day Gabriella wasn\\'t really looking forward to eating but she knew she had to. \"Brie you want to eat at the roof? I thought about what you said yesterday and I think I can help,\" he revealed to her and she looked at him curiously. \"Sure,\" she told him with a smile. \"We\\'ll meet you later. Troy wanted to show me something,\" Gabriella told her friends and Taylor smiled. \"See you later,\" Taylor told them as they continued towards the canteen. \"What did you have in mind?\" Gabriella questioned intrigued as her boyfriend found two containers and some plates. \"I know for a fact that you have liked Etrean food so I decided to make some more Asian styled recipes,\" he told her and opened the boxes. \"I made some traditional spring rolls with noodles, chicken, carrot and fried eggs. I also made Thai styled fried rice with carrots, egg, rice, pork and spices,\" he explained to her and she smiled. \"It looks really good,\" she said taking one of the spring rolls. \"I think I\\'ve only eaten spring rolls from Chinese take-out,\" Gabriella shared taking a bite, \"but this is so much better. Did you make them?\" Gabriella questioned Troy impressed. \"Yeah. It isn\\'t that hard once you have everything ready. I made a large batch and frozen it for later,\" he shared and Gabriella took another bite. \"Mmm. So good,\" she said and Troy smiled. \"Here. I have a feeling you\\'ll like this too,\" Troy told her handing her a plate of fried rice. She looked curiously at the rice mixed with pork, egg and carrot before taking a bite. \"Wow,\" she said surprised. \"This was good,\" she told him scraping up the last of the small potion. \"I am glad you liked it,\" Troy smiled as Gabriella took some more. \"Who thought you these recipes?\" she questioned curiously finishing her spring roll. \"When my grandmother and grandfather had a trip to Thailand to meet with King Bhumibol, I was allowed to travel with them. While my grandparents were attending the meetings I got the opportunity to learn some traditional Thai recipes along with some more modern. When I came back home I tried some of them and they turned out to be quite successful,\" Troy told her while she was eating another spring roll. \"Oh I\\'m so full,\" Gabriella proclaimed as she finished the last spring roll, as lunch were coming to an end. \"I am glad to hear that,\" Troy laughed and Gabriella cocked her head frowning. \"Well, the amount of food I took with me is usually intended for a family of four to five,\" he revealed placing the lid back on the two empty containers as Gabriella started laughing. \"Don\\'t worry about it,\" he continued. \"I am just happy you ate something you really liked,\" he told her and she smiled. \"Yeah I finally felt like I was really hungry and that it actually tasted good,\" Gabriella shared just as the bell went off. \"Come \\'on we\\'re late,\" she giggled and they hurried down to their classes. \"Hello Troy how was school?\" Lucille greeted him as he entered the house. \"It was good. Gabriella really liked the food which was good,\" he told his mother and emptied his backpack. \"That\\'s good,\" Lucille smiled following her son into the kitchen. \"Do you have much homework for tomorrow?\" she questioned him and Troy looked at her. \"No I don\\'t,\" he answered and Lucille nodded. \"Okay. I think there is something we need to talk about,\" she told him and he frowned. \"Is it something bad?\" he questioned a little fearfully. \"No,\" Lucille told him quickly her eyes soft. \"All right,\" he agreed and they sat down on the couch. \"I think you need to know that Adrianna called me while Gabriella were in the hospital. She asked me if we should meet when she was in Iwaki for a meeting but I told her I was here and why. A little while later she called me back and somehow Makayla was also there during the call. She thought it was you Troy, who had committed suicide,\" Lucille shared openly with her son letting the news sink in. \"Somehow Calvin also got to know about it and Calvin feels really bad about something that happened during Christmas. What I do not know but I have a feeling you do?\" Lucille questioned her son who sighed. \"Yeah I do. I\\'ll make sure to talk to all three of them,\" Troy promised thinking. \"Good. There was also one more thing. I thought about going back home within the next couple of days would that be all right or do you need me to stay?\" she questioned looking at her son. \"I guess that\\'s all right. I mean you had things you needed to do back home,\" he told her scratching the back of his neck. \"Those can wait if you need me here Troy know that all right? Family is always more important,\" she told him sternly. \"I know and thank you mom, but I think I\\'ll be fine on my own until the summer,\" Troy confessed and Lucille nodded. \"I had a small feeling you would say that so I thought about leaving tomorrow evening if that were all right with you?\" she questioned. \"That sounds all right,\" he agreed. Wednesday 20 th 12:00 AM After lunch the next day the seniors had PE, but Troy was still excused from class seeing as he wasn\\'t allowed to do any sports just yet. He was currently sitting on the bleachers, watching as Gabriella emerged from the lockers giving a note to the teacher. They spoke briefly before she made her way towards her boyfriend. \"Hey not attending class?\" he questioned as she sat down beside him. \"Nope. With everything that has happened the doctor didn\\'t encourage me in doing physical activities until my next appointment,\" Gabriella explained looking at him. \"So neither of us are attending PE for what, the next two weeks?\" he questioned and Gabriella nodded. \"Yes,\" she said and took his hand intertwining their fingers. \"My mom told me something yesterday and to make a long story short. Makayla and Calvin heard about what happened and Calvin feels really bad about what happened at Christmas. I promised mom I would speak to all of you soon because he had something he wanted to tell you,\" Troy shared as the rest of the class emerged ready for the lesson. \"Ok, but do you know why it happened?\" she questioned quietly not wanting everyone else to hear their conversation. \"Well,\" he told her hesitantly. \"You do know,\" Gabriella told him and he sighed. \"I am not a hundred percent certain if this is the reason but I think I know,\" Troy started telling her the story. \"For all the years I\\'ve spent Christmas with them it has just been the three of us who have been the same age. Suddenly I leave to study abroad and when I do come home for Christmas, I bring someone new with me who they have no relation to at all. Makayla did not mind seeing as the two of you got along great but for Calvin there was someone else who I spent my time with. I reckon that was the reason for why they dragged me off with them one of the first days. When you called and said you were lost, I knew I had to come and find you seeing as you had no way of finding your way back. However, both of them knew their way around the house. Because of this I think Calvin were a little jealous that I spent less time with him and more with you,\" Troy shared quietly not looking away from her. \"Why couldn\\'t he have said or implied anything? I wouldn\\'t have minded if you wanted to spend more time with your family,\" Gabriella told him frowning a little. \"Honestly I don\\'t think he really wanted to admit that he might have been a little jealous. So the day we went riding together I know he had an argument with the family. He argued about the fact that we let you spend the holidays with us. He claimed that you didn\\'t really love me for me. That you were more interested in the title,\" Troy added quietly making sure no-one overheard their conversation. Gabriella looked at her boyfriend in shock. \"That is not true,\" she defended, \" I know that ,\" he hurried to reassure her before continuing, \"and apparently Makayla knew that to which I assume you told her?\" he questioned and she nodded. \"Anyways, what I heard was that Araya and Makayla were sent outside while the adult spoke together. Mom then shared with them about how we really meet and what did happen when I decided to tell you the secret,\" Troy told her. \"So now your family know all about our relationship and how we met?\" Gabriella questioned uncertainly and Troy nodded slowly. \"I am sorry. I had hoped that they would have found out differently,\" he apologized. \"Which reminds me,\" he continued, \"Do you have plans this weekend?\" \"No what about it?\" she questioned looking at him curiously. \"Mom were planning on leaving tonight so I was wondering if you wanted to come over on Saturday?\" he questioned and she smiled. \"I\\'d love too.\" Saturday 23rd On Saturday just after lunch Gabriella arrived at her boyfriend\\'s house. \"Hey how are you,\" he greeted her placing a gentle kiss to her lips as she walked inside. \"I am good. Are you glad to be alone again?\" she teased him with a smile as they walked inside to the living room. \"Well to be honest yes. It was good to have her around for the time being but I don\\'t mind being alone too,\" he shared smiling. \"So did your mom say anything about when you had to be home?\" he questioned and she nodded. \"She really wanted me home for dinner so six,\" Gabriella told him and he nodded. \"Sounds good. I spoke to Calvin and we agreed to call at four our time but first I wanted to give you something,\" he informed him. \"Troy you didn\\'t have to,\" Gabriella told him but he ignored it. \"I didn\\'t want our parents to know exactly so I had to wait until mom left,\" he informed her and gave her a box. \"What?\" she questioned confused and took off the wrapping paper. Frowning and in awe she opened the small box. A single key laid there and she took it in her hand looking at it. \"What is this?\" she questioned looking at her boyfriend confused. \"It\\'s a key to my house. I wanted to give it to you for valentine\\'s day but I figured out our mothers didn\\'t need to know. Whenever you feel alone or just need some company I want you to know that you can always come here. Now whether I am home or not,\" Troy told her and she wrapped her arms around him. \"Thank you Troy. It means a lot.\" Hope you all enjoyed this chapter! Comments are always greatly appreciated! -FreeFlyingWriter'][Chapter 32] ['Thank you Grace, Guest and pumpkinking5 for your reviews on the last chapter! I am so terribly sorry that it has been so long since my previous update. Unfortunately, a lot has been going on in my life since last time and sadly writing, in general, had to take a back seat for a while. Luckily I am on my Christmas break and sick so I have had the time to finally get this chapter up! Hope you all like it! –Sadly editing has not been done, so all mistakes are my own- \" It\\'s a key to my house. I wanted to give it to you for valentine\\'s day but I figured out our mothers didn\\'t need to know. Whenever you feel alone or just need some company I want you to know that you can always come here. Now whether I am home or not,\" Troy told her and she wrapped her arms around him. \" Thank you Troy. It means a lot.\" Gabriella\\'s POV Monday March 3 rd After speaking to Calvin and Makayla about a week ago I felt like we had moved on from everything that happened during last Christmas. Calvin had apologized about what had happened and given an explanation as to why, which were pretty much what Troy had told me during the PE lesson. Everything had eventually returned to normal, and school were focusing more and more on our graduation in June. At my last doctor\\'s appointment, they told me I were gaining the weight that I should but I couldn\\'t stop taking my medication despite how much better I were feeling. Today, our history class had been cancelled last minute, because our teacher was sick with the flue. After being told we were allowed to leave the class Troy had come up to me and questioned if I wanted to go up to the rooftop garden with him. So despite it being early March we were sitting on the bench in the garden. I was sitting on his lap with his arms wrapped around me keeping me warm. \"Troy?\" I questioned him turning my head to look up at him. \"Yes?\" he questioned meeting my eyes. \"I just realized you never told me one important thing,\" I stated and he frowned a little. \"What could that be?\" he questioned puzzled taking my hand. \"When your birthday is!\" I exclaimed and he gave me a small smile. It was nothing like the usual and he almost looked a little sad? \"I told you mine.\" \"How could I forget? Your born 14th of July,\" he stated looking at me. \"I guess I didn\\'t tell you because of everything going on, it didn\\'t seem that important,\" he stated but I looked at him. \"Come on. Don\\'t tell me we have passed it,\" I told him but he shook his head. \"No. I was born the 10th of March 1990,\" he told me and my eyes widened. \"Troy you\\'re turning 18 in a week!\" I exclaimed looking at him in disbelief. He only shrugged his shoulders. \"It didn\\'t seem that important with everything else that were going on. It isn\\'t much to celebrate anyways,\" he told me gloomy, shrugging his shoulders. Studying the features of his face I noticed the light in his eyes were gone. The smile that he always had on his face just wasn\\'t there. \"You\\'re really not excited are you?\" I questioned him quietly as I realized, and he nodded slowly. \"I used to be when I was a kid,\" he shared softly after some time. \"According to this ancient rule when one turns eighteen one are legally allowed to claim the throne,\" he recited and I looked at him a little puzzled. \"If something were to happen to my grand-parents, my parents will be the one to take the throne. Now if they are un-able to it will be passed down to me and I am not ready for that,\" he confessed his voice getting thick. I swore I could see a small tear glistering in the crocks of his eyes. He looked away from me as I took his hand. \"Troy,\" I started softly but he didn\\'t look at me. \"You still have years to prepare,\" I tried to reassure him and he meet my eyes before I continued, \"your parents will help you before it\\'s time. I will never know what it feels like to have that kind of pressure but know that I will always be there for you,\" I assure him and now I could see the genuine happy smile returning to his face. \"Thank you Brie,\" he told me leaning down to kiss my lips softly. \"You always make things better.\" \"I need your help,\" I stated to the other girls as we were gathered to practice for the musical. \"Troy is turning eighteen next Monday and I really think we should plan a surprise party for him,\" I shared with them. \"That\\'s a great idea. When could we have it?\" Taylor questioned and Sharpay started looking at dates. \"If we want to have it as close to his own birthday as possible it should be this weekend, which would be the 7th or 8th,\" Sharpay shared with us all and they looked at me. \"I think it would be the easiest to do it on Friday. That\\'s the 7th right?\" I questioned and Taylor nodded. \"I will ask mom if we can have it at my house. It would make it the easier to get him there without suspecting anything,\" I reasoned with them as they nodded agreeing. \"I can ask Zeke if he could help with food preparations. His cooking is amazing,\" Sharpay gushed and we all smiled. \"I can try to inform the guys and make sure they know it is a surprise for Troy,\" Taylor volunteered. \"Regardless if we can have it at my house or not I can ask mom if she could make a batch of her brownies,\" I volunteered. \"They are so good,\" Taylor gushed but we were interrupted by Ryan. \"All right, let\\'s get back to it,\" he called us all and Kelsi smiled looking at me. \"Come on,\" she told me with a smile helping me up from the floor. \"Mom?\" I questioned that evening while we were eating dinner. \"Yes?\" she questioned looking at me. \"Could I have someone over on Friday after school?\" I questioned and she looked at me. \"Who would that be?\" mom questioned interested. \"I learned today that Troy\\'s birthday is next Monday and we thought about having a surprise party for him this Friday. \"I don\\'t see why not,\" mom told me without hesitation. \"Who would come?\" \"Just the usual gang. Taylor, Chad, Troy, Jason, Sharpay, Zeke, Ryan, Kelsi and Martha,\" I listed to her. \"Sounds all right. Would it be all right if you were home alone?\" she questioned and I smiled. \"If we could,\" I told her smiling slightly. \"A couple of people from work are planning on going out next Friday for a drink. We shouldn\\'t be too late,\" Maria told her daughter. \"That\\'s fine,\" Gabriella told her mother. \"Would you need any help?\" she questioned me and I nodded. \"Sharpay were going to ask Zeke if he could make some food, mostly American dishes, but if you could make a batch of your brownies,\" I questioned her. \"I can do that. Let me know if there should be anything else.\" Friday March 7 th \"So I will ask him to come over a little while later. How much time would we need?\" I questioned Taylor who looked over at Zeke. \"About an hour?\" he suggested. \"Sounds good. Then I\\'ll ask him to come around five?\" I questioned them and they nodded. \"Chad told me he has his car and the same with Sharpay so we are probably going to drive there. Is your mom home?\" Taylor questioned looking at me. \"I don\\'t think she will be. She told me here the other day she wouldn\\'t be home until later in the evening,\" I told her. \"So if I am walking home with Troy then you\\'ll need this,\" I told her and gave her the key. \"Thank you. Hopefully we would have started by the time you come home. Were your mom going to make the brownies?\" Taylor wondered. \"Yes, she put the batch in the fridge so all we had to do is bake it,\" I reported to her. \"Got it. I will send you a text if there is something urgent but we should manage until you come,\" Taylor assured her friend. \"Good. I have to see if I find Troy before practice. See you,\" I told them and hurried out of the room. Walking down the hallway towards our lockers I found Troy not long after. \"Hey Troy. So I was wondering if you would come over a little later? Mom reminded me about something I had to do after school so I have to postpone it a little,\" I told him and he nodded. \"That\\'s fine. What time then?\" he questioned me. \"Around four?\" \"Sounds good. I have to run, if not I\\'ll be late for practice,\" he excused himself closing his locker door. \"Okay. Walk together after school?\" I questioned and he nodded. \"I\\'d love too,\" he answered me and gave me a quick kiss on the cheek before he hurried down the hallway. My hand went up to touch my cheek and a smile formed on my lips. He had no idea. \"How is everything going?\" I questioned Taylor as I found her in the kitchen along with Zeke. \"We\\'re good here. Zeke is working on the food which should be ready in time,\" Taylor told her friend and looked at Zeke for confirmation. \"Yes we are good here,\" Zeke confirmed putting a lid on a pot. \"Good it smells really good,\" Gabriella said with a smile. \"I think you should check with Sharpay, Chad and Jason who are doing the decoration. Martha, Ryan and Kelsi are somewhere discussing something about the musical,\" Taylor informed her friend. \"Yell if you need anything,\" I told them before walking into the living room. Chad and Jason were currently blowing up a pack of balloons while Sharpay were tying several of them together. \"Everything all right?\" I questioned looking at the three of them. \"We\\'re great,\" Chad assured her tying a knot on the balloon. \"Yeah,\" Jason breathed looking at the half inflated balloon. He shook his head before he started inflating it again. \"Tell me if you have any questions,\" I told them and Sharpay smiled. \"We will,\" she assured me before I walked back into the kitchen. \"So when did you ask Troy to come?\" Taylor questioned me as I were finding the plates. \"Around four,\" I told her looking at the clock. 3:40PM \"The food should be finished any minute now. We decided to wait a little with the brownies since they are best while they are warm,\" Zeke told me and I nodded putting the glasses on the counter. \"Sounds good,\" I agreed turning to find the silver wear. \"Is there anything we\\'re missing?\" I questioned Taylor as she looked over everything. \"I don\\'t think so,\" she stated looking around. \"We\\'re finished with the decoration. Do you need any help?\" Sharpay questioned as she entered the kitchen a little while later. \"I think we\\'re just about done too,\" Zeke announced turning down the heat of the stove. \"Great he should be here any minute now,\" I announced just as Ryan, Martha and Kelsi came. \"So should we all hide and really surprise him?\" Sharpay questioned looking really excited about the idea. \"Really?\" Chad questioned but Kelsi had a smile on her face. \"I think it\\'s a great idea,\" she encouraged while Taylor and Martha were both nodding agreeing. Just then there was a knock on the door and I looked at all of them. \"Come on,\" Sharpay said and they all moved into the living room hiding. \"Shh!\" I heard Ryan hiss and I frowned while a smile playing on the corner of my lips. \"Hey Troy,\" I answered with the same smile as I opened the door. \"Hey Brie,\" he told me and walked inside. Once I closed the door he leaned down kissing my lips softly. I blushed knowing that the others must have heard us, being so close. \"So did you finish helping Maria?\" \"I did,\" I lied nodding my head. \"Come on I want to show you something,\" I told him and guided him inside the house. Troy\\'s POV Gabriella seemed a little hesitant as our lips meet in a kiss. Did she doubt our relationship after everything we have been through? Studying her face as we broke the kiss I saw the same features as when we first meet. The shy and smart girl I fell in love with. \"Come on I want to show you something,\" she told me and lead me into the house. With her leading the way I noticed how quiet the house was. Could Maria really be home? Walking inside the living room I did not expect the sight that met me. The entire Wildcat gang jumped up shouting, \"Surprise!\" I looked at them startled not quite grasping what just happened. Something warm were gripping my hand and I knew at once it was Gabriella\\'s even without looking. My eyes were still fixed at the scene in front of me. After what felt like several minutes, but it could not have been more than half a minute, I managed to put on a smile – although it never reached my eyes. At any other occasion I would be much more cheerful about the fact that my friends had arranged a party for me but not this year. Anyone else would have walked straight into the crowd, despite how small or large, with a much more genius smile or enthusiasm. Not me - not this year. My feet almost seemed plastered on the floor making it impossible to move. But somehow I convinced them with my smile and managed to walk a few more meters inside the room. \"How?\" I questioned puzzled as Chad had a bright smile on his face. \"That\\'s easy. It was all Gabriella\\'s idea,\" he stated looking at her. \"Well, I couldn\\'t have done it without you guys,\" she shrugged smiling a little. \"Thank you, everyone. I did not expect this,\" I told all of them and at this point, a genuine smile spread on my face. Sharpay glanced at me flashing a smile and her loud voice shot through the air breaking the short, but eerie silence, as she threw herself into singing happy birthday. Within the first sentence ending everyone joined her happily. It was late. I hadn\\'t looked at the clock for several hours but the darkness outside showed me it was late. Maria had never been home. It was just something she made up to pull off the surprise party. \"Did you have a good time? I know what you told me earlier about your birthday but I felt that we could not celebrate it,\" she rambled and I smiled. \"I had fun, Brie. Thank you,\" I told her kissing the top of her head. \"I actually enjoyed finally spending time with everyone and I am pleasantly surprised about Zeke\\'s cooking and your mother\\'s brownies,\" I grinned and she smiled. \"They are the best,\" she confirmed putting the towel down on the counter. Looking at my girlfriend I could not help but smile. Never in a million years did I ever think that I would be granted the opportunity to live a seemingly normal life. Of course, my parents were wonderful and tried their very best during my childhood but it had its limitations by being who we are. As a result, my parents did not tell me who I was until the year I started school. Believe me, I do not grudge their decision, but it made me have to find my place in society once again. All while I was starting first grade that same year. I meet Marcus at school, who seemed familiar somehow. Turns out it was his father I thought he looked like, seeing as he was working in the technology and research sector. I had seen him around the castle a couple of times… Marcus and I became friends pretty fast. He saw me differently than everyone else. He looked past the fact that I was a prince who might have something to do about his father\\'s work? To this date, I still do not know, but I am immensely grateful for our close friendship. He somehow became the brother I never had, and for several years he celebrated Christmas with our family. Sadly, he announced to me about two years ago that they had to move away. They moved west to a town called Ueta. It is a good 8 ½ hour away by car so visits became rare. Despite having him as my best friend school became a problem. As a consequence, my parents decided that it was for the better if they hired a private tutor for me. It really gave me an advantage in learning while at the same time I got the opportunity to travel with my family overseas. Therefore, by the age of eight, I could almost speak Thai, Arabic and French fluently. English and Japanese I spoke by the age of 3, and Chinese the year later. The same year Marcus announced his move, I decided to try regular school again and I enrolled in the same school he would have gone too. It was strange to return and I got reminded once again why I choose not to attend public school. I was lucky after Christmas and meet some exchange students from abroad. They were from Japan, Singapore and China. I had a great time hanging out with them, but we never formed a close friendship. Today I do not have contact with any of them. As a result of my best friend moving away and school not becoming any better I asked my mom if I could study abroad. After a long discussion involving my dad and my grandparents, we decided on America and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Just shy of a week later I started an argument with my parents about security. I did not see it necessary to have Ted, or security, shadowing me at school because no-one knew who I was. My parents, especially my father and grandfather, thought differently. After several days of discussions, we agreed on that I did not need security unless they discovered who I truly was or another threat arose. Needless to say, the \"talk\" we had after I revealed that I wanted to tell the truth to Gabriella was not pretty. After some persuasion, they saw my side of the case and mom convinced dad that I was fine. Then again when the rumours around school leaked about who I was they pushed on the subject again. I narrowly managed to avoid security, but I do have a suspicion that they have organized some form of protection… Needless to say the fact that I and my family haven\\'t seen eye to eye on every subject I am still immensely grateful for everything they have done for me. I realised as I grew older how fortunate I have been despite being in the centre of attention. My family really did their best in trying to give me an almost normal childhood, and the people surrounding me really loved me for me. Now as I have lived almost seven months in Albuquerque I have friendships that I want to treasure and memories I want to keep forever. Looking at Gabriella standing beside me, I only get a bigger confirmation about what I have experienced. She truly loved me for who I am and I do not intend to let her go. I thought about Troy reflecting a little about his life as he turns 18 and I also wanted to sum up the bits that have been scattered across previous chapters. Did you like the way it turned out? Please let me know I always love reading your feedback! Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! -FreeFlyinWriter'][Chapter 33] ['Thank you so much to Grace and Pumpkinking5 for your lovely reviews on the last chapter! Grace I smiled so much reading your comment, and I did promise you all that updates would come, eventually. I really try to post twice a month on the Saturday. Often around midnight European time (my time zone is UTC +1) which equals to around six o\\'clock East American time. So THANK YOU for that encouragement and kind words! Sadly, this chapter has not been edited as much as I would have liked to seeing as school have started again and I am reading theory for taking the theory test to get my driver\\'s licence. I have approximately four weeks to do it! Ugh, wish me luck… Troy\\'s POV Monday March 10 th \"Happy birthday!\" Gabriella hugged me as she meet me at my locker. \"Thank you,\" I smiled taking out my Spanish books. \"How was the rest of your weekend?\" she questioned me and I continued to smile. \"Quiet but good. Marcus called me yesterday wishing me a happy birthday not quite having figured out the time differences.\" \"Really?\" she looked at me arching her eyebrow. \"Mhm. He called just after noon Etrean time which meant that it was nine the previous day here in America. He meant it well,\" I told her sincerely but couldn\\'t hold back the laugh. \"Be nice to him,\" she nudged me while I closed my locker. \"I am,\" I defended as we walked together towards class. \"He\\'s the brother I never had, or sibling for that matter, so that\\'s what we do. He got plenty of stories on me though,\" I stated shaking my head. \"Really?\" She seemed surprised. \"Yes,\" I confirmed with a slight nod of my head. \"Aren\\'t royalty supposed to behave to perfection every time? At least that\\'s what every tabloid is writing about whenever someone isn\\'t,\" she shared quietly. \"Aha. Your answer in your question,\" I stated and she looked at me puzzled. \"Key word being tabloid and behaviour. There is a fine line to not get caught by the paparazzi, but I haven\\'t always been that fortunate. If you google my name I am sure you will find plenty,\" I told her and she were just looking at me. \"To be honest,\" she started and I knew she were going to confess about having googled me. Why wouldn\\'t she? \"I can\\'t say I have. I think I did once but that was to show mom when we broke up…\" she told me and I were slightly shocked. \"God I regret that.\" \"You haven\\'t?\" I questioned her and she shook her head. \"I didn\\'t see the need. Of course I won\\'t lie and say I haven\\'t been tempted to do it, but I never went through with it,\" she confessed as we entered the classroom. \"That\\'s why you really wanted to know my birthday amongst other things,\" I realised and she nodded. \"Yes,\" she nodded as we sat down in our seats. \"We\\'ll talk more later,\" Gabriella told me as she watched as more and more students entered the classroom. \"Lunch,\" I told her and she smiled nodding. \"Hey hoops you okay with training today?\" Chad questioned me as we were walking out of our last class. \"Yeah wasn\\'t it planned?\" I questioned him a little confused and he looked at me funnily. \"Well yeah but after what happened with your family I wasn\\'t sure if you wanted to skip this one,\" he told me uncertainly and I frowned. Surely my mother would have called me or sent me a text? \"Wait, where did you hear this?\" I frowned looking at him as Taylor and Gabriella were meeting up with us. \"It was all over the news just a while ago,\" Chad stated finding his phone looking for the article. \"What\\'s going on?\" Taylor questioned having noticed our face expressions. A beep on my phone alerted me on a text and my heart started thumping inside my chest. Was this a text from my mother? I pulled up my phone and surprisingly enough it was from Marcus. \" Sorry to hear about your grandfather. Hope it\\'s nothing too serious and wishing you all the best,\" it read and my heart dropped into my stomach. \"Here,\" Chad announced and showed me his phone. Royalty rushed to hospital. His royal highness king Alexander of Etrea were observed rushed to the hospital in the early morning hours. No comment has been given so far but an update is expected to come within the early morning hours. \"Thanks,\" I muttered handing him his phone back. \"Shit you didn\\'t know did you?\" Chad exclaimed as it dawned on him. \"No,\" I shook my head swallowing hard. \"I am so sorry,\" he apologized profusely shoving his phone back into his pocket. \"You couldn\\'t have known,\" I defended him shrugging my shoulders. \"Stuff like this is bound to happen,\" I shrugged it off before turning to Taylor explaining. \"Chad just showed me an article about my grandfather. He was rushed to the hospital for some un-known reason. Marcus, my best friend, just sent me a text asking if everything was all right with him, but I haven\\'t heard anything until just now,\" I told her and her eyes shot up in surprise. \"Oh wow,\" she stated astounded. \"So if you want to join us we\\'re alone in the gym today. Coach had some meeting so we\\'re in charge today. I can handle it if don\\'t want to that\\'s cool,\" Chad rambled and I smiled. \"Yeah no it\\'s okay. I\\'ll be there just have to make a call first,\" I told him and he nodded with a smile. \"No problem hoops.\" \"Could we also come? To watch I mean,\" Taylor clarified and Gabriella laughed. \"Yeah sure no problem,\" Chad stated and Gabriella smiled. \"We should get going,\" Chad stated noting the time and I sighed. I pulled out my own phone and the message from Marcus were still staring back at me. \"We could give you some privacy if you need,\" Gabriella told me thoughtfully and I gave her a small smile. \"It\\'s all right,\" I stated as students were walking past us. I found my mother\\'s phone number and put the phone to my ear. \"Hello Troy,\" my mother\\'s voice greeted me. \" Hey mother. I heard about grandfather from a friend. How is he doing?\" I questioned her switching over to Japanese. \" We do not know yet. He was admitted for some different testing about twenty minutes ago. I am sorry I did not call you at once. It all happened so fast,\" mom explained regretfully. \" I understand. What happened? And how is sobo taking it?\" I questioned and Gabriella looked at me at the mentioning of the word. She remembered the Japanese word for grandmother… \" She wasn\\'t there. She is in Hiratsuto at a conference. Hopefully by the time she arrives we know more, but tell me, how did your friend hear about this?\" \"He saw it on the news and then I got a text from Marcus. School just finished so we are on our way to practice,\" I briefly explained as everyone passing us didn\\'t seem to notice me speaking a completely different language. \" I will let you know once we hear anything. Hopefully it would be soon,\" mom told me and I nodded. \" Thank you mom. Talk to you later.\" I told her as we bid our goodbyes. \"So you and Taylor seemed to have fun during practice,\" I teased her as we were walking together home. \"Yeah,\" she giggled. \"We were actually finishing some stuff for our next scholastic decathlon meeting. We are only a month away from the final competition so we have lots of practice to do,\" Gabriella told me as I smiled. As I watched them they seemed to be talking quite a lot as they were sitting on the bleachers with a couple of books laying open beside them. \"When is your final match and do you know against who?\" Gabriella questioned but at the same time my phone was buzzing in my pocket. Looking at the screen I read the letters MOM. \"It\\'s mom,\" I apologized and accepted the call. \"Hello,\" I answered a little anxious hoping she had good news. \"Hello Troy. I am sorry I don\\'t have much information yet but your grandmother has arrived and the only thing they told us is that he is stable at the moment but they are still doing tests,\" mom informed me and I frowned. \"But what happened to him?\" I questioned concerned. \"He had been working in his office all night and he passed out when he stood up according to what we were told,\" mom explained and my heart sunk. \"So what does this mean for my studies?\" I questioned and Gabriella looked at me worriedly. \"We just have to wait and see. I am sorry but that\\'s all we know. Worst case, he has to step down which means that you will have more responsibilities. However, seeing as you have around three months left until the summer we should make it work,\" mom told me and I didn\\'t know what I was going to say. I knew this day were going to come eventually but as I told Gabriella just a couple of days ago, I was not ready. Now on the day I turn 18 I am faced with exactly that possibility. \"Don\\'t stress yourself out with this Troy. For all we know it was nothing serious and he will be just fine,\" mom tried to reassure me as I got quiet. \"Thank you for the update, keep me informed will you?\" I questioned. \"Of course bye,\" mom said and I hung up. Gabriella didn\\'t say anything, but her look said more than thousand words. She wrapped her arm around mine leaning closer. \"I am here for you Troy,\" were the only words she spoke. I put my pencil down on top of my open notebook with a sigh. Ever since the news about my grandfather I were having a hard time concentrating. The lack of news was not helping either. I looked up, glancing at the clock hanging on the wall in the kitchen. 8:30 I looked at my phone once more and the same blanc screen were glowing back at me. I turned my attention back to the English book trying to finish the homework, when I heard noises coming from the front door. It sounded like a lock being turned with a key, and I thought of Gabriella. I stood up and headed towards the entrance as the sound of a door opening and closing came. \"Troy?\" Gabriella\\'s uncertain voice were heard as she locked the door behind her. \"Hey Brie,\" I smiled as I saw her. \"Hi,\" she answered as she put her backpack down on the floor. \"I\\'m sorry for just entering but I thought you might need some company?\" she questioned looking at me. \"Don\\'t be sorry Brie. This is exactly why I gave you the key,\" I explained to her as she took off her jacket and shoes, following me into the kitchen. I started closing the books and gather the notes while she was looking at me. \"You can finish if you were in the middle of something,\" she told me as I put them at one side of the table. \"No it\\'s fine. I haven\\'t really been able to concentrate much,\" I explained to her turning to face her. \"So you haven\\'t heard anything?\" she questioned stepping closer. \"No.\" \"So um,\" she stated a little nervous. \"mom said that it was okay with you I could stay the night,\" she told me and I smiled. \"I would love for you to,\" I stated wrapping my arms gently around her waist, kissing the top of her head. She stood up on her toes giving me a proper kiss on the lips, while I brought her a little closer supporting her. \"Do you want to watch a movie or something?\" I questioned her as we broke the kiss. \"I would love to,\" she grinned and we headed into the living room. \"So I was meant to bring this for Kelsi tomorrow. Something about a project or inspiration,\" Gabriella stated as she pulled out a movie cover from her backpack. \"Um?\" I questioned confused looking at the cartoon covered movie. \"Shh, give it a chance. It\\'s a beautiful movie,\" she stated showing me the cover more closely. Looking at it, there were a deer, a rabbit, a skunk and a dark green forest with a much larger deer half lurking in the background. The title read Bambi in a quite bold font. This really gave me the same vibe as The Lion King but then again she was right about that movie. It was a great kid\\'s movie, and I happened to like it too. \"I trust you,\" I told her as she started the movie. We both sat down on the couch and she snuggled into me as the movie started. I wrapped an arm around her playing with her hair as she rested her head on my shoulder relaxing. I woke up by a sound and something vibrating. I looked around to see that it was my phone which I had placed on the coffee table earlier. Carefully I stretched for it as Gabriella had fallen asleep on top of me, her head resting on my chest. \"Hi mom,\" I greeted her quietly as I had somehow managed to answer it without disturbing Gabriella. \"Hello Troy. Sorry to call you this late but I have good news. Your grandfather was just discharged from the hospital. They found the reason for his blackout being due to stress. The doctors strongly advised him to reduce his schedule and we even briefly spoke about him stepping down which he refused to at the moment,\" mom stated and I smiled a little. \"Good luck getting him to ease his schedule,\" I laughed quietly as mom sighed. It was really no secret that grandpa loved what he was doing and all the traveling. He was just naturally engaged in events happening all over the country and meeting with the people, is something he loved doing. \"Thank you Troy I think we might need it,\" mom chuckled. Monday March 17 th Easter break had finally arrived and I were happy about having a week long break from school. It defiantly gave me more time to practice basketball seeing as the doctor had approved me starting to play a little. This also meant that I had time to do my Japanese semester tasks which had to be finished before the summer. I knew for a fact that both Jason and Zeke were traveling somewhere to meet up with some relatives, which left only me and Chad from our group to meet up. I had just finished cleaning up after breakfast when I could swear I heard a car pull up in the drive way… Maybe I were just imagining things? I knew for a fact that Chad had his licence and sometimes borrowed one of his parents\\' car but he, usually, called in advance. There were a knock on the door so I walked over and opened it not expecting the person that stood on the other side. \"Marcus?!\" I questioned completely taken back. \"Hey long time no see,\" he stated and I were still shocked. \"Yeah more than long enough. Come in,\" I said stepping aside letting him inside. \"What are you doing here?\" I questioned frowning a little as we shared a hug. \"It is Easter break and Flower blossom festival back home. A little planning with my parents and yours, and here I am,\" he laughed at my shock. \"This is awesome! How long are you staying?\" I questioned him now grinning. \"Until Sunday afternoon. Your school starts again Tuesday right?\" he questioned and I nodded. \"Dude I can\\'t believe you\\'re here,\" I told him bewildered and he laughed. \"Your mom said just about the same thing. Obviously our surprise worked,\" Marcus stated and I nodded. \"I can almost guarantee you will meet several of my friends during this week,\" I told him as he looked quite excited about the prospect. \"Yeah I were hoping too. I took a chance that you did not have any plans when I decided to come. Oh and maybe I can finally meet this girlfriend of yours who you loved enough to reveal the whole reason why you travelled here,\" he pointed out and I couldn\\'t do anything else than to laugh at his description \"You will most defiantly meet her during the week and don\\'t you worry, I plan on dragging you along,\" I stated and laughed at the expression on his face. \"Oh dear, what have I gotten myself into?\" So that was it! Did you see it coming with Marcus visiting?

I hit writers block and by the time I figured out where I wanted to take the story school got crazy for two weeks straight. When I finally had the time to write and edit I got asked to join the training of new members in Red Cross which was a great opportunity that I couldn\\'t say no to. As that weekend went by I got sick with a bad cold and I stayed home from school for a week straight. Finally, I am feeling much better and I have been writing as much as I could. You all are seriously amazing for sticking with me during my crazy update schedule! I am trying my hardest to update about twice a month but sometimes life happens and you have to prioritize. Thank you so much for your lovely reviews Grace and pumkinking5 you have no idea how much you inspire me to keep on writing with your comments! Honestly Grace I also did not expect Marcus to show up either but I thought what if and then it happened! *laughing* Troy\\'s POV Tuesday March 18 th It still hadn\\'t completely dawned on me the fact that Marcus was here in America. Last night I made enchiladas which he tried and loved. Gabriella had called me in the early hours asking if we should spend some time together and maybe try and finish up a project we were working on. After explaining that Marcus had arrived yesterday she was even more excited about coming over and meeting him. Hench, Gabriella were coming over at noon. \"So Gabriella is coming over at noon,\" I mentioned to him putting down the two bowls of breakfast on the counter in front of us. \"Exciting,\" Marcus grinned reaching for the chop sticks. This morning I had opted for a more traditional Etrean breakfast. Gyudon. A simple and easy dish consisting of beef and onions laid on top of rice. \"So how is it going living here alone?\" he wondered placing each of the wooden sticks in his hand. \"I really enjoy it here,\" I grinned sitting down in the chair beside him. \"Of course it was weird in the beginning, getting to know a whole new culture by myself, but I feel like I have somewhat adapted by now. Still, I am learning something new every so often,\" I commented taking my own pair of chopsticks as Marcus had already started eating. \"Have things changed much back home?\" I wondered turning to look at him taking a bit of my breakfast, thinking about how little attention I have paid to Etrean media. I didn\\'t realize my own grandfather were hospitalized for crying out loud! \"No not really,\" he shrugged looking down into his food. \"I mean in the start the media were really curios when they never saw you anymore. In the end they gave up, but when a rumour leaked that you were studying abroad they desperately tried to figure out where. Then just after Christmas when the tabloid leaked that picture, it was a circus all over again. Everyone were investigating which flight you took and what not trying to figure out which country, but after a month they gave up. Now they are still trying to figure out where you are and who you were with that day, but they are having no luck so far. At least I haven\\'t seen anything,\" Marcus stated picking up another piece of meat holding it in between his chopsticks. \"Have nothing really reached international media?\" \"No,\" I laughed. \"Thank goodness for that. I also love the fact that absolutely no one at school have made a connection besides a small rumour that died down after a week or two.\" \"School back home has changed a little. There is more academic pressure as finals are coming up soon along with last minute applications. Besides that, school is school I guess. The uniform policy has not become any stricter, rather the opposite.\" \"In all the years I have known you I don\\'t think I have meet anyone else describing school in so few words,\" I laughed at him as Marcus were just smiling. \"Come on,\" he mocked, glaring at me, \"you know I hate school in Ueta. I cannot wait until college starts in September and I am finally moving to Saint Germains.\" Marcus hadn\\'t minded when his parents announced their move but in the years they had lived in Ueta he hadn\\'t really settled. After what he had shared with me he wasn\\'t exactly un-happy there, but most of his friends were still living in Iwaki. \"To be honest I agree with you,\" I told him seriously as he frowned. \"What?\" \"Living here for the past seven months without anyone knowing who I really am, I have given me a whole new perspective about the world and who I am. I actually like it here and leaving will be bittersweet. I have built my life for several years and leave it for ten months. Then I build a life for ten months and leave it forever. No matter if I return nothing will be exactly the same. We would all have graduated and moved on. It is happening for every one of us, weather we\\'d like to or not,\" I told him philosophically and Marcus stopped for a moment. \"I guess you\\'re right. Life back home will change to. I mean we are actually moving out, living our own lives, making our own choices that will affect us and our future. You are just a year ahead already,\" Marcus laughed as I cracked a smile at the statement. \"So you are not taking Japanese as a class here, how is that working with the graduation requirement?\" \"It is going surprisingly well. I got the curriculum before I left with filled out assignments and deadlines. All I have to do is email it to my tutor on time. The rest of the requirements were mostly meet before I even started this exchange.\" \"Have you started the Japanese end of semester task yet?\" I nodded looking at my best friend. \"I have. After reading the curriculum I realised how big of a task it turned out to be,\" I told him with a sigh, \"but I don\\'t really see how I will manage to have it finished with all the work we are giving at school, plus being involved in basketball and theatre.\" \"Right… How did you end up in theatre? I knew about basketball but theatre?\" \"It started out as helping Gabriella, but this year everyone in our class got signed up without knowing. In the end we all agreed that it would be fun to do something together as a class,\" I reasoned as Marcus nodded slowly. \"What about you?\" \"Me? Well we just heard about the assignment last week so we could start during the holidays, but I am having some trouble too,\" he admitted. \"Why don\\'t we work together to see if we could help each other out?\" \" Harmony, order and self-development have been important values which have become the foundation of the Japanese society. Mixed with a rich history and long traditions Japan have become an important country in the growing globalization of the world ,\" Marcus read from the notebook I had started writing in. \"This is a really good beginning. So you are going to write about values in the Japanese society, history, traditions and globalization.\" I nodded watching as he placed the notebook on the table. \"Yes. I hope that it will meet the requirements of in depth analysis and length.\" \"I think it\\'s too much to hand write a research paper this detailed using hiragana, katakana and kanji. Fair enough they want to test our knowledge but it\\'s not like this is our last year with Japanese,\" he huffed taking his own paper, writing notes. \"I see your point and to be honest I have to agree. We still have four years of college, and four more years of Japanese. To be honest I am really tempted to take the exam early and be done. Hopefully I could pass the curriculum within the first year,\" I confessed as Marcus looked up from his paper. \"Really?\" he questioned astounded. \"Why?\" Shrugging my shoulders, I looked at him. \"I guess why not? I mean I learned Japanese fluently when I was young and throughout the years I have just completed the assignments because I had to. At the moment the tasks that I am doing is more time consuming than challenging.\" I didn\\'t notice how much time had passed until I heard the front door open and presuming that Gabriella were the one to enter. \"Hi,\" Gabriella announced as she stopped in the doorway surveying all the books and notes scattered on the table between us. \"Hey. Marcus meet Gabriella, Gabriella Marcus,\" I briefly introduced them as Marcus stood up. \"Nice to meet you,\" he said, shaking her hand with a smile. \"You too,\" Gabriella smiled before she curiously looked at our work. \"What is all of this?\" she questioned as I glanced at the table. \"Oh this,\" I gestured towards all the papers. \"We were just working on our Japanese project.\" \"Right,\" she stated awkwardly not knowing what to do. I knew she was shy but had I made the situation that awkward for her? Was it the introduction to Marcus or was it the fact that we were doing homework? I knew from previous experiences that she never like interrupting me when I was trying to do homework, but this was something we were dong to pass time. \"Hey how do you spell depression?\" Marcus questioned breaking the building tension. Shit, why did he have to mention that? The incident was still rather fresh for all of us, but he didn\\'t know. Just everyone else… \"Come on, we\\'re soon finished,\" I invited Brie before looking at my best friend. He was my brother but sometimes he reminded me a bit too much of Chad. No filter. But then again, how could he know when no-one told him? I had to ask Brie if it was okay if I told him some of what happened. It had to be her decision. \"Just out of curiosity what does that have to do with Japan? Aren\\'t they within the top three statistics of happiest people on earth?\" \"True, which makes it an excellent statement to prove and investigate why,\" Marcus stated confidently and I shook my head grabbing a piece of paper. Quickly I wrote the two small characters before I showed it to Marcus. He quickly glanced at it before shaking his head. \"I know how to write it, but not I kanji!\" \"Why do you have to make it so difficult for yourself?\" I shook my head as I had to think. \"It should be something like this,\" I told him as I started to write, or more like draw it. I felt the sofa dip slightly beside me which meant that Gabriella must have sat down. She was getting more comfortable which made me relieved. I seriously had to talk to here. I never wanted her to feel this insecure around my friends. Was it the fact that I had known Marcus for the past 12 years and her barely 7 months? I would never shut her out just because I had known him longer. Despite the fact that we met each other in August, she was just as important to me as Marcus were. \"It should be something like this,\" I stated showing him the piece of paper. \"The stroke count isn\\'t correct though. I think it should be 29 strokes.\" \"That is one word?\" Gabriella questioned baffled as I saw her look at the paper. I nodded. \"Mhm, but if you put it beside another kanji it could have a whole other meaning. The Japanese language is built on three types of written alphabets. They are hiragana, katakana and kanji. Hiragana and katakana is the easiest. That were the first one I drew,\" I explained to her showing her the piece of paper. She took the paper out of my hands and looked at the two characters. Pointing at the one I had just drew to Marcus I explained, \"Kanji makes up the meaning of the words while the katakana and hiragana make the sounds of the alphabet. However, kanji is the written alphabet used in China and seen as the more formal one in Japan.\" \"It seems awfully complicated,\" she hesitated a little, her eyes moving towards my notebook. \"It\\'s really not that bad. It always seems overwhelming in the start but when learning Japanese you usually start with hiragana which will take you a long way.\" \"Right,\" Marcus added closing his book. \"I think we\\'re done for now. There\\'s no point in doing this when Gabriella\\'s here.\" And there is the more considerate Marcus I first got to know. I glanced over at Gabriella to see her smile a little. I wrapped my arm around her shoulder bringing her just a little closer towards me. \"Is everything all right?\" I murmured into her ear as Marcus had walked out of the room. She nodded not giving me a complete answer. \"You sure?\" I questioned kissing her temple gently. \"Yeah, just a little intimidating. He threw me off with that question. He doesn\\'t know does he?\" I sighed shaking my head. \"No, I didn\\'t tell him,\" I shifted a little as she leaned even closer towards me. \"I thought about asking you if you wanted him to know, and don\\'t say yes just because he\\'s my best friend. I won\\'t be hurt.\" \"It\\'s ok. I think I can trust him. I mean he kept your secret,\" Gabriella stated quietly as footsteps were heard. \"You sure?\" I questioned just as Marcus entered the room. Looking at us Marcus frowned, worry etched on his oval face. It was rare seeing him without his usual smile. He almost didn\\'t look like himself without it. \"Is everything okay?\" he questioned as Gabriella nodded not looking away from me. \"It\\'s nothing you did wrong,\" I started as he slowly sat down in the opposite sofa. Marcus frowned a little, his dark brown eyes looking at the two of us. \"You\\'re starting to worry me Troy.\" His normal buoyant mood was gone, replaced with worry and uncertainty. Taking a second I didn\\'t really know how to proceed. How do I tell my best friend that the girl sitting beside me tried to commit suicide a mere month ago? \"A month ago,\" Gabriella quietly started taking my hand, intertwining our fingers. \"I came to a breaking point. A rumour had been going around school about who Troy really were and because I am very involved with the math and science team at school people started picking on me.\" Gabriella stopped and I knew this was difficult for her. The memories from that night came back to me giving me chills. All I could see were her passed out on the floor… I gave her hand a gentle squeeze just to assure myself that she was really there. \"It had been going on for a month,\" Gabriella continued taking a deep breath, her voice quivering. \"It got worse. Much, much worse… It, it got to, to a point where I. Where I, actually tried…\" her voice faltered. Her breaths were somewhat shallow and I looked at her. Tears were gathering in the corners of her eyes. I couldn\\'t find the right words to say. Was there anything right I could say? Gabriella tried speaking again, her eyes glued to the floor. \"I tried to… Tried to kill myself. As in suicide.\" \"Oh gosh. I am so sorry to hear that. I hope I didn\\'t upset you earlier,\" he apologized but she shook her head. \"No,\" she sniffed as I kissed her temple softly. \"You didn\\'t. I, I just thought you needed to know. It happened just a month ago after all.\" Gabriella looked up, her eyes moving towards Marcus, their eyes locked for a moment. \"Shit,\" he muttered dragging his right hand through his short brown hair, shifting his usually neat hairstyle. As he sunk down in his seat I knew he had not expected what we just told him. \"I did not expect hearing that… I am sorry, you are better now?\" \"Yes, much better. Troy and our friends really helped me. I guess it\\'s worth mentioning that Troy gave me a key to his house so I am here quite a lot even though I live just down the street,\" she giggled a little as the small sound made me smile. \"I am happy to hear that. Now I am interested in hearing more about how your life here in America is.\" \"Yes!\" Gabriella exclaimed grinning, \"and I want to hear more stories about Etrea.\" \"Why don\\'t I make lunch and we could talk more? I am still making Etrean food for Gabriella to try.\" \"Troy come on. Join me on one party, even Taylor will be there,\" Chad argued trying to convince me. Chad\\'s older brother, Chucky, were hosting a party at University of Albuquerque tomorrow evening and had invited Chad and by the sounds of it, many more. \"I don\\'t know. I had plans with Brie and Marcus is here.\" \"Ask if they want to come to. I wanted to meet Marcus and Taylor said she would be there. Just ask Gabi all right? We don\\'t have to stay long, just a couple of hours.\" \"I will ask them,\" I caved in, \"but I won\\'t promise anything. If either says no, I am not coming.\" \"Fine, see ya later,\" Chad proclaimed and hung up. Sighing I started at the screen for a moment before I dialled Gabriella. Why did I have a really bad feeling about this evening? \"Hey Wildcat,\" her cheerful voice greeted me as she answered. \"Hey Brie listen, about Friday. Chad just called and asked if we wanted to joint this party his older brother was hosting. I told him no as I have plans with you but he persuaded me into asking you. Marcus were also invited but I haven\\'t said anything to him. This is your decision and Chad informed me that Taylor would be there too.\" \"Hmm, I guess it won\\'t be that bad if Taylor agreed to go. She isn\\'t into parties that much either but what about Marcus?\" Scoffing I had several memories flooding my mind, with various outcomes... \"He wouldn\\'t mind either way,\" I replied dryly. \"So you\\'ll go? Don\\'t feel like you have to say yes just because Chad is trying to drag me out.\" \"I know Troy, but honestly I want to. I\\'m sure it won\\'t be that bad if Taylor agreed to join.\" \"All right, I\\'ll let Marcus know. He has a car so we could meet them there and leave early if we want to.\" \"Sounds good I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\" March 19 th Wednesday \"Hello,\" Gabriella announced as she entered the door. I smiled as I walked over and greeted her with a kiss. \"Hey.\" \"Do I look all right?\" she giggled doing a small twirl. She looked stunning in her simple floral dress that she had accessorised with a brown belt around her natural waist. A pair of small red earrings drew attention to her face. \"You look beautiful Brie, as always,\" I stated as she blushed. \"Thank you Troy. You look good too.\" I smiled a little as I took her hand, leading her into the house. \"Marcus should be down any minute now. Did Maria say when she wanted you home? I would hate to get you in trouble for staying out too late.\" I lead her into the kitchen where I hopped onto the counter bringing her close. She brought her hands around my neck, stepping closer. \"Mom wanted me home by two o\\'clock, but to call if we somehow got delayed. \"Hey lovebirds you ready?\" Marcus called interrupting us. Gabriella blushed profusely as I just laughed. \"You have the worst timing you know that?\" Shrugging his shoulders, he just looked at the two of us. \"I don\\'t know what the two of you do alone,\" he pointed as I swatted his shoulder walking past him. \"Ouch,\" he grinned following us. Marcus parked the car and there were no doubts about arriving at the right place. A couple of beer cans were already strewn on the lawn and the loud thumping music were clearly heard. \"I thought you said it would be a quiet party?\" Taylor remarked watching as a couple of people stumbled out the front door. \"That\\'s what Chucky said but you know. It\\'s a frat party. Endless drinks everywhere and school is out for the week,\" he pointed out and he did have a point… A couple stumbled out the front door looking rather tipsy, as the music became more audible. The couple were giggling and talking quietly towards each other, clearly in love. \"Come on.\" Chad\\'s voice brought me out of my thoughts and I watched as he leaded us towards the house. \"Chucky wanted to meet you guys.\" Entering the house, the music seemed to become much louder as some pop song were playing. Several people had gathered in the living room where the furniture\\'s had been moved, probably to make it the \\'dance floor\\'. A table were filled with different drinks and empty beer bottles. I watched the people as some were making out while other were simply talking. A couple of people stumbled past us headed for the drink, trying to find a beer bottle actually containing beer. As Chad lead us inside and towards the kitchen I couldn\\'t help but notice how hot and sticky the air felt like. The lack of light not helping the gloomy feeling the room gave me. \"Hey Chad! I didn\\'t think you guys were coming,\" Chucky greeted us, almost yelling over the loud music. There was no doubt that they were related. Chucky looked almost identical to Chad except that his shoulders were broader and he was at least a head taller, standing at 185cm. \"Wouldn\\'t turn down an opportunity to see you, and a party is just a bonus. I want you to meet some of my friends. You already know Taylor but this is Troy his girlfriend Gabriella and Marcus who is a friend of Troy visiting from Etrea,\" Chad introduced us all. \"This is my older brother Chucky. He\\'s a senior her at U of A.\" \"Nice to meet you all. You two from Etrea eh. Thought you both looked familiar,\" Chucky smiled a little as I were shocked. Marcus frowned looking at me. \"What?\" Chucky smiled a little looking at Marcus and I. \"I am majoring in Asian relations with a focus on the south east.\" Marcus burst out laughing, \"So much for keeping that a secret Troy.\" I nudged him in the sides gently. \"Can you make it any more obvious?\" I questioned him as Chucky were laughing at the two of us. Despite the drunk people stumbling past us and thumping music, I was actually enjoying myself. Even Gabriella and Taylor were having fun on the dance floor. Marcus was no-where to be seen. He had disappeared a couple of hours ago with some of the college kids, probably enjoying himself. \"See I told you they were here,\" Chucky stated as he were walking towards me. One of the other guys looked at me. \"You were right, he\\'s really here.\" \"How did you meet?\" the third guy questioned as Chucky and his friends walked up to me. \"Hey Troy. This is two of my classmates, James and Keith,\" he introduced us. Shaking their hands, I looked at their faces which held disbelief. \"Nice to meet you both.\" \"I had to introduced you guys. Neither of them believed me when I said that there were two people from Etrea here,\" Chucky explained almost a little apologetic. \"No, don\\'t think about it. So you\\'re all studying Asian relations? Have you ever been to Etrea?\" Keith shook his head. \"No, I wish though.\" \"Yeah,\" James added. \"It\\'s such a beautiful country. Especially during the flower blossom festival. I wish I got to see that once.\" Keith nodded agreeing \"Yeah you should. If you\\'re ever there give me a call and we could meet up?\" I questioned as all three of them seemed interested. \"We\\'d love to.\" \"Have you meet Marcuse yet?\" \"Yes, he was just outside,\" Chucky motioned with his arm towards the back yard. \"Seemed to be enjoying himself.\" \"Good. I had no idea he would be coming, he just showed up on Monday. It\\'s nice to show him about life in America.\" \"Taylor,\" I stated catching her attention. \"I believe there is alcohol in the punch. How much have Chad been drinking?\" I wondered as she were shaking her head. A couple of hours had passed as the clock were nearing midnight. The music was just as loud as ever, and the crowd hadn\\'t thinned out the slightest, it almost seemed like even more people had joined the party. \"I should have known someone had spiked it,\" she muttered as I frowned at the expression. \"Spiked?\" She looked at me dumbfounded. \"Um, yeah. It\\'s an expression, but I think Chad have had one to many…\" Her eyes moved towards a small crowd of people where we could clearly see Chad\\'s bushy hair. Or was it Chucky? \"I didn\\'t drink any of the spiked punch so I could drive Chad\\'s car if you get the keys. I hope Marcus is sober as well.\" \"I haven\\'t seen him….\" Her voice faded as she looked behind me. I turned and watched as Marcus entered the room with a girl that were clearly interested in him. \"I\\'ll give him a warning,\" I promise Taylor not moving my eyes from Marcus. \"I will find Chad,\" Taylor said and she moved into the crowd. \"Hey Marcus!\" I almost yelled so he could hear me over the music. \"One moment,\" he told the girl as she giggled before he met up with me. \"Hey, something wrong?\" \"No, I just wanted to let you know that someone poured alcohol in the punch. Have you had any recently?\" Shaking his head, he glanced back at the girl. \"No. Nothing. Did you meet James and Keith earlier?\" \"I did but not now. Chad is drunk, or close to, so I\\'ll be driving his car home. Gabriella nor Taylor have their licence,\" I warned him but he was just as carefree as ever. \"Don\\'t worry Troy!\" he slapped my shoulder gently. \"Everything will be all right. I am responsible,\" he stated as I snorted. \"Don\\'t do anything stupid!\" I called out to him as he walked back to the girl. \"Never!\" \"Is he all right?\" Taylor questioned standing beside me. I laughed as she looked at me. \"He have never been, but he\\'s just like normal.\" \"Right, I got the keys from Chad.\" She held up the black key with basketball chain as she dropped them into my hands. \"Thank you Troy.\" \"No problem but do you know if his parents expect him home?\" \"I don\\'t think they do. He mentioned that he might stay here. What about it?\" \"I thought he could stay at my place. I recon his parents won\\'t be happy that he has been drinking. Isn\\'t the legal age 21?\" \"Yes you\\'re right. If you could that would be great,\" she stated relieved, giving a smile towards me. \"I wish I could have taken him home with me but my parents would flip if they saw him.\" Shrugging my shoulders, I glanced into the crowd to see if I could spot Chad again. \"Don\\'t apologize Taylor. I\\'ll keep an eye on him,\" I promised her, looking back at her as I weren\\'t able to see him. \"I should get back to Brie. She\\'s over there somewhere,\" I gestured looking towards the chair where I left Gabriella some minutes ago. \"It\\'s all right,\" she giggled as Chad wrapped his arms around her torso. \"Heeey beautiful,\" he slurred slightly. Laughing I turned to leave the two of them alone. He had never been shy in a crowd so he was probably fine on his own, or with that girl. \"Hey Wildcat,\" she greeted me as I sat down. \"Everything turned out all right?\" she wondered as she sat down on my lap, her feet over the edge of the chair and my arm around her back. \"Yes. Chad is drunk so I have his car keys and are going to drive his car back home. Marcus seems sober and disappeared with some girl. He should be fine,\" I laughed as she rested her head on my shoulder. \"Can you drive with your wrist?\" Her concerned voice made me smile as I kissed her forehead. \"The doctor said I could start driving at my last appointment about two weeks ago but seeing as I don\\'t have a car,\" I shrugged and she smiled. \"Are you enjoying yourself? I know it isn\\'t exactly what you had in mind for tonight.\" \"I am having fun Wildcat, and you\\'re right. This isn\\'t what we planned to do but this is kind of fun too. Doing something different for a change. I have heard a lot about Chad\\'s brother but never meet him. Tonight changed that. Also Marcus seems to enjoy himself and he also got to experience an American college party along with us so I would say the night were a success,\" she finished giving me a kiss.

Also Marcus seems to enjoy himself and he also got to experience an American college party along with us so I would say the night were a success,\" she finished giving me a kiss. Troy and Gabriella stood by the front door looking at Taylor who had a rather tipsy Chad following. \"I am glad you had fun Brie,\" Troy stated taking her hand looking into her eyes. \"I actually didn\\'t think I\\'d enjoy myself at a college party but with Chad and you there, everything becomes more interesting. Also, Marcus and Taylor were a great bonus,\" she giggled as Troy also smiled. Troy looked around for Marcus and spotted him with the same girl he had been with earlier. \"I thought about driving Taylor home before taking Chad back to my place. Would you be all right driving back with Marcus?\" \"Sure, I don\\'t mind.\" \"Good, then he won\\'t get lost,\" Troy teased as he saw Marcus coming. \"Yeah see you,\" Marcus told the girl as she headed over to one of the many crowds. \"Who won\\'t get lost?\" he questioned as Gabriella shook her head. Troy didn\\'t reply at once as Chad now came with Taylor in tow. \"We\\'re ready to leave,\" Taylor confirmed gently nudging Chad out the door. \"Leaving?\" Chad questioned confused turning to look at his girlfriend. \"But I didn\\'t even get to say bye to Chucky!\" Shaking her head Taylor grabbed his hand leading him towards their cars. \"You already did sweetie. Don\\'t you remember?\" \"Ya know,\" Troy commented turning his attention from the couple towards his best friend. \"Usually the sober one have to drag their drunk friends from the party.\" Placing a hand on his chest, Marcus made a face. \"Ouch. Why do I have a feeling that was meant for me?\" Laughing Troy unlocked the door as Taylor helped Chad into the car. \"Hmmm,\" Troy pretended to think for a minute before shrugging his shoulders. \"No idea.\" \"Well at least the police aren\\'t involved most of the times when I am driving,\" he called back as Troy burst into laughter. \"Nice one!\" he called back before he got into the car. \"Just so you know\" Marcus stated as he started the car, \"my sense of directions isn\\'t that bad.\" \"Good to know,\" Gabriella replied as Marcus turned out of the parking lot. Turning onto the main road they could spot the other car not far in front of them. \"I think I should give you an explanation about what just happened. So, we both got our licence as we turned sixteen. Troy in March and I at the end of July. Troy came to visit me that summer and a mutual friend of ours had a small gathering. Long story short, the gathering escalated into a quite large party and someone had, of course, brought alcohol. After a couple of drinks, I became a little tipsy and had no grasp of what the time was. In the end, Troy dragged me out of there at three in the morning.\" \"It\\'s a good thing you look out for each other. I know many people don\\'t do that at parties and the outcome isn\\'t always that fortunate.\" Marcus didn\\'t say anything, just thinking about what she had said. \"Troy is like a brother to me. Both of us being an only child, the relationship came naturally. To be honest I don\\'t think much about it. All I know is that was what I would want my brother to do, besides I have had my chances to return the favour.\" Gabriella chuckled as a question came to her mind. \"How is drunk Troy? I have a hard time imagining how he would be.\" \"Some people state that people ultimately end up in certain categories when they are drunk but I don\\'t believe that\\'s true. Troy turns out to be happy and carefree. I won\\'t describe it as the overly cheerful and happy types you normally witness. He acts more like a normal teenager without the pressure of who he eventually will be, and to be honest if you didn\\'t know him personally you couldn\\'t tell he was drunk,\" Marcus disclosed as Gabriella frowned. \"So you mean he shows no signs of being drunk as we are being told? No slurred speech, no incomplete sentences, no trouble walking?\" Gabriella questioned astounded as Marcus smiled. \"No, not really.\" \"So Troy did tell me a little about the two of you but when did you move?\" \"I was the summer of 2006 a year and a half ago, the year we turned sixteen. Did Troy ever disclose why he choose to do this exchange?\" Marcus questioned and Gabriella nodded solemnly \"I can\\'t help but feel sorry for him,\" she started letting out a sigh. \"As he choose to return to school you had to move away and in the end, he decided that the best option would be to travel halfway around the world away from everyone he knew.\" \"In a way it tells us a lot about how bad he truly had it, more than he shared at the time. I know for a fact that he spent quite some time with Ted\\'s three children, especially the two oldest as they are about his age. Both at his home and theirs. As far as I understood it was usually when his family were travelling abroad.\" \"I know what you mean,\" Gabriella stated ever so regretfully. \"After he told me the secret about who he really is, he shared with me his worries. Especially after I spent Christmas with him I gained a better understanding about what he was talking about.\" \"Did he tell you anything special about his 18th birthday?\" \"You mean the fact that he could legally taker over the country?\" she questioned as Marcus nodded, not taking his eyes off the road. \"He did. The news about his grand-father didn\\'t help the situation either.\" \"To be honest I haven\\'t seen him as happy as this in a long time. I think one of his greatest fears is suddenly having to take over the throne. He has been preparing for this for quite a while but you never expect to suddenly have to take over a country. Especially as we\\'re not even finished with high school, let alone college.\" \"Yeah, I couldn\\'t imagine being in that situation. But from what I have seen I am sure he will do a great job when the time comes.\" \"Take a left here,\" Gabriella commented as she saw the sign and Marcus switched on the turn signal. \"What was it about the comment with the police?\" Marcus smile chuckling a little. \"As Troy became the brother I never had we tease each other quite a lot. The thing is whenever Ted or anyone is driving him, there usually are several cars including a police car in a motorcade.\" \"I noticed that.\" \"Right,\" Marcus nodded. \"But the thing is that Troy enjoys driving himself. Therefore, it has been more than one occasion where Troy has been the one driving, much to the dismay of the security team. I think Ted is about the only one who lets him do it.\" \"But why is that so frowned upon? I mean he got his licence why can\\'t they find alternative ways? Wouldn\\'t he be sticking more out with a police car than just driving a regular car?\" \"I know!\" Marcus exclaimed quickly looked over towards Gabriella, before focusing his attention back on the road. \"That\\'s what we have been arguing about too, but sometimes it feels like talking to a brick wall. Anyway, last time he drove to Ueta, where I live, he somehow managed to ditch security and come alone.\" \"I don\\'t remember security following us much during Christmas but Troy mentioned something about most of them having time off.\" \"Oh, they were there. It is true that many of them have time off but there are still several people on duty because of the church ceremony and the Christmas parade. Besides, Troy was never a fan of security following him every time he walked outside, so he asked to be left alone.\" \"And that really worked?\" Gabriella questioned uncertainly as Marcus nodded. \"To a certain degree.\" There was a pause as Marcus thought. \"Still, Ted is following him around just about everywhere as his personal security, and as threats have risen he was just forced to accept that he had to have security following him.\" \"He told me one of the best things about being here,\" she started smiling at the memory, \"was that no-one knew who he truly was. He got to be himself and explore a different culture as he wanted. Much the same as whenever he speaks about your adventures together,\" Gabriella explained as she laughed. Marcus smiled by the girl sitting beside him. \"I like you,\" he stated as Gabriella burst out laughing. \"I don\\'t mean… like…\" Marcus stuttered as Gabriella looked at him still laughing. \"Relax,\" she assured him. \"I didn\\'t take it like that and thank you, you\\'re not too bad yourself,\" she smiled as Marcus turned into their street. \"I live in the white house there,\" Gabriella pointed out as Marcus stopped the car. Reaching down to unbuckle herself she glanced at the house at is was dark. \"I hope I get to see you more before the holiday is over, maybe even in Etrea one day?\" His face was hopeful as Gabriella turned to look at him. \"During this holiday most defiantly, about Etrea who knows,\" she winked at him. \"Thanks for the ride,\" she added before she closed the door, walking up towards her house. March 20 th Thursday Walking into the kitchen the first thing Marcus saw was his friend sitting by the breakfast bar with his computer. \"Morning,\" he greeted him as Troy looked up. \"Morning, did you notice if Chad were awake?\" Placing the cup down on the counter he turned towards Troy shrugging his shoulders. \"Can\\'t say I did,\" he commented as he poured hot water from the kettle into his cup, following by a tea bag. \"What time did we come home? Two-ish?\" Marcus questioned before he continued as Troy nodded. \"That would approximately be six hours ago, as it is way too early to be up anyways, and based on your track record I would give him about three more hours,\" Marcus concluded as Troy snorted. \"Thanks a lot,\" Troy commented sarcastically taking a sip of his drink. \"Did you sleep at all?\" \"Barely. I felt like I went to bed at five and woke up just before midnight… Oh wait!\" he interrupted himself. \"That is exactly what I did,\" he stated dryly as Troy were just about to choke on the tea he was swallowing. \"Cheerful this morning ey? Oh, I know why. There\\'s no breakfast,\" he stated as he nudged Marcus lightly walking past. \"Let\\'s see what we can make,\" he questioned himself as he opened the fridge. \"I could have made pancakes but I don\\'t have milk… but I do have a lot of cooked rice.\" Troy turned to show him the bowl as he nodded. \"Yes please!\" his voice held a childlike enthusiasm, \"have anyone commented on the fact that you eat rice for breakfast?\" \"No, not really. I don\\'t know if anyone noticed.\" Marcus shrugged as Troy found the ingredients. \"I guess it is an Asian thing.\" Troy turned raising an eyebrow. \"Did anyone mention you tend to stereotype?\" \"Oh really? I hadn\\'t noticed,\" Marcus replied dryly as he took the avocado, cutting it into slices. \"What breakfast bowl is complete without nori sheets,\" Troy stated showing Marcus the package. \"Yes please,\" he agreed as Troy teared up a couple of strips adding it into the pan with the eggs. Hearing footsteps coming down the stairs Troy turned his head as Chad entered the kitchen. \"Good morning,\" Troy greeted with a smile as he saw the state his friend was in. His normal afro was now in a mess and he were dressed in the same clothes as yesterday. \"God, what happened yesterday?\" he questioned flopped down in the chair by the counter. \"The punch was filled with alcohol at one point and no-one noticed until you were rather tipsy,\" Marcus told him as Chad rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. \"Breakfast?\" he questioned as Troy handed him two painkillers. \"Yes please,\" Chad stated before he swallowed the two pills. \"How did we come home yesterday?\" \"I drove your car dropping Taylor off at home as Gabriella rode with Marcus,\" Troy explained adding another egg to the pan. \"Aha,\" Chad nodded ruffling his hair slightly. \"My head is killing me. Is drinking this bad?\" he questioned looking up at his friends. \"Not always,\" Troy shrugged looking at Marcus. \"Depends on how much you drink. Getting drunk or tipsy yes. Speaking from experience it gets better throughout the day,\" Marcus assured him as Chad groaned resting his head in his hands. \"I am never going to drink again,\" Chad muttered as Troy laughed softly. \"Eat up, drink some water and sleep for a while then you should feel better,\" Troy stated giving him a bowl of breakfast. \"Chopsticks?\" he questioned as Chad stared at the contents of the bowl. \"How is it possible to eat this with chopsticks?\" he frowned looking at the two of them. Shrugging Marcus took his own pair of chopsticks getting a piece of egg and rice. \"Suit yourself.\" \"I still don\\'t understand,\" Chad shook his head as he accepted the cutlery from Troy. \"Really you to hoops?\" he questioned as he watched Troy. \"Trust me if you don\\'t eat this with chopsticks in Japan you\\'re going to stick out like a sore thumb.\" \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever understand Asian culture,\" he stated tasting the foreign food. \"It really isn\\'t that complicated if you just look away from the history. Now I heard a rumour that you play, so I challenge you to a game later,\" Marcus stated pointing his chopsticks at Chad. \"Oh you\\'re on!\" Hope you liked the chapter!
