For the first time, i´m publishing a fanfiction that doesn´t belong to me. A Friend and colleague DSCWin, who sometimes helped me here with some stories, come up with this idea yesterday for the Greeks, so i give her my character (nichelle) and she asked me if i could publish this story. As for this story, it´s takes place during the morning of Ian and Toula´s 12 year wedding aniversary. Hhepo you like it and hhave a great reading time Dr. Serpico and DSCWin BREAKFAST MEMORIES Paris Victoria Miller jumped quickly when her alarm went off. She quietly silenced her alarm before slowly moving towards her sleeping sister's room. Nichelle was wrapped in her bed and looked so peaceful that Paris felt guilty when she started to shake her little sister away. \"G..go away,\" Nichelle squeaked pulling the covers over her head. \"Nia,\" Paris called continuing to shake her sister. \"We have to make mom and dad breakfast for their anniversary. Like we had promised.\" Nichelle whined softly and reluctantly pulled the blankets away from her head. \"Fine.\" She said still annoyed at her sister as she tiptoed after Paris, who helped her make her bed. They closed their bedroom doors as they wanted to make their breakfast more surprising and more special. Even though Paris had overheard her parents talking about going out to dinner and seeing a movie, she wanted to help their anniversary special. As they arrived in the kitchen both girls searched for something to feed their parents. They looked into the fridge and Paris didn't feel comfortable cooking on the stove. Paris heard something rattling behind her and saw his sister putting their box of Lucky Charms on the counter. \"No,\" Paris whispered as her little sister climbed onto the counter to grab the bowls from the top shelf. Paris quickly helped her sister down before she fell and set her on a chair at the table. The little girl looked as though she was about to cry and Paris had to think quick. Pouring a bowl full of cereal, she placed it in front of her sister to snack on while she went around the kitchen trying to continued to find something for her parents. \"Why not Lucky charms?\" Nichelle asked putting a small handful of dry cereal in her mouth. \"Mom and dad deserve more.\" Paris complained opening up the fridge to see what could be used to make a nice breakfast. \"We can always call Yjayja. She always knows what to cook.\" Nichelle suggested rushing to the phone. \"Don't call Yjayja, Nia.\" Paris whispered calling her younger sister by her nickname. \"If we call her, she'll call Thia Voula and Thia Athena. Mom and dad won't like that everyone showed up to see them.\" But when she looked up from the cupboard she saw that her younger sister was already on the phone. Talking to their grandmother. \"Nichelle come back here!\" Her older sister hissed starting to chase after her younger sister, dropping the the milk carton to the ground. \"You can't catch me!\" Nichelle screamed forgetting she was was on the phone with their grandmother. She let out a scream dropping the phone in their fish take causing Maria to wonder what was going on next door. Upstairs in their room, Ian and Toula sat up annoyed as their girls continued to scream and yell. Ian looked over at his alarm clock and both parents groaned as they climbed out of their bed to see what was the matter. By the time Ian and Toula arrived downstairs their two girls were covered in milk, cereal and were wrestling in the living room. \"What is going on here?\" Ian barked making his daughters to freeze and Toula no chance in defending her two girls as she had walked into the kitchen. \"We're sorry dad.\" Paris and Nichelle said standing up and held their heads down. Toula walked in with the phone which was still dripping water. \"Well, thanks you guys. You broke the phone.\" \"Don't so hard Ian.\" Toula said patting his arm. \"Girls, can you explain yourselves?\" Paris looked up at her parents as Nichelle started to cry. \"We were just trying to make you special breakfast.\" Pairs explained wrapping an arm around her sister's shoulders. \"It was for your anniversary.\" Nichelle squeaked rubbing the tears from her eyes. She barely made eye contact with her father. Ian reached down and picked up his youngest to hug her, as he wasn't trying to sound angry it was the fact he was still tired. \"Okay.\" He said rubbing her back as she wrapped her arms around his neck. \"Let's go see what you girls tried to do.\" Both Ian and Paris walked in while Toula was now handed Nichelle to be comforted. Paris had explained that Nichelle wanted to give them bowls of lucky charms but after not wanting to give them the cereal, Paris reluctantly mentioned that Nichelle had called Yjayja. Almost as if by a higher power, Maria came in to find milk, over the kitchen floor, cereal all over the counters and floors. She even saw that both her granddaughters were looking sad and scared. When she saw the scene, Maria started to laugh and slowly left the house much to Toula's and Ian's joy. \"Happy Anniversary Mom and dad.\" Paris said with the biggest smile she could give. Ian and Toula looked at each other and started to laugh. Despite the mess their kids had made, it was a very nice memory to remember for years to come. ","Summary":" Good Morning!

Here´s another story, this time, loosely based on the TV Show about the movie, but following the descriptions of the first movie. I hope you like this story and give me some feedback, in case i need to change or add anything. Good reading time Dr. Serpico IT'S A GREEK HOUSE FOR SURE So, once the wedding reception and ceremony ended, Toula and Ian, left for the airport, toward the honeymoon. Knowing her family, Toula suspected that the Portokalos would tell them where to go on Honeymoon, but for her surprise, no one said a word, nor gone take them to the airport, thus, the newly wedded couple, spend a lovely two weeks on Argentina, just enjoying the first days of marriage and of course, buying gifts to everyone. When they got back, as promised, the family didn´t wait for them at the airport, but sanded a messenger when they were still in Argentina, telling them to go to Zorba´s, as soon they arrived in USA. Oh yes, as they step inside the restaurant, Ian and Toula were received by a big and fat surprised party, once they got inside, the whole family, literally the whole family, came to embrace and kiss them, giving cheers and congratulation for the wedding. \"you two look great! \" Voula said, embracing both her niece and nephew in law \"how the travel gone, you two enjoyed? \" another cousin asked \"they were on honeymoon, of course they enjoyed the trip! \" Nikki replies \"Aw, my little girl\" Maria exclaimed, placing a hand on Toula's stomach \"how was it gone? \" she asked, embracing her daughter \"Ma, we just have been married for two weeks\" Toula said in her defense \"the Luck Of The Irish, didn't caught us yet \" Ian joked, upsetting Kosta \"my boy, you have the luck of the Greek, it's much better than Irish luck... And well... A bit of Argentine help\" he said \"okay... \" Toula Stopped the conversation \"Dad, you told us In the messenge, that this party was to show us the house you and Ma bought us\" \"yes, yes! \" Gus exclaimed \"lets go, see your new house, you can move right now. \" \"well... \" this time it was Ian who interrupted the conversation \"i confess that i'm more then excited to see the new house, but, moving in, will take a few days, as i need to get things from my apartment. \" \"about that... \" Nick started \"your things are already at the new house, Bud! \" he finishes and in response, Ian looked shocked and speechless \"DAD!\" Toula gasped, looking to her parents \"don't worry you two, we didn't break an entry \" Maria said \"Rodney and Harry helped us, we thought you two would like the surprise \" \"we liked but... \" \"so what are we're waiting for, lets go. Nick, you can take care of the restaurant please? \" the father said. To make the surprise more realistic, Maria and Gus blindfolded the couple, drive them to their house. To tell the truth, Toula was a bit nervous diring the car trip, but relaxed when Ian took her hand, assuming everything would be just fine. \"okay, here we are!\" Gus and Maria helped the couple out of the car \"welcome, to your new house! \" he said, taking the blindfold out. \"wow!\" It's all Ian could say, as Gus give him the keys \"Its a bit rustic outside, but very modern Inside\" \"and next door to us\" Maria smiled \"Ma, you guys bought the neighbor house to us?! \" Toula was shocked \"What's the problem? Athena liked to leave next door to us, especially at the first days of wedding. \"the mother said \"now come, let's go inside \" To be fair with the Portokalos, they didn't opened the boxes, just place them in different rooms and settled the bed, couch and freezer, so Ian and Toula could have a place to sit and sleep through the cleaning days. \"So, you two liked the house?\" \" Yes, we did. \" Toula said, not wanting to upset her parents \"We did.\" Ian agreed \"thank you very much\" \"Everything for the family Ian, you two are welcome\" said Kosta \"Now we will let you guys alone, to get some rest\" Maria smiled, going away with her husband. As her parents left, Toula throw herself on the couch and took a deep breath, not knowing what to say. Sure, the Greek woman indeed liked the house, it was awesome, but something inside her, felt that something wasn't right. ''this never going to work'' she moaned, making her husband laugh ''what? You didn´t liked the house?'' ''I love the house, it´s an amazing house, but it´s too close to my parents, I'm glad they give the house to us, but near like this, it will be easy to everyone spy on us.'' ''ow, come on honey, it´s isn´t that bad'' Ian seat down and wrapped his wife on a hug ''let´s do this thing, if they started to poke into our lives, we will have all the right to ask them to stop, otherwise we will move out,'' ''Ian, you´re wonderful, you know?'' ''you say it so much, I will get convinced it´s true, huh?'' he laugh as they keep seating there for a few minutes, holding into each other. _/_ As the week goes, all the Portokalos and even Rodney and Harry, come and goes into Ian and Toula´s house, to help organize things. Both husband and wife were glad for the help and more surprised they got, when neither of the family give opinion where the stuff should be placed, they only followed Toula´s lead and help put thing on the right place. Everything goes smooth. Then, the first and only incident happens. It was one night, exactly a month after the wedding, Ian and Toula found themselves in their new tided house, watching TV, when Ian decided to again try the ''Luck of the Irish'' thing, in the living-room. Toula of course, was more than excited to try again, but as they started to kiss and get unclothed, the front door opened and a cheerful yell of ''SURPRISE!'' almost make them fell out the couch. ''what the…? What is the meaning of this?'' Gus demanded to know ''oh God!'' Toula became red as a tomato, trying to cover herself as much as possible ''I think we had come on a bad time'' said aunt Voula ''are you trying again?'' Nikki asked and both Nick and Angelo nodded hopefully ''Ian, if you wanted privacy, why don´t you put a sign on the door, or simply locked it?'' the old man asked ''okay…'' ''oh, Gus don´t be ridiculous, there are in their house, they can do whatever they want'' Maria scolded ''OKAY!'' The whole family froze and looked at Ian, who looked back angry, it was the first time Toula saw him using that angry façade ''linden, we´re glad you give them the house, we really do, but it´s our house, Toula and I want some privacy on our own, so I ask, for our sake, no surprise visit, unless it is an emergency, you all are welcome here, but call first, ok?'' For a split of second, Toula thought Nick would punch Ian right in the face, however, to both husband and wife surprise, the Portokalos apologized and started to walk away ''I will call you tomorrow if you need me some help in the kitchen'' Maria smiled ''good luck to both of you'' ''you spoke like a true Greek, Ian, congratulations'' Gus pointed a finger to his son-in-law and go away. _/_ After that incident, no one give the young couple a surprise visit, sure, they visited regularly, but always asking permission first, as Ian demanded. As Thanksgiving approached that year then, Toula´s sister Athena called asking what her sister planned. It was Toula´s first Thanksgiving as a married woman and as for traditions, the date should be celebrated in her home. The problem was, that she didn´t knew what to do. ''what about pasta'' Ian suggested, when Toula told him about the thanksgiving ''pasta?'' ''yeah, like those with red sauces and everything else, to side the turkey'' Ian said ''Ian… I don´t know…'' Toula was in doubt ''well, you can blame me if they say something, you married a vegetarian guy, you have all the rights to do something I would be pleased'' ''sweetheart I would never blame you for anything'' the woman laugh, giving her husband a kiss ''well, if you say it is a good idea, then pasta it is'' Toula smiled, anxious to see her family faces when eating a different dish for thanksgiving. Blessed the time she decided to have Ian by her side. END ","Summary":" Hello!

Hope you like it Have a wonderful reading time and good night Dr. Serpico COLLEGE TOPIC \"So,\" Bennett asked all of a sudden making his girlfriend, Paris, stop to look at him. \"Have you made a choice of classes you're going to take in College?\" It was a spring afternoon in Greek Town and both teens decided to take a walk in the park with Patches, Paris' basset hound. They had just walked silently for a few minutes before Bennett broke the silence with his question. It was still awkward, as they had just gotten back together with each other after Paris had broken up with Clark. But since Paris was finishing up her first year of college she hadn't decided on a course she was interested in taking. \"I don't know, honestly.\" Paris said gently tugging on the leash making Patches slowdown from his slight jog. \"I'm kind of torn between two choices and I'm not sure what I want to go into. What about you? Have you decided?\" \"I chose librarianship.\" Bennett said looking at Paris with a smile on his face. \"The greatest librarians are Greeks and I love to read books. So it's a win, win in careers.\" They arrived in a small dog area in the park and Bennett saw Paris debating whether to go in or head back to her home. \"How about this, we'll let Patches run around a bit while we both help you decide what career choice you should go into.\" \"Well, I'm torn between Medicine and fashion so it's going to take more than just a few minutes.\" Paris said, not sure if she wanted to make Bennett stay for a long time. \"All the more reason to let Patches run.\" Paris smiled and nodded. Closing the gate to the dog area behind her, Paris bent down and unclasped Patches leash letting the basset hound to take off smelling every inch of the ground. \"So, what do you think I should do?\" Paris asked as they sat down on a bench in the park both of keeping an eye on Patches. \"In my opinion, \" Bennett said turning so that he can look in Paris' eyes. \"I think you should go into Fashion. It suits you.\" Paris let out a chuckle as she looked down at her clothes. She was happy she outgrew her 'Gothic' style when she turned 18 and she was happy she did. The bright colors seemed to make her feel a lot more cheerful. \"But now I would like to know what kind of medicine you're wanting to go into.\" \"I'm not sure it's a good idea.\" Paris said looking down at her feet as she nervously twisted them on the ground. \"I mean, I want to go into Cardiology.\" Bennett was silent for a few minutes. He gently wrapped his arm around her shoulders and gave her a gentle squeeze for comfort before letting her go when she smiled up at him. \"You'd have to take a lot of courses in medicine to get there you know that right?\" \"Yeah, I know.\" Paris said leaning back in the bench and watched as Patches came running back over to her and licked her hand before heading back to a bush to continue to sniff at it. \"That's why I'm in a lot of doubt if I even want to go to school that long.\" She leaned her head on his shoulder happy that Bennett was there. They watched Patches as a larger dog came bumbling up towards her and Patches instantly began to play with the bigger dog. Paris laughed to herself as she knew that once they would get home, the dog would need a bath, but she was happy that Patches would be too tired to fight her. \"What does Principal Miller think about your choices?\" Bennett asked. Even though they weren't in high school anymore he was still uneasy calling Ian Miller \"Mister\" instead of Principal. Paris didn't seem to mind him calling her dad Principal anymore. \"Well,\" Paris said with a shrug. \"You know how my dad is. Every time I asked his opinion he would say something like \"whatever you're happy about I'll be happy about it too\" and \"I support with any decision you choose\".\" \"What about the rest of your family?\" Bennett asked knowing that her large Greek family always seemed to have great advice when Principal Miller wasn't that much help. \"To be honest, they weren't much help with any of my choices. Thia Voula says I should go in fashion. Yjayja thinks I should be a teacher and Pappou doesn't care what I choose just as long as I get married soon. For as you know, \"We Greeks get married young...because as you know we Greeks make-\" \"Make great young couples.\" Bennett finished imitating the old man perfectly making Paris chuckle. \"Don't worry Paris.\" He said wrapping his arm around her again. \"I know you'll make a good decision. For as Mr. Portokalos always says. \"Greeks always make great decisions.\" ''yeah? You tell me, sometimes I think why I have chosen Northwestern in the first place, I should go to NYU'' Paris complained ''URGH! Shit!'' she was angry, but Bennett place a hand on her shoulder to calm her down. ''Hey, let's not go nuts yet, you still have time to think better about your choices and talk to your Dad about what you really want to do. In the meantime, why do not you list the pros and cons of each career, you can also talk to my cousin, even though she is a pediatrician, you can talk to her about the general medicine course. And read blogs about fashion, to choose '' he advised. ''yeah, thanks Bennett'' the girl smiled a bit awkward, trying to avoid look at him. ''you are welcome. Let's go to your home?'' he asked ''yep, I promise Dad I would make the dinner tonight. Let´s go Patches'' she called the dog who rush to her side. When they were about to leave however, they spotted a blond woman walking with her dog, after she get out of sight, Paris turn to Bennett and asked ''what you think if I die my hair blond?'' she asked ''honestly, I think you will be cute'' he said giving a small kiss on her lips ''but you´re cute in any way'' he said making her laugh as they make their way toward her house, now much more relieved and secure of her decision.

''Honey Mou!'' Maria smiled at her granddaughter ''hey Yjayja, I'm calling to wish you a nice mother´s week, I tried to call Yjayja Harriet but she was busy I think'' Paris said with sadness in her voice.

You shouldn´t be in class right now?'' she said ''want me to go pick you up?'' ''no Yjayja, I'm okay, it´s recess time.''

Just do me a favor, remember him to give Patches a bath, I don´t want my dog smelling'' she hushed to say ''I will, don´t worry, I see you Sunday then… don´t forget to eat and keep concentrated at class, but more important, remember, protect the poulaki. Love you honey mou'' ''love you too YjaYja, call you tomorrow'' Paris laughed and turn the cellphone off. Drying her eyes, preventing a lonely tear to fall, the teen decided to go back to the dormitory, to charge her phone, when it ringed again. It was a messenger from Ian '' Hi, Babe, how are you? I hope you've seen this message just after class, huh? Your old father here is missing you, come this weekend for your grandmother's mother's feast, I promise that if you come, I'll make that strawberry baklava you like. A kiss and study hard.

The poor woman had an heart attack less than a month ago and there she was now, fighting for her life, while waiting for a heart transplant. How couldn't he or the family haven't seen it early? They almost had lose her and Paris at the girl's birth, as the doctor told the family, Toula was having problems with keeping her blood pressure unstable. If they could have seen that, at that day and realized the woman was a cardiac defect, she probably wouldn't be dying right now. No, no dying, Ian shook his head, she wasnt dying, he wouldn't going to lose the love of his life. And Paris wasn't going to lose her mother. He had to be positive. At the bed, Toula coughed again, it was normal, Dr. Turner had said that due her condition, she was suffering some apnea and eventually, trouble sleep, since the air isn't coming straight. Getting up from the armchair he was sitting, Ian made his way toward the kitchen in order to make some lunch. Just some crackers and a cup of tea he know Toula would love. The house was empty despite of the dog, he had send Paris to have fun with her friends and Bennett. . _/_ Back at the room, Toula had woke up suddenly, with a small discomfort inside her chest. As a cardiac patient, she knew she should call for help quickly, still, she doesn't wanted to worry Ian even more and decided to keep quiet, it was probably the side effect if been in bed all day. Besides, seen her husband approaching the bed with a tray of lunch, made her forget such discomfort. \"Hey, you woke up\" he said, sitting the tray on the bed and bent down to kiss his wife. \"Well, who can actually sleep with this thing on their noses\" she complained \"where's Paris?\" \"I told her to go have some fun with her friends. Classes start a month for now and she needs some fun\" Ian said \"do you believe your dad convince Bennett to ask my permission to date our daughter?\" \" I wish i could be there with you babe \" she said \"You will have time to enjoy the responsibility of having a daughter dating, give it time, i called Dr. Turner and he said we're close to find a heart. If i have had realized you wasn't well earlier...\" That comment really hurt the frail Greek woman, as she felt guilty about not been there for her daughter entirely. Sure, she had seen and had the chance to meet Bennett at her parents wedding or at Angelo's dinner party. And sure had some 'security ' talk with Paris about dating, but after she had ended up in the hospital last weekend, she had barely left the house, her bed for instance. Still, she couldn't let her beloved husband take all the responsibility tor the event and said to him. \"Ian...\" Toula shock her heard annoyed, as if her husband had said a nonsense. To her relief, the discomfort had passed a little \"not even i knew i was sick, so cut it out.\" She said a bit angry \"okay, what we have here?\" Before Ian answer, she pick up the cup and give a slip, just to twinkle her nose \"Already cold?\" \" no, its that with this thing on my nose, i can't smell properly and due those medicines, everything taste like iron. And you? You going to have some dinner? \" \"I had a coffee downstairs and i think i will eat the rest of that pasta with cheese Paris had done yesterday.\" He said \" want some? \" \"No.\" Suddenly , a wave of sadness hit her \"Ian, could you lied down and hug me? I'm feeling a little cold\" upon hearing that, Ian paled. \"Are you feeling alright? Want to go to the hospital?\" \" I'm just cold, could you lie down with me please? And stop been so worried, i don't want you to have an heart attack\" she said and in response, Ian chuckled band lied down, involving Toula in a embrace. \"Better?\" He ask and she nodded \" you smelling good\" \"Ian, i'm may be dying but i still managed to take a bath you know? Paris helped washed my head today\" she said. Of course, Ian flinched at the word 'dying' but let our a false laugh in response. \"You remembered, when Paris was little, every Winter morning she came here and lied down between us and we slept all over again, all the three of us?\" Ian asked \" How i can forget it\" Toula laughed, but the laugh was interrupted by a cough. \"You know, when i saw you coming up with the tray, i remembered my first birthday as a married woman, how i was embarrassed when you bring me breakfast in bed\" she said. \"You made me the happiest woman ever\" Oh Yeah? To you know, i can't wait for your next birthday to arrieve, i will prepare a surprise... Paris and i actually. \" \"Huh? A surprise ? What it will be?\" \" babe, if i tell you, it won't be a surprise. \" Ian frowned and they laughed \"I wish this moment could last forever\" Toula suddenly felt a strange sensation \"We're both grown up enough to know nothing last forever\" Ian tried to make fun of the moment \" but we can repeat this moment, as long as we want\" he said and with a nod, Toula finally fall sleep again. _/_ Paris arrived home an hour later, worried, because her parents hadn't called her earlier. Then, as soon as she step home and place a bit of food at the dog's plate, the teenager rushed to her parents room. Once stepping there however, she couldn't help but smiled as she came face with face of both her parents sleeping at each other's arms. With a breath of relief and trying to be as silent as possible, she take the tray and close the door behind her, letting them sleeping. Little did she knew, it was going to be the last night she would ever see her parents sleeping like that. (IT ISN'T THE END, BECAUSE THIS SCENE TAKES PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF OTHER STORY .)

As she looked on the Instagram, nostalgically observing every photography, the 18-year-old girl did not realize her grandfather coming from behind her, giving her a scare. \"Paris, what are you doing?\" Asked the old man, looking a bit tired than usual. \"Hi Pappou, I'm just checking something's, while wait for dad\" she said. \"Hum...\" He growled \"what is this? \" he asked, as he set down \"What?

Here another story for the Greeks. This story however, it´s a bot different from the others, its covered the first 15 minutes of the secound movie, with a difference... Ian and Toula have two daughters instead of just one. so there´s Paris and her 12 year old sister Nichelle ''Nia'' Miller. Hope you like my story. Dr. Serpico. Thanks ColdWest for the support, DSCWin for the fixes and the support and Ashley for the great idea, you three and Jedi With The Elderly Wand, make this site much bright! TWO GREEK GIRLS It was like any other school day of the week as Kosta Portokalos, who woke up early to head to work, stopped by to pick up his daughter and grandchildren before driving away towards the high school. To him it was routine of a perfect day in paradise. For he believed his home in Greek Town, Chicago was a perfect place and his family made it all more perfect. Once he took the black Subaru out of the garage and had picked up his daughter and granddaughters he made his way towards his grandchildren's school. He looked in the rear-view mirror and let out a sigh. \"You better get married,\" He said to his oldest granddaughter. \"You're starting to look old.\" \"Dad!\" Toula said suddenly looking shocked. \"You can't say that to her.\" \"Pappou.\" The oldest granddaughter, Paris Victoria Miller, who was 17 complained. \"Why must you say that all the time?\" \"Don't worry Pappou,\" a small voice said next to Paris' side. \"I'll marry soon!\" The voice belonged to Nichelle \"Nia\" Miller who was 12 years old but she didn't let her age stop her from making her family smile and laugh. \"Has your father ever hear you say this?\" Toula asked smiling at how her daughter had the ability to ease any tension. \"Yeah, He said he would be very sad to see me get married.\" Nia answered with a smile. It was true that whenever Ian heard Nia say she wanted to get married very soon he would pretend to be sad but knew his daughter was just joking with everyone. \"Sadly you're still too young to get married,\" Kosta said looking in the rear view and smiled at his granddaughter. \"You'll have plenty of time to find a nice Greek boy to befriend and hopefully would move on to Boyfriend and then husband.\" \"Dad!\" Toula screamed. \"Toula, she's alright.\" Kosta said shooting her a look. \"Both of these girls need Greek boyfriend. Otherwise they will end up like what you did.\" \"What did I do?\" Toula asked confused. \"You married a Xeno. Not that he isn't a great man but he isn't Greek. You shouldn't let your daughters do the same thing.\" \"Are you telling how to raise my daughters?\" \"Both of you stop it!\" Paris and Nichelle both screamed making the two adults to stop. \"It's enough.\" _/_ The wedding/boyfriend subject didn't come back up on the rest of the trip to the school. Instead, Nia changed the subject by asking her grandfather to root words to make the trip less awkward. Toula however just kept shaking her head in annoyance. As soon as they arrived at the school, both Paris and Nia quickly jumped out of the car not wanting to sit in the awkward situation their mother and grandfather had put them in. Toula jumped out quickly before her daughters could get to far ahead. She reached her girls and pulled them into a tight hug. \"I'm so sorry girls,\" she said looking behind to look at the old man that sat behind the wheel. \"He likes to speak nonsense. You know you don't have to find a Greek boyfriend. You can love and marry whoever you like.\" \"Mom,\" Paris said in Toula's ear. \"You're suffocating us.\" Nia finished which made Toula quickly let go of them. \"Sorry,\" the Greek woman said trying to keep her cool. \"You two have a great day.\" She kissed her girls on the cheek and watched as they quickly headed for the school's front doors before she headed back to the Subaru and climbed inside. _/_ It was a busy day as the University Fair was almost at the school. Just as he always did, Principal Ian Garfield Miller, walked through the school to make sure everything was in order. He checked on teachers who were teaching their classes, students who sat in their seats some of them trying to misbehave but when they saw the principal staring at them fell still and quiet. He was nearing the cafeteria when he heard two voices chatting away in hushed voices. He moved closer and saw the younger of the two nod and write something down in a book and he walked up to the two seeing it was his own two daughters. \"Good morning, Ladies.\" Ian said making both Paris and Nia to quickly stand up. Nia dropped her notebook and school book on the ground afraid to move to pick it up with her father standing there. \"Hi, dad.\" They both said. Ian glanced down at the book giving them silent permission to bend down and pick up the fallen book both looking quiet embarrassed as they did. \"Should you two be in class right now?\" He asked raising an eyebrow. \"I...I forgot to finish my homework last night and Paris was helping me finish.\" Nichelle said her cheeks blushing slightly. \"Besides it's my study hall period.\" \"Well, you know the rules,\" Ian said picking up his youngest daughter's cellphone and slid it in his jacket pocket. \"Since you forgot your homework you will forget that you have a cellphone until the end of the day.\" He watched as Paris looked at him annoyed. \"What's your excuse? Why are you skipping class?\" \"Well,\" Paris said shrugging. \"I wanted to help my sister with her homework. So I thought the world wasn't going to end if I skip one of my classes for the day.\" Paris looked around and saw other students walking the hallway heading to the bathroom stop and begins to talk in hushed whispers while looking at their direction. \"Now dad would you stop talking to us like you do when we're at home. It's already embarrassing to have you as a Principal than to know that you track us everywhere we go.\" Ian frowned as his daughter spoke. He was about to say something else but Paris picked up her school supplies and stormed off leaving Nichelle to stand there alone. \"Don't take it personally.\" She said placing her school books inside her backpack. \"She's a bit upset that Pappou is teasing her about getting married soon.\" Ian turned to look at his youngest daughter and raised an eyebrow. \"I see.\" He said wrapping an arm around her and leading her away from the cafeteria. \"Why don't you head on to the library to finished your homework and I'll have a serious talk with your mom, Paris and you about skipping classes today.\" Nichelle nodded slowly and allowed her father to lead her to the library. Ian stopped at the library door and watched as his youngest daughter walked inside. As he placed his hands in his pockets he couldn't help but chuckle at the fact his youngest daughter managed to collect her cellphone when he walked her to the library. He let it slide that one time. He just knew he needed to talk to her about pick-pocketing a principal. _/_ Day went fast, just after lunch time, Thia Athena passed by the school to pick up her kids and give Nichelle a ride, since both Ian and Paris would stay till late on school for the University Fair. Earlier that day, Toula phoned her husband asking him to send Nichelle to her grandparent´s home and that she would meet with them later. Honestly, little Nia loved to stay at her Greek Grandparents home, Maria spoiled her very much and she loved when Kosta told her stories about Greece, it was fun. This day however. When she got to her grandparent´s home, Maria got confused to see her there and ask immediately, where her parents and sister are. ''today is the University fair at school Yjayja; Mom, Dad and Paris are there. I just decided to come here, because it´s boring, Paris will just pick up a university and come home'' said Nichelle. ''but you should have stayed there, giving support to your sister, after all, we´re family and family need to stay together when making big decisions, right? You don´t want your sister to go to a great university?'' Maria asked and the little girl nodded. ''in fact, I think we all should go. Call your grandfather and I will call your aunts and uncles, telling them to meet us there. Just hope Paris doesn´t come with a decision yet'' ''okay Yjayja!'' Nia exclaimed and rush to call her grandfather. _/_ With that, half an hour later, all the Portokalos family piled up at the school Gym, in order to 'help' Paris chose a nice university to go. In front of the group, Nichelle walked with her head upright, proud for having told all the family about the fair. However, neither her parents, nor her sister, seemed to be proud of her achievements, for as the family approach, both her parents and sister looked at her with angry looks. In the end, after the Greek family almost scared other students away, a very annoyed Paris decided to choose colleges in other states away from Illinois, in order to stay away from her family. ''I knew something like this would happens!'' Kosta complained ''I didn´t told you to found Paris a Greek boyfriend!'' he pointed a finger to her daughter. ''Dad…'' Toula was annoyed ''Mom, Dad, I'm sorry'' Nichelle was a bit ashamed of what she did. ''you don´t need to be sorry Honey, you did nothing wrong'' her dad smiled at her ''just be careful of what you say next time'' he whispered to the girl who smiled. _/_ Later the same night, after dinner and after both girls received the biggest scolding ever, for been skipping class, Paris went to her room in order to get things ready for the other day when she heard a small knock and seconds later, Nichelle appear in her sister´s room, looking ashamed. ''Vicky, sorry for today'' she said ''I didn´t thought Yjayja would like to come see you choose a university'' upon hear that, Paris just laugh ''it´s okay, I know you have good intention, no problem'' ''it´s really that you want to go away? You will let Mom and Dad alone'' the younger girl said and in response, her older sister just smiled ''I'm not like you Nia, I'm kind of don´t want our family pocking their noses around me all the time'' Paris said ''and who said Mom and Dad would be alone? They have you and they have each other… and I´m not going to disappear, I'm just getting out of town for a while'' ''so I'm forgive?'' Nichelle asked with a small smile ''yep!'' the older sister hug her ''sisters always forgive each other'' she said and with that Paris turn the TV and they keep watching movies till late that night, as they always did after dinner.

DSCWin, thanks for helping me fix it, you re great THE ANNIVERSARY It was Ian and Toula's tenth wedding anniversary, and Ian had decided to celebrate the special evening with his wife at a Korean Restaurant in Chicago for a special night. While he planned the dinner for the night, Toula tried to convince the rest of the Portokalos not to throw a huge celebration this year. It was one of the worst things Toula had tried to do since dating Ian. \"What's wrong with Zorbas?\" Toula's mother asked frantically when she heard of their dinner night plans. \"We can close the store down for the night so it would be just you two.\" \"Ma, it's going to be on a Wednesday.\" Toula countered while finishing her clean up for the day. \"Besides, Ian and I don't want a huge family celebration. You guys have done it since we got married. We just want to spend the night by ourselves.\" \"Okay, I won't argue.\" Maria said throwing up her hands in defeat. \"Who's going to watch Paris for you two?\" \"She's going to be stay the night at Ian's parent's. They haven't had time to see her so much and you and dad need a time for yourselves.\" Toula finished washing her hands and hugged her mom before heading out the door.

After all ten's a very lucky number to us Greeks.\" Maria smiled making Toula smile back. _/_ The day was passing more quickly then Toula could comprehend. As she finished getting ready for the night out, Ian surprised her by walking behind her and kissing her gently on her cheek. She giggled and was lead to the car. Ian smiled as he opened the car door. When they arrived at the Korean restaurant, he made her blush like on their first date by pulling out her chair at the table they had reserved. \"Such a gentleman.\" She teased with a slight giggle to her voice. \"Why thank you.\" Ian continued with a smile as he sat down. As they looked over their menu Toula looked up to spot her husband staring dreamily at her. A slightly drunken smile spreading across his face. \"What?\" Toula asked thinking she must have gotten something on her face from when she put makeup on. \"Just admiring on how beautiful you look. Just like the first time I saw you.\" Toula looked confused and Ian chuckled. \"Before I met you, when I looked at other girls that caught my attention they all looked the same. But when I saw you in Zorbas with that coffee mug you were different. You were exactly the girl I wanted.\" \"You wanted a frumpy looking girl?\" Toula asked unsure whether to take his story as a compliment or an insult. \"Yes, because I saw who you were, a Greek goddess.\" Ian gently grabbed his wife's hand and played with her wedding ring he had given her ten years that day. Toula understood then what he had said was all a compliment for her. \"Oh, Ian.\" She chuckled blushing. \"You're such a romantic.\" \"That's good to hear.\" Ian chuckled. \"I practiced that speech for hours at work.\" Toula gave him a slight look but saw when Ian had started to laugh softly it was all a big joke. \"Oh Ian, you're terrible.\" She joked back. Ian chuckled and picked up his water glass and held it up in the air just slightly. Toula followed and waited to see what Ian was planning on doing. \"To my lovely, gorgeous wife, I propose a toast to love you for another ten marvelous years. Thank you for being my companion, my friend and my rock. Happy anniversary.\" \"Happy anniversary.\" Toula said and they gently clinked their glasses together and settled in to enjoy a calm evening alone. The next morning however as Toula settled in to get herself ready to head to Zorbas, there came a knock on the door. Ian answered it and held in a laugh as all of Toula's family showed up bearing gifts as all his in-laws wanted to help keep their celebration alive for one more day. Ian turned to his wife who greeted everyone before laughing as she held on to his shoulder. Ian wished he knew what was to come in a few short years but at that moment he was happy to be celebrating a wonderful ten years with his wife and Greek goddess THE END ","Summary":" Hello ColbiWest, here another story for the Greeks, It's takes place tn yars after the events of th"},{"Movie":"My Big Fat Greek Wedding","Title":"The Apple Side of The Story","Author":"Serpico1986","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12677077","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello.

The silence remain surrounding the silver jeep as Ian drive his parents back to their house after the \"quiet\" dinner at the Portokalos. Sure, Ian himself was smiling from year to ear, as he couldn't wait till finally join Toula in matrimony, after all, the Greek girl is the woman of his dreams. However, he couldn't help but realize, his folks weren't happy with that. Sure, he had to admit, something about the dinner was a little bit awkward, but if love break barriers, his love for Toula and Toula love for him, would put all the awkward on the shame. \"Okay Folks, we're home\" Ian announced as Mr. Miller help his wife out of the car \"you guys enjoyed the night?\" Asked the tall man, but in response, the old couple stood in silence. Once they entered in the quietness of their apparent, Harriet took a breath of relief. \"Oh, silence at last\" she exclaimed \"Are you alright mom?\" Ian asked confused \"Ian, what was that?\" She asked, looking at her son. \"what was what? \" \"Ian, we know you're in love with that girl, she seems a very nice girl, but...

Have a great reading time. Dr. Serpico NEW MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY The hospital's waiting room was packed full of people. They all were waiting for a new addition to their large family. The nurses that were stationed knew who they were. They were the Portokalo family and the new addition was for Paris Miller who sat on her Aunt's lap. She looked very excited to meet her new sibling, as was the rest of the family. It was a crazy day that everyone hoped would pay off well, as Maria had received a phone call from Ian who had to take Toula into the hospital as she went into labor. Ian only had to wait five minutes with a screaming Paris before his in-laws arrived. As Ian went in to be with Toula the rest of the family began to talk about possible names for the new addition. \"Hercules,\" Kosta said snapping. \"It's Greek for Strength, he'd need a strong name.\" \"Nick or Nicolas is a nice name.\" Nick suggested with a wide grin. \"What about Angelo?\" Suggested Aunt Voula, who held Paris who was trying to escape Aunt Voula's grip. \"I think it would suit the family better.\" \"Pappou!\" Paris exclaimed successfully out of her aunt's grip. \"I want a baby sister not a brother. Boys are yucky.\" \"Okay.\" Kosta said scratching his chin thoughtfully. \"But your momma is Greek and Greek women make nice Greek baby boys.\" He smiled at Paris who now looked extremely confused. \"Pappou,\" The little girl started. \"How are babies made?\" Maria quickly shot a dark look at her husband. \"Kosta,\" she said shaking her head. \"You don't say anything to her.\" Kosta frowned knowing she should know about how babies are made but he listened to his wife. \"Thia Voula,\" Paris asked climbing back into her Aunt's lap. \"How do mommies made babies?\" Voula chuckled and kissed her niece's head. \"You're too young to know such things.\" She said with a smile. \"It's messy and gross. Your parents will explain it to you when you're old enough. But I'll tell you what no matter what they have, they will have enough love for you and your baby brother or sister.\" \"That's right.\" Kosta said loudly. \"Because we Greeks have large hearts for lots of love. So you'll love your baby brother.\" _/_ Inside the delivery room, Toula was struggling with the birth of her second child. As she screamed with pain, her husband Ian held her hand in encouragement. As she continued to push she thought back to when her first child, Paris, was born. She remembered she was easy with not a whole lot of fuss, and now she was quite scared something was going to happen. \"We need one more push, Mrs. Miller.\" The doctor said but Toula couldn't hear over her own screaming. \"Babe, you need to push.\" Ian said kissing her head to try and caln her down. In response Toula squeezed Ian's hand nearly breaking the man's hand. \"Ian...\" She gasped trying to summon enough strength to push. \"If something were to happen...please...please take care of them.\" Ian was about to reply when Toula let out one last scream before the delivery room was filled with a high pitched scream of a new born baby. The nurses and doctors worked with measuring, cleaning, having Ian cut the umbilical cord. After the nurses placed a diaper on the newborn they handed the baby to Toula who held the baby to her chest. \"Oh thank god...\" She cried gently stroking the baby's cheek. \"Hello little one.\" Ian said sitting next to Toula and staring at his new baby girl. \"She's beautiful, just like her mother.\" Ian kissed Toula's forehead. \"Thank you.\" Toula said kissing Ian back. \"You better go and tell the rest of the family before they break into the room.\" She gently lifted her new baby up to kiss her gently on the forehead. \"And make sure Paris comes first to meet her new baby sister.\" \"I will.\" Ian said kissing his new baby girl before leaving the room. _/_ Back at the waiting room, the name topic was still going on within the members of the large family, still, when they saw Ian approaching, they stop and Paris rushed to her dad, literally jumping on his lap.

Just by the morning, Toula and Ian woke up with a children chorus on their door, singing some Greek songs. \"That's nice\" Ian pointed out looking through the window \"Its our tradition, my nephews and some neighbors kids sings a few songs\" Toula explained \" come on, let's give them good morning\" they put their robes and went downstairs \"Good morning guys, congratulations, merry Christmas!\" Ian greet them ''Archimedes, you decided to join the group this year?'' Toula congratulated her nephew, who refused to sing last year ''yep… Thieia Toula, you forgot the money'' Archie noticed ''oh, sorry guys wait a minute'' the young woman blushed ''Money?'' Ian asked confused ''we give them money if they sing well'' Toula explain ''well, in this case, I will give them money as well'' Ian agreed. And five minutes later the ten children left the Miller´s house happy as they could be, once receiving ten dollars each. ''you´re awesome Ian'' Toula laughed once the kids got away ''you keep saying this and I'm going to be convinced'' he laugh ''you didn´t need to give them ten dollars, just five dollars was enough'' ''well…'' he think a little ''then I will not give anything to them for the next couple of years and everything will be cool'' he said and the wife laughed _/_ The Christmas lunch and subsequently Dinner took place at Aunt Voula-s house and Toula finally told her family the great news that she was pregnant and everyone celebrate and congratulate the couple ''I can´t wait to see my new grandson and teach him a lot of things'' Kosta smiled ''Dad, we don´t know if it´s going to be boy or girl, but you will be welcome to teach him or hear the importance of Greece'' Toula hug him ''of course will be a boy you´r...'' Kosta stops middle sentence, he was going to say 'you´re Greek' but remember Ian wasn´t ''Anyway, kalá Christoúgenna sweetheart'' ''Sas efcharistó bampá, kai gia esás'' Toula said in Greek ''you don´t have a Christmas tree?'' asked Harriet noticing a huge decorated boat instead of the tree'' ''no, Greek Ortodox have a boat instead of a tree, the boat symbolizes the maritime identity of the country. Greeks, a seafaring nation, of course combined the celebration of Christmas with the sea.'' Explain Nikki ''oh, wonderful'' the old lady smiled ''we do have an small Christmas tree in home'' Toula tried to easy the situation ''you shouldn´t'' Maria scold her '' the last time you hit a pine tree, you got urchin'' she said embarrassing her daughter. On the other hand, Ian made a mental note to get rid of the tree next day. _/_ The party goes on and after the midnight mass, when the family had gotten home to more meal, Nick and Angelo couldn't help but prank Ian, however, when they were about to thrown an egg on the poor non-Greek man, Athena passed in front of him and got hit by the eggs ''Tí simaínei aftó?'' the older sister barked and in response Nick blushed ''Athena, are you okay?'' Toula come for her sister´s aid ''how I can be okay with eggs all over my dress?'' ''you two!'' Aunt Voula asked her son and nephew ''who started?'' ''it´s tradition Theia Voula'' Nick make up an excuse ''and the egg was for you sis'' he pointed to Toula. ''for me?'' she asked confused '' it´s your first Christmas as a married woman'' he said ''nonsense'' Gus interrupt ''there´s no such thing as a tradition to throwing eggs in a newlywed'' ''okay… we admit… ''it was a prank we wanted to catch Ian'' he said and in response Maria slapped him in the head and demand him to apologize to his sisters. And so did Angelo. _/_ The festivities between Christmas and New Year was wonderful and the best part of it was that Toula and Athena ended up forgiving Nick for his ill-fated prank. Meanwhile, to Toula´s surprise, Ian seemed to take all the traditions very seriously and join all kind of celebration her family proposed. He helped the other family members set the fire for the fire pit and proposed that both he and his wife set the right foot inside the house the same time, which results of her tearing up her dress and him falling backyards on the garage. At the night of January first than, the whole family join at Aunt Voula´s house again to exchange gifts and everyone was more than satisfied. When it was Ian´s turn to speak, he first give his wife a tender kiss and took her hand. '' To be honest, I intended to give you this gift on your birthday, but I think this day, our first New Year as husband and wife, deserves something special. '' He said delivering a small box to Toula ' Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, my love'' When she opened the box the woman was speechless, from inside she took out a gold necklace, with two interwoven hearts, with the words 'I Love You Now and Forever' write in Greek. ''wow!'' it was all she could say as every other cousin and aunt, as well as Maria approached to see the gift ''in, this is amazing'' ''I'm glad you liked'' he kissed her in response, but end the kiss quickly, so they could return to the exchange gift thing. And sure, despite of insisting that she didn´t had creativity, Toula give him a Scandinavian sweater, he said he loved. Once the exchange gift and festivities ended, the newlyweds return home and Toula kept her gift well safe, just waiting for the right time to use it that that beautiful piece of love.

And a Special thanks to my colleague and friend DSCWin, who helped me with this story. THE ANNOUNCEMENT It was a deep dark December winter day when 31 year old Toula Miller walked through her new house a smile on her face. The newly wedded woman, who a few weeks ago started getting sick over things she normally would not, found the reason why and he couldn't wait until her husband, Ian, would arrive back home from work to tell him the good news. As expected her family kept ringing her phone begging her to tell them what was happening in her life. But like a good Aunt, her Aunt Voula made everyone stop calling. But a few still continued to call. _/_ Ian Miller arrived home a bit earlier then usual that day. It was the last day of classes until the holidays and he decided to give his student a break and rushed home to see his wife. As he walked inside the smell of a fresh baked home cooked meal drifted through the house. He walked into the dining room to see the table set with two sets of their plates they had gotten on their wedding day, silverware glasses, with candles and a new bottle of wine. \"Hi,\" Toula's voice came from behind him making him turn around. \"I hope you're hungry. I'm making an Italian...like lasagna.\" \"Wow,\" Ian said pulling her into a kiss. \"I'm excited to know such an amazing woman.\" He looked her up and down and smiled at the simple black dress she decided to wear. \"Thank you.\" She blushed. \"Today's such a special day. \" When Ian heard that he expected to be bombarded with her entire Greek family. But Toula gently pulled his face back to face her. \"It's just us tonight.\" she smiled and kissed him gently on the lips. The dinner she made was a simple. The lasagna was delicious despite Toula saying it was the first time she made a non-Greek main dish. The salad was Greek and Ian was happy to see her still putting her heritage into the dinner plan. They both laughed and talked about work, their wedding and their families. It was after dessert when Ian decided to ask his wife what they were celebrating. \"So, what are we celebrating?\" He asked and Toula smiled and sat down on his lap. \"Aren't you full of surprises today aren't you?\" He laughed. \"Ian, remember when I told you I wasn't feeling well these last few days?\" Toula asked and Ian nodded silently. \"Well, I went to see a doctor.\" Ian nearly threw her back trying to sit up but Toula gently stroked his face to calm him down. \"A doctor? Is everything alright? Are you still sick?\" \"Babe, calm down. I'm trying to create suspense, okay?\" \"Okay, I'm sorry.\" Ian apologized. \"Anyways, I went to the doctor and we took some tests...\" She stopped and looked into Ian's eyes. Her eyes welled up with tears as she gently took his hand and placed it on her stomach. Ian's face looked down at his wife's stomach then looked up at his wife's eyes. \"Ian...I'm pregnant.\" A smile appeared quickly on Ian's face as he lifted her in the air as he stood up. \"You...really...\" Toula laughed as Ian spun her around. \"We're going to be parents?\" Toula laughed and nodded. \"I'm going to be a dad!\" His wife nodded and squealed with delight and Ian kissed her gently. \"OPA!\" Ian cheered making Toula laugh. Ian looked at her and held her hands. \"Does your family know?\" he asked and Toula shook her head. \"You're the first one to know. They were the ones that convinced me to see a Doctor.\" Ian smiled and pulled her close. \"I'm so happy. My Greek Goddess made me the happiest man in the whole world!\" \"Don't be selfish.\" Toula said hugging him. \"I'm the happiest woman right now as well. I have you at my side.\" She reached up and kissed him gently on the lips. \"Thank you for being my better half.\" They kept holding each other for hours that night. Ian never stopping to kiss her gently and rubbing his hand over her stomach already planning on what is to be expected once their child was to arrive into this world. But before that, they needed to spill the beans to the rest of the family. THE END ","Summary":" Hello!

GREEK LUCK It was just another day of work to the Chicago citizens and at Greek Town things aren´t different. Well, just a bit, as newly married Toula Miller closed the restaurant earlier to rush back home. That morning, her husband Ian Miller wasn't feeling alright, his stomach was hurting and he had called the school, asking them to find a substitute teacher, so he could spend the whole day in bed. When she got home, she found him in the kitchen, having a glass of water, she approached him, give him a hug and helped him limp toward the couch. ''hey, how are you feeling?'' she asked, kissing his cheeks ''like if Zeus had shot all his bolts at me'' he said, making her chuckle ''I'm not good at all, my stomach still hurts, I just throw up and I´m feeling nauseous every time I try to eat something'' ''okay…'' she reach her hand and touch his forehead, he was warmer than normal ''you´re feverish, we better go to the hospital'' Toula said, trying to sounds calm, despite of her heart start to beating faster ''no babe, no need to…'' ''well, no discussion, you´re not feeling well Ian, so I'm taking you to the hospital'' she said helping him get up ''the man is the head but the woman is the neck'' she whispered to herself, but loud enough to Ian heard and chuckle. As they were making their way toward the car, they came face to face with Nikki, who was jogging around the block. No need to say the woman was surprised to see the scene in front of her. ''Hey Toula. Mr. Pottery Class, are you feeling alright?'' she asked ''feeling like a crap'' he answered annoyed and the cousin´s face fall ''Nikki, I'm taking him to the hospital, can you tell my parents what´s going on'' Toula asked and without other word, helped Ian into the car and drive away. _/_ The miller couple doesn´t took long to reach the Chicago Hospital. Ian´s condition was worsened a bit, he had thrown up in the car, he was shivering from head to toe and almost fallen on the ground upon leaving the vehicle. ''I swear'' he gasped when been wheeled into the hospital ''if I survive, I will eat at least the lamb´s leg in the next barbecue'' he said holding Toula´s hand but the wife didn´t laugh ''ah, shut up'' she said annoyed, but kissed his forehead even so. _/_ For the next half an hour, Ian gone through a list of exams. The Portokalos had arrived at the hospital as well and tried to calm Toula down at the waiting room, when the doctor responsible, Dr. Agatha Salinkária approached with some news ''Mrs. Fortoula Miller? I´m the doctor responsible for your husband´s case'' she said ''yes, how is my husband?'' ''Mr. Miller had an appendix crises'' Dr. Salinkária explain ''we did all tests possible and send him to the OR as he need to have the appendix removed surgically'' ''Oh God!'' Touls covered her mouth with her hands, trying not to cry ''Don´t worry Mrs. Miller, it´s a simple surgery and Mr. Miller had been brought to hospital in time, he will need to spend at least two days at the hospital, but he might be home by the weekend'' the old doctor explain ''wait a minute… Salinkária; are you Greek?'' asked Kosta and the doctor liked at him confuse ''Kosta, it´s isn´t time'' scolded Maria ''yes… Sir? I born in Crete, bur live in Chicago since 1985'' she said ''what a relief… see Toula, your husband is going to be fine, Greeks are the best surgeons ever'' ''well, thanks for the confidence, Sir… I need to come back to my patient'' she said and walk away, once she was out of sight, Toula looked amazed to her dad ''Dad, what was that?'' ''oh, don´t thank me, your husband have the luck of the Greeks… don´t tell him that, but it was luck for him to came into this family, he can pay the debt with his life.'' He said and Toula shocked her head annoyed and worry. _/_ Despite of been a simple surgery, it took at least two hours to Dr. Salinkária come back into the waiting room. Toula almost jumped out of her chair as fear griped her mind, but breathed in relief upon seen the doctor´s face. ''the surgery was a success'' she said '' Mr. Miller is at the Post-OP room, he may woke up in an hour or two'' ''Thanks Havens'' Toula embraced her mother relieved ''can I see him?'' ''of course Mrs. Miller… come with me'' she said as everyone got up ''I'm sorry, but just Mrs. Miller…'' ''oh nonsense, we´re all family'' aunt Voula said followng Toula toward the room. _/_ Ian was getting back into his senses when the family entered the room, he was still very sore and tired but smiled when seen the smile on his wife´s face. ''hey… my personal Greek statue'' he said quietly as Toula kissed him ''how are you feeling sweetheart?'' she asked ''i´ve been better'' ''good answer bud, I would have kill you if you let my big sis alone'' Nick point a finger to his brother in law and in response, Ian give him a middle finger, making him shut up. ''Ian, you should consider yourself lucky. And you should know it´s thanks to a Greek that you´re alive'' Kosta told him ''Dad…'' Toula looked a bit shocked ''if you had married any other no-Greek woman, you would be dead, because your wife wouldn´t bring you to the hospital and if the doctor wasn´t Greek, you would be dead twice'' ''okay Dad, you said'' Toula replies ''could stop been exaggerated?'' ''exaggerated? You got sick because you don´t eat meet'' Aunt Voula snapped ''but don´t worry, when you get better, I will make you a lamb soup'' ''thank you very much guys'' Ian couldn´t help but laugh despite of the pain ''but i´m feeling really tired right now, so I will appreciate if you guys leave me just with my wife'' he said ''alright, that´s alright'' Maria replies ''we´re glad you´re alive Ian'' she said, splitting on him, then she hugged her daughter and told her she was going to come back later to bring her some clothes ''don´t worry, I tell Rodney and Harry what happened to you'' Kosta pointed a finger to them.

Mike has also passed by and told Toula that she should thank him her and Ian were now married. Once he walk away, Toula lied down the bed next to her husband and hugged him tight, but gentle enough to not hurt him and kissed him. ''how are you feeling sweetheart?'' she asked caressing his chest ''i´m feeling a bit painful and tired, but I will be fine… at least is what the doctor said'' he replies and Toula nodded ''you really me scared today Ian'' ''i´m sorry babe, I promise it wouldn´t happen again'' ''well, technically it will never happen again, unless you have two appendices'' she said making him laugh ''but yeah, I just don´t want to see you like this ever again… I don´t know that I would do if I lose you'' ''me neither, thanks for save me… more then you thought'' he said kissing the top of her head as they sleep a somewhat peaceful sleep. _/_ Meanwhile, as promised Kosta and Maria drove half Chicago to Rodney and Harriet's house, in order to tell them Ian was at the hospital, but fine, thanks to a Greek. ''Kosta, please, don't give any Greek speech'' Maria advised him ''you don´t need problem, none of us need it'' she said ''yeah, yeah!'' the older man sputtered annoyed and ring the bell. A minute later, Mrs. Miller opened the door dressed like she was going to a party. ''Kosta, Maria, how are you?'' she greet them politely '' we are almost out, need something?'' ''I hope you and your husband already knew everything, Ian is at the hospital, my daughter took him there because he wasn´t feeling well, he undergo surgery, but now he´s alright'' the Greek man said ''surgery?'' Mr. Miller asked seriously ''what does he had?'' ''his appendix, burst'' Maria said 'but don´t worry, my daughter took him to the hospital in time and she´s with him now'' ''oh…'' Harriet said a bit embarrassed ''glad Toula took him to the hospital'' ''let´s go there as well'' Kosta said urgently ''we came to take you there'' ''well…'' Mr. Miller started '' we had been invited to dinner and we can't miss, so we'll go there, explain what happened and rush to the hospital'' Upon hearing that, Kosta opened his mouth to say something, but Maria interrupted him and pulled him to the car. Once there, the old Greek man grumbled annoyed something he realized. ''this family is really dry as toast Maria, I told you, their son is at the hospital and there are going to a dinner'' ''ah Kosta, stop this!'' Maria scold him ''lucky to Ian who married a Greek woman, we Greeks are really better in everything, especially in been family'' he said starting the car as Maria shocked her head annoyed. THE END.

I can say much more, since the summary already did that, so i wish you a great reading time and a good evening. Have fun Dr. Serpico. RAINING SATURDAY Rain on a Saturday in Chicago could ruin any city resident's day and by the heavy rain that poured on the streets it most likely had as not a lot of people were out, which was a huge disappointment as for the week earlier was warm and sunny the sudden downpour was a complete heartbreak. For the two older Greeks who ran the Greek restaurant Zorbas, they sensed winter was on its way to blanket Chicago in cold and misery. Inside Zorba´s, Kosta and Maria Portakalos sat in a booth looking around their empty restaurant and sighed heavily. It was rare for them to have hardly any patrons to their well-known Greek business so they started doing their books and making a list of supplies that they needed to run their business. For Kosta, it was good that the restaurant was empty he had been feeling depressed that his mood was caused by a cold that was brought on by the cold weather, as they sat watching the rain pound on the glass. \"Achoo!\" Kosta coughed out as, he sneezed closing his eyes in pain as his sinus pressure throbbed inside his head. \"Why didn't you stay home, Gus!\" Maria complained handing her husband a few tissues for his nose. \"You heard the doctor. You have a cold and you should have stayed in bed.\" \"You couldn't run the restaurant by yourself.\" \"I wouldn't be by myself.\" Maria stated as the soft clinks from the kitchen as their son Nick worked in the kitchen cleaning the few dishes that were used throughout the day. \"Achoo!\" Kosta said again covering his face with one of the tissues that Maria had given him. \"I hate the rain.\" He muttered blowing his nose quickly before tossing the used tissue in the wastebasket that sat next to them for that reason. Maria looked at her husband, slumped her shoulders and while staring out the window let out a mournful sigh. \"What's the matter, Maria?\" \"Nothing,\" Maria said shaking her head. \"Nothing at all.\" Gus gave his wife a stern look and Maria sighed again. \"I always get depressed when it rains this hard.\" \"Everyone gets depressed when it rains hard. But us Greeks seemed to get very depressed. Because when it rain this, back in the day, Greeks weren't allowed to even fish. The only good that comes from this rain is water for the plants.\" Maria nodded knowingly. As the clinks from the kitchen stopped their son Nick walked out drying his hands off from a towel and hanging up his apron next to the kitchen door. \"Heading out ma,\" he said walking over and kissing her gently on the forehead. \"I'll be back in an hour. Or unless you start getting customers give me a call.\" \"Will do Nick.\" Maria grinned kissing her son on the cheek. She watched as her only son grabbed his large jacket and walked out of the restaurant and into the rain. \"My, he's gotten a lot braver since he was a child.\" She said smiling her eyes sparkling at distant memories flooding into her mind. \"What do you mean?\" Gus asked wiping his nose with another tissue. \"Nick always loved this kind of weather.\" \"Don't you remember?\" She asked her eyes now full of curiosity. \"Don't you remember back when he was ten? We had that major storm that knocked out the power for half the night and he cried for several hours?\" Gus shook his head slowly and after sneezing into a tissue looked at his wife. \"Not that was Athena and Toula who cried. Nick slept through it like his ancestor Alexander the Great.\" Maria sighed and shook her head. She knew better then to argue with her husband when it came to his great ancestor. \"You're right, Kosta.\" Maria smiled gently patting his hand. \"You're always right.\" \"Of course I'm right.\" Gus beamed before letting another sneeze blow into a tissue. \"I'm Greek!\" Maria and Gus chuckled for a bit before a loud crash of thunder shook the tiny building. \"What do you think that means?\" Maria asked not wanting to let her husband know she was a little frightened with the storm. \"I believe that Zeus is furious with something that we're not doing.\" Gus said seeing a flash of lightning fly across the sky. \"But don't worry, Maria.\" Gus smiled as he could see the fear flashing in his wife's eyes. \"He won't bother us.\" \"You know what I think?\" Maria asked and Gus nodded wiping his nose with yet another tissue. \"I think it's him letting those we lost to cry for us. I mean we have lost so much in these last couple of years that our loved ones are now returning our tears, watering the earth so that new life can begin. That way we can see their beauty everywhere around us.\" Gus looked at the table as he wife finished speaking. He didn't want to say anything because to him, everything made sense to him. But after sitting in the quiet building for another few minutes Gus looked up and said very calmly. \"You know, I believe you're right.\" With that his wife smiled brightly and warmly. ''but I still thik Paris should have come this weekend to help us out, what is she doing at the college anyway?'' he asked and the wife just shook her head annoyed. _/_ In Northwestern, Paris has spent the whole morning in front of the computer and her cellphone, in fact, it has just passed lunch time and she hadn't left her dormitory. When she was little, she remembered that she loved those kind of days, sometimes, when it was really cold, her parents let her skip school and while Ian gone work, Paris and her mother stay in home, doing mother daughter stuff. It was one of the things she missed the most, when starting rain. With an annoyed sigh, she looked toward the window and was still pouring, making her regret deciding not going home this weekend. She thought about her father, Ian was probably alone at home, just with Patches for a company, or at least, had invited Mike or Nick to watch the games. She looked sadly at the picture of her parents at the nightstand and took another sad sigh, if her mother was alive, she would probably be in NYU right now and at home, her parents would probably been watching TV, or her mom would be cooking something, while her dad would be working, no not working, Ian´s habit of bring work to home was new, so they would be probably enjoying themselvs. Whatever the case, the pouring rain wasn't improving her mood in any way, so she decided to call her dad, to ask him something, when suddenly, the door opened and her friend Beth come in, with an umbrella and a beg. '' if it keeps raining like that, Chicago will stay underwater'' she complained ''it admires me how you had the courage to go out, I forgot my jacket at home and I'm freezing'' Paris stated ''hey, there´s a bit of Spanakopita at the fridge'' ''thanks. Paris, are you okay?'' she asked a bit worried ''yeah!'' the other girl smiled ''I'm just a bit worry, my aunt said my grandfather is having a bit of cold, so I got worry'' ''oh, Poor Mr. Portokalos, I hope he got better soon'' Beth patted her shoulder, but when Paris keep staring back at the phone, Beth sit beside her friend ''what is bothering you? It´s Clark again?'' she teased ''what? No! I don´t want to hear about him ever again'' Paris exclaimed ''actually I was thinking about my mom, I miss her, especially when it´s rain'' ''oh…'' Elizabeth didn´t knew what to say ''you never did actually told me what have happened between you and Clark'' the other girl said trying to change the subject and in response Paris started to tell. Everything had happened during the Autumn break, when Paris get home for a week of resting with her family, she got a messenger from Clark, saying he wanted to broke up, once he was in love with someone else, who by the way he was cheating Paris with. ''oh God! Paris, I'm so sorry'' Beth said ''yeah, well, water under the bridge, as my mom would say. It was hard however to convince Uncle Nick to not punch him on the face'' ''it would be well deserved'' the friend agree ''hey, let's go down to the cafeteria and have a cup of tea?'' ''great idea'' Paris agreed and go to the bathroom to change her cloths. The best thing of a raining day, Paris conclude, was to have some company to share your thoughts and what makes her sad that day was to know her dad has no one to share the wet day with.[Chapter 2] Before we sart, i must say something, not necessary linked to this story, its thhat i realised something, not just in Fanfiction, but at the movies as well. The surname Portokalo, just apply to Maria, Kosta and Nick, the rest of the characters, have different surnames, like Toula is Toula Miller, Athena have probably took her husband´s surname and Aunt Voula and Angelo, have Mr. Takki´s surname (Nikki is married, so she have another surname as well) anyway, it was just a tought i have, this way i created a Greek surname to Aunt Voula and Takki. Hope you liked and DSCWin, thanks for help me fix it last chapter Dr. Serpico RAINING SUNDAY Sunday dawned raining harder than the previous day, which caused Patches to be grumpier as ever, once he couldn´t have his daily walk with his owner. Sure, Ian tried to take him outside, the previous day for a while, just to get back home all wet. Unlike Saturday, Sunday morning Ian had what to do, like any other Sunday, he joined the family at the church despite of the rain. And when he got back, the 2-year old Bassett Hound was already there waiting for him for a walk. In vain. After eating something for lunch, Ian sit on the couch and stared at the rain drops rolling down the window, harder that it was falling yesterday. For some reason, that weekend he felt loneliness than any other day and he doesn´t know exactly why, after all it has been two years since Toula had passed and it wasn´t the first time Paris decided to stay at Northwestern for the weekend, so he was a bit used to have just the dog for company, still this time, he felt different. Maybe, he thought, he had been too harsh with Paris on that argument about responsibility they had last month and he was feeling guilty for yelling at her. Or maybe he was just getting old. Again, Patches started to walk up and down inside the house, looking for what to do and stopping in front of his owner with that sad look, waiting for Ian to do something, but he didn't ''sorry Patches, we can´t go out like this'' he said and the dog just lie down on his feet. ''sorry bud'' he said. Honestly, Ian thought, maybe he wasn´t that used of been alone, he still missed his wife very much and every time he thought about her, or what they could have been done if she was alive, he felt like he was going to break down all over again. ''hello Love!'' e smiled to a photograph of his wife ''it´s weird watch the rain from up here? I miss you'' he said kissing the picture and walk toward his bedroom. The rain fall for the rest of the afternoon non-stop. Patches seemed to give up wanting to go out as he lied down at Ian´s bed and slept during the whole time while his owner cleaned the house and performed some fixes here and there. Once he finished, he lied down on the couch with a beer and watch some homemade movies, after that he called Paris in order to wish her a good week and in response the teen promised to go home next weekend, since that one was almost the death of her. ''don´t say that honey, I bet you have a lot of fun away from you old man here'' he teased her ''we missed you this weekend Paris, your aunts and grandparents asked a lot about you… and your dog also missed you'' ''I missed everyone, especially Patches too. Good night Dad, see you Friday'' she said hanging off Once finishing talking, he head to is bed, before lied down, he looked at the empty side of it, trying to picture Toula sleeping beside him, in vain, Patches suddenly jump back on the bed, spoiling the nostalgic moment, this way, Ian just patted the dog's head, picked up his book and read till sleep. _/_ Takki Àtychos closed the door, when finally the last guest left the house. From the kitchen, he heard his wife sigh, looking relieved. ''what a day!'' she complained. As much Voula and Takki loved to be around Maria and Kosta, once thy are their family as well, the old Átychos couple, also wanted sometimes to be around just their children and grandchildren. And what just happened that day. After the church, Nikki, her husband and children, plus Angelo and Patrick joined Voula and Takki for lunch and spend the whole day in their house. Sure, they had called Kosta, Maria and the rest of the family for the lunch, but for the first time, just Athena and her husband showed up. Kosta was still a bit sick, so he and Maria preferred to stay at home; Ian was busy doing the schedule for the up come science fair and Nick and his family were out of town for the day. ''you tell me!'' Takki wrapped his arms around her and give her a kiss ''I was thinking, maybe we should go to Maria´s house, see how Gus is doing'' Voula suggested ''Voula, you called them two hours ago, they said their fine, it was just a sinus infection, Gus said'' ''a sinus infection can turn to something worse.

This way, i hope you like this one and stay tuned for the next chapter. see you around. TILL DEATH DO US APART – Part 1 Paris Victoria Miller was just 2-years old when her parents had their first and only big fight, however, since she was just a toddler, it was guaranteed that she doesn´t remember at all what happened. Sure, as a married couple, Ian and Toula had their disagreement and more than once during the eighteen years of their marriage, Ian has found himself sometimes sleeping on the couch, even so, before dawn the next morning, they ended up make peace and became happily married all over again before breakfast. However this time, things had worked out a bit different, it was the worst fight they ever did, or so, it what Aunt Voula had told her later on. FLASHBACK It has started during the reception party at Nick´s wedding, everyone was dancing, cheering and celebrating. There´s also new faces around, since a few members of the family who lived in Greece, decided to come and visit them. One of them, was cousin Ariana Dracolis a beautiful woman, worthy of a magazine cover, but with principles worthy of an alligator. When the elders of the family heard of her arrival, they were quick to warn the young men about the vile temperament of the Greek woman. However, Toula, being one of the youngest and now a new mother, did not believe in the story she was told, after all, she had only seen her cousin once in her life and did not believe she could be a bad person. _/_ The party has started and since at that time Ian was still the only Non-Greek member of the family, besides his daughter, everyone wanted to talk to him, about stuff. At first, Toula was the one who got uncomfortable with that, but seen him acting so natural around her family, warmed her heart and she let him busy with male conversations, while she keep busy with other things, like watch Paris. As the party goes on, Toula started to noticed something strange, sure, almost all the time, her husband stays with her and their daughter, but from time to time, he goes talk with other people, however, twice that time, she noticed him talk with Ariana, who every now and then would bump into Ian and laugh, every time he said something. A pity though, was Toula being away to hear what was being said, since if she had heard, that weekend would not have existed. But sometimes, albeit erroneously, an image would be worth much more than a thousand words. _/_ The party was over and Toula got silently all the way back home and despite of Ian asking if she was okay, she didn´t answer, preferring to ignore him and focus in the uncomfortable sensation inside her chest. Once at home and with Paris already sleep, they decided to talk more seriously, which rarely happened between they too. This way, when they prepared to go to bed, he placed both hands on her shoulder and asked what was happening. ''I'm the one who ask what happening Ian?'' she asked and h looked at her confused ''what you mean?'' he asked ''You and Ariana were making fun with each other.'' ''we are… wait, what?'' Ian was amazed ''Toula, what you talking about, nothing was going on, that woman is crazy'' ''Ian…'' Toula was having a mixture of angriness and sadness in her voice ''I never heard you say such thing about someone of my family…'' that comment however, made the tall man angry ''Fortoula'' he used her full name ''If you have the patience to let me explain, I'll tell you that ...'' ''I don´t think I want to hear explanations now Ian Leopold'' she said knowing he doesn´t liked to be called by his middle name '' Just get out of here and leave me alone.'' Toula said, lying down the bed, not wanting to look at her husband. Ian was speechless, he wanted to explain to his wife what had happened, but he knew somehow she was hurting right now, so he just grab the keys and drive away for the night. _/_ Next day by the morning, Toula woke up with a cry coming from Paris room, indicating that the little girl was already woke up. Out of habit and thinking that all the events from last night was just a nightmare, she reached out her hand to touch her husband, just to find out his side of the bed empty and cold. With a gasp, she jump out of the bed and rush downstairs first, in order to know if Ian was sleeping on the couch, once she find him absent, she ran back to her daughter´s room, forcing herself not to crying as she feared she had made herself and Ian ruined their own marriage.[Chapter 2] The story isn´t finished yet, there will be a third chapter, but i prefered to keep all the climax in one chapter. With that, i say, thanks God its a fanfiction and diferent of real liffe, as Hazel Grace, from the movie ''Fault In Our Stars'' would say '' I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories. On the one hand, you can sugarcoat it the way they do in movies and romance novels, where beautiful people learn beautiful lessons, where nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song...'' TILL DEATH DO US APART – Part 2 (Continue with the Flashback !) ''YOU WHAT?'' Aunt Voula exclaimed shocked. That morning, after a rush breakfast, Toula ran to Aunt Voula, in order to tell her what happened, the 32-year old woman was confused and embarrassed and on top of it, she doesn't want to involve her parents into the mess, afraid of what could happens next and afraid of what Maria and Kosta could think of her. Oh Disgrace! ''but you saw them kissing?'' Aunt Voula asked ''What? No!'' Toula gasped \"well ... at least, not while I was looking, Ariana was flirting with my husband and he was probably liking it, because whenever he said something, she would laugh'' Toula said and both her uncle and aunt shook their heads. ''that house-destroyer '' Aunt Voula swore '' and it was not for lack and warning, for we warned, didn´t we Taki?'' ''we did'' Uncle Taki nodded ''we did warn everyone, even Nikki to be careful with Ariana, she has a fetish for men.'' The old woman said ''I asked my husband to leave, so he got the car and went '' Toula tried to hold a cry ''and if he went to see her... and if they… Oh God! You think I'm better getting a divorce? And what about Paris…'' ''what? Divorce?'' Aunt Voula hold her niece's face in her hands '' Greeks do not divorce and we don´t have lovers for that matter, all that antics that happened in ancient Greece were finally changed in 1920 and we now we respect our partners'' ''but I didn´t married a Greek!'' Toula pointed sadly '' your husband has become Greek to marry you, he is now as Greek as you and your uncle, so do not worry, we'll figure this out, and you and your husband will be fine again by dinner time'' the aunt said and turn to her husband ''Taki, go find Ian and bring him here, tell him that he and his wife needs to talk'' ''and if is he with her?'' ''than we call the Italians and ask them help us give them a good spanking'' Aunt Voula said ''now, now my darling, nothing is going to happen'' said the woman hugging her niece ''just one thing Thia, don´t tell Ma and Dad about this, please'' Toula asked and Voula just nodded _/_ Meanwhile, at Zorba´s, Maria was giving some help at the kitchen, since Nick was on honeymoon, Kosta needed to go talk with some investors alone and Maria had to work double at the restaurant. By later morning then, Mike come to visit everyone, with a funny expression on his face. Upon seen him there, Maria hurriedly came to greet him and offered a coffee, which he turn down. ''no, thanks, I already had one. Maria… may I ask, it's something happened with Toula and Paris?'' he asked ''I hope not, why?'' asked the concerned old woman ''they isn´t here?'' he asked ''Mike, it´s Saturday morning, my they are probably at home right now'' ''well, that's the problem…'' Mike was a bit embarrassed to start ''Ian appear at my house yesterday around 11PM, asking if he could sleep in the couch, so he drank all my beers and passed out'' he explain ''what? Wait a minute…'' Maria got worried, so she pick up the phone and called Toula´s house, but no one answered ''Mike, he told you something?'' ''just that he needed a place to stay for the night'' said the other man ''i didn´t asked why'' he said as Nikki appear at the restaurant ''Nikki, thanks God you´re here, you heard from Toula?'' ''I saw her going to Ma´s house this morning with Paris. Why?'' asked the cousin ''never mind, I need to go there, Mike, can you come with me?'' asked the mother as they left the restaurant _/_ Back at Voula and Taki´s, Toula had managed to calm down and was playing playing in the floor with Paris, while waiting to her uncle get back with her husband, when the front door opened and Maria appeared following by Mike. When she saw her mother coming, the young woman paled ''Toula, what´s happening? Why you send Ian to his friend´s house?'' she asked and once Toula finished telling her mother the same story she told Aunt Voula and when she finished, Maria jumped on her feet, furious ''I'm going to call your father, I'm going to call the Italians and beat up Ian, how dare he ...'' Maria, calm down you too, we´re not going to call any Italian, or even Gus, before we know for sure what happens, I'm sure Ian have a good explanation for what happened, so we better work this out as nice Greek woman'' suggest Voula, when Taki appear ''I didn´t find Ian anywhere'' said the old man ''he´s at Mike´s house'' said Maria ''let´s go pick him up'' Mike offered, before anyone say something and bioth he and Taki left again. _/_ It took two hours for Mr. Taki and Mike come back with Ian. In the meantime, Maria called Kosta and told him to wait at the restaurant, while she was solving some woman´s business. When they appeared with Ian, who was a bit nauseous due his hangover, so Voula and Maria, get Paris to another room and left husband and wife alone to talk. ''you have a black eye'' she said quietly '' Your uncle said that this black eye is on the alert, because I was very stupid yesterday'' Ian answered and Toula first impulse was to thrown herself in his arms and kissed him passionately, but she doesn't, since she wanted to be strong now, to prepared herself for what she was supposed to her. ''Ian, what happened yesterday… really happened?'' she asked ''you want to know?'' Ian asked and Toula nodded '' 'Your cousin actually flirted with me during the party, telling me how much I could be a good lover ... or other low-level things'' Ian started '' and no matter how I told her, I was not that kind of person and that I was not going to change my family for nothing in this world, she continued to insinuate myself'' he said '' I do not think she thought I was your husband, or if she found out she was too drunk to remember'' Toua stood in silence for a few seconds, before saying something. ''Thia Voula said Ariana is a home-wrecked, she warn us about her fetish for men '' I had told Mike, the day I met you, that I thought all women were equal on both the physical and emotional sides. When I met you and we started to leave, I discovered how amazing you are, I told you, I came to life after I met you, you and Paris are my life now and I would be very dumb, if I left you, or let someone else dissect it all'' he said and Toula just keep staring at him '' we swore an oath when we married, that nothing and no one would be between us, only death could separate us and I intend to fulfill my promise of oath. But ... even after that, if you want me to go, I'll understand, that´s why I left last night'' ''Ian…'' it was Toula time to talk '' I want you to know, that I was very hurt by what I saw yesterday, I did not expect you to give confidence to another woman, so I think I was really jealous, seeing my cousin flirting with you. Still, I trust you, if what you're saying is true, that Ariana tried to flirt with you and you tried to stop her, I believe in you.'' She said ''still, I think, till everything get complete clean between us, I think it´s better if we sleep separately… or be away from each other for today'' ''okay'' Ian nodded ''I want you to come back home Ian, you can come back, I just don´t want to talk to you much till we listen Ariana´s side of the story, please, we can… we need to do this'' she said and Ian nodded again, wanting nothing more than make peace with his wife once and for all. _/_ It took a day and a half to Uncle Taki, Angelo and Mike find Ariana and bring her to Taki´s house, where both Ian and Toula, as well as Maria, Voula and baby Paris were waiting. The other night, Ian has indeed get back home, but as part of the deal, he slept at the couch. When Ariana arrived, Toula didn´t waste time and as soon she faced her cousin, she asked if she really had flirt with Ian. Once asked then, Ariana confirmed Ian´s version of the fact and though she confesses she's drunk at the time of flirting, she still calls Ian sissy, because he does not accept her assaults. ''well, if that's the case, I'm a jerk with pride then, because I will not leave my wife, because of a shameless girl'' Ian said ''Ariana, if it´s better if you get back to Greece you know?'' said Maria ''you caused enough trouble for now'' ''oh, don´t worry, I'm going, be happy, enjoy yourselves. Bye Thia Voula and Theo Taki, it was a pleasure see you two'' she said and walk away. Once Ariana gone, everyone stood in silence for a second, Toula seemed relieve and Ian acted like a huge rock has been taken away from his shoulders. He look at his wife, but doesn´t say anything. ''well, i will check on Paris, then I will have some tea'' Maria said suddenly ''come with me, Voula?'' ''Of course. Taki, you and Angelo could please go to the dry cleaning store?'' she commanded and they go away, followed by Mike. ''Toula…'' Ian decided to say first ''you forgive me?'' he said and out of the blue, the woman jumped on his lap, almost sending both of them to the floor ''I do, I do, of course I do, sorry for sending you away, I was so angry…'' '' '' I know ... and I promise I will not give you reason to be angry again. I love you'' ''I love you too Ian, Promise you will never leave my side?'' ''I promise, you and Paris are my reason for been alive'' he said ''now let´s go pick up our little girl and go home… believe or not, I'm starving!'' he said, making her laugh. With everything settled, they never left each other side ever again. Sure, as a married couple, they had always a few disagreements, such as where Paris should study, or if they should have a pet or not. But fight like that one never happened again and they stood together, intill … (End of Flashback.)[Chapter 3] I hope you two enjoy the last chapter, despite of been a bit boring in my taste. Thank you TILL DEATH DO US PART – Part 3 (Present Day) After a pleasant dream turning into a nightmare, 17-year old Paris woke up with a start and look at the clock, it was still 2AM. It has been two days since her mother had passed and a day since her funeral and still, it seemed like everything was a nightmare. Unable to sleep, the teen get up and head to the kitchen, in order to have a glass of water. Passing by the living room, she found her father sleeping on the couch, as Ian refused to sleep on his own bed that night, without his wife by his side. There were still some flowers and cards scattered across the dining table, which they had not yet had the patience or the will to put out. Some family members said they would come back to help clean up the next day and maybe it would be better that way. Carefully to not wake her tired father, Paris pick up some cards and got back to her room in order to read them. Most of the cards were from people from school, not only her classmates, but also Ian´s colleague workers, people who knew her mother and now wished the family strength to face the difficult time. One of the cards however, belongs to a woman she never heard about, Ariana, it has coming from Greece, it was writing in Greek, but the woman in question seemed actually happy to see her father as a widower, oe single, as she describe in the card. In shock, the teen decided it was better to tell someone what happened, so, next morning, around (AM, she rushed to Aunt Voula´s house, in order to know what was happening. Sure, her first thought was ran to her grandparents, but changed her mind, as she doesn´t want to disturb the old Portokalos. _/_ At her house, the old woman was having breakfast with her husband, when her grandniece arrived, pale and confused. ''Paris Dear, what happened?'' asked the old woman scared and as Paris told her about the card. Voula seat her on the couch and told her everything about her Parents only and big fight ''I can´t believe she had the nerve to write this!'' Aunt Voula exclaimed rereading the note ''she´s Dad´s lover?'' Paris widened her eyes in shock ''of course not!'' Thia Voula exclaimed, but lowered her voice again ''how many time I have to repeat? Greeks don´t have lovers'' ''Dad´s isn´t Greek'' Paris was unconvinced ''he had to became Greek to merry your mother, he´s Greek by baptism and Greek at ant instance'' ''Sorry Aunt Voula, this is very confused'' the girl was about to cry, so the old woman hold her in her arms ''My dear, confusing things are being left behind '' she said '' it happened a long time, that I doubt his father still remember the incident. And the important thing, that you should know, is that your parents loved each other so much that they were not destroyed by evildoing'' ''Pappou and Yjayja know about this? About this cousin'' ''just Yjayja, I and Theos Taki knows what happened, it was a secret with your parents'' she said and the girl nodded ''and if this woman come back?'' she started to hyperventilating ''we need to protect Dad from her…'' ''Paris, stop this nonsense, your dad doesn´t need protection, because he´s not in danger and he´s old enough to protect himself. Besides, I doubt Ariana wanted to come to America again. And if she does, your uncle and me, we still have contact with the Italians.'' The old woman try to laugh '' Now, wipe those tears away, your family is here to protect you, but I suggest we forget this subject.'' ''you think Dad should know about the card?'' ''no, your father is suffering enough now, as I said, let´s forget this subject and keep our head straight to the future, huh?'' With the agreement of doesn´t touch the 'Cousin' Subject anymore, or even tell Ian about it, Paris got back home and get rid of the card, before her father or anyone else could find it. However, inside, couldn't help but smile bit, happy for at least, her parents to be happy in the eighteen years they are together. _/_ Around 12PM, Ian finally got up, with the smell of something been cooked at the kitchen. His eyes were red and he was feeling like the whole earth was on his shoulder, but still, he decided to get up and face it, once he knew Paris needed him more than ever right now. At the kitchen meanwhile, Paris was making a few pancakes, when she saw the man approaching and siting on his usual spot at the dinner table, liking like he had aged two years overnight. ''Hey Dad'' Paris greeted him, trying to smile ''how you feeling?'' ''Remember that TV Show you watched, there was always someone trying to ripping another character heart and crush it in million times?'' ''Once Upon A Time? Yeah, why?'' ''I'm feeling like that, like someone had ripped my heart out of my chest and crush it'' Ian replies and in response, Paris just hugged him ''I'm feeling like this too'' Paris nodded ''Dad…'' for a second, the girl thought of asking her father if he really loved her mom, but jut upon looking on his eyes, Paris got all the answers needed ''I think Mom must be proud of you'' ''hum?'' Ian looked confused at his daughter ''I don´t know why I said that, I just wanted to cheer you up'' she said as both father and daughter stayed there, hugging each other, remembering the last days they spend with the woman they loved most. In secret, Paris was happy, God knows what would have happened if they had got a divorce, so she was happy they managed to figure out how to be happy again and live eighteen years of pure joy and love… with a few disagreements here and there, till death do they part.

The "},{"Movie":"Bloomington","Title":"Bloomington - A new beginning","Author":"StanaK","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10266260","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Bloomington As I watched her walk off the campus from my office window, I wanted to cry. Not because I had lost my job, or because I wouldn't be working as a teacher anymore, but because she was gone. I opened the window and watched her for another second, walking away from me and us and from all the memories and all the future we could have had. \"Wait! Jackie! Wait!\" She turned around and looked back to me. She knew it was me calling for her. \"Wait!\" I ran out of my office, down the stairs and straight up to her. \"Don't go. Jackie, please don't go! Don't leave me like this.\" I almost started crying. \"Catherine.\" \"I am sorry. I am so sorry for saying you are not worth it. I don't care about all the other people, as long as I can be with you. You are worth it, and you are different. You are so different and so worth it.\" I could hardly get air and I noticed all the students and teachers as well as a camera team staring at us. \"I am so sorry.\" She stepped up to me and I almost thought she would slap me, but she smiled and reached out for my neck to pull me closer. \"I never wanted to leave you.\", she said and kissed me. Mumbling started everywhere around us as I gave in and let her hug me and I just couldn't stand it anymore, all these rumors and all the hiding I had to do for years. \"Yes, I slept with her. We slept with each other! And I am not a freaking vampire!\" I shouted it out as if it would have eaten me up from the inside. Jackie laughed and just by then we realized the camera team was still filming us. And the pose we had been in was obvious enough to show that we were more than teacher and student. \"Shit.\" I said and Jackie laughed even more. \"What? Don't you want to do something against it?\" And she took my hand and kissed me. \"No. I don't want to do anything against anything. I just want to get back to your house.\" \"Catherine, are you ready? Our flight leaves in less than 2 hours!\" I was about to freak out. I never trusted anyone. Never. And now I agreed to be moving to LA with Jackie. \"Uhm… yeah, I will be down in a second, honey!\" But she knew me better and knocked at the door. \"Can I come in?\" She asked and when I nodded she opened her arms so I could slip into a hug. \"What's up Catherine?\" It felt like drowning. \"I am not so sure if it's a good thing we are doing… I mean you are outed because of me and I am… older than you. Way older.\" Jackie looked up to me, and she seemed really happy. \"I am outed, we are outed, and I don't care. Just like that, I don't care anymore, Babe. And if I would have cared about the age gap between us, we wouldn't even have come together.\" \"Together?\" I asked. \"Yeah, like we would have never started our relationship.\" \"We are not in a relationship.\" She laughed. \"Babe, you are moving to LA with me. Like together. You know that, don't you?\" And there, for the first time, I felt so stupid keeping all my fences up in front of Jackie, who was always honest and caring. \"I know.\" I let my forehead sink against hers and took a deep breath. \"I am scared.\" \"Scared of what?\" \"That everyone is going to hate me. And that they will try to tear us apart. And remember when I picked you up from that family thing of yours? Your mom looked at us in such an angry way. I am older and a woman…\" \"So? I don't care about what my mom thinks, I just care about you.\" \"And all the fans?\" \"What about them?\" She asked so innocently that I couldn't believe it. \"Well, what if they are going to hate us?\" \"Babe, they are just fans. They don't like me, just my work.\" She stroked over my backbone and suddenly I was so calm about everything. I just knew she was the right one. I looked out of the airplane window and couldn't help but notice that there were many, and I mean many, fans of Jackie's waiting in the arrival hall. \"Oh shit.\" I said and leaned back into my first class seat. \"You are kidding me, right?\" Unfortunately I knew she wasn't and that it wasn't her fault either. Jackie picked out her phone. \"Wade, where the hell do all these people know from that we are coming to LA today?\" I could hear him answer: \"Sweetie, you were all over the newspapers during the last days. It's no wonder that people know.\" \"Shit, are we at least being picked up?\" \"You didn't want me to organize that for you, remember?\" She hung up. \"Shit. Shit. SHIT!\" She grabbed her bag. \"Please tell me you grabbed sun glasses.\" I nodded and picked them out of my bag. \"Great. Listen, just keep walking and don't let my hand go, okay?\" Again I nodded. \"Jackie!\" \"Jackie! Here!\" \"Can we talk to you?\" People, everywhere, just people, no matter where I tried to step or look, there were people all around and the only thing that kept me from falling or collapsing was Jackie, right in front of me, holding my hand as tight as possible. \"No. Please, peeps, just let us get through. We are really tired and just want to get out of the airport.\" \"Please talk to us!\" \"Since when are you together with your professor?\" \"How long did you two date before it became public?\" \"Isn't an age gap of 10 years a little much?\" I pressed my lips together and held my back as close to me as possible, hoping we would be reaching the exit soon. \"Miss Stark! Do you feel what you did with Jackie was right?\" I tried to ignore them, just kept walking, but my luggage got stuck somewhere and I had to stop to get it out. \"Miss Stark! Miss Stark! Tell us, how does it feel to lose your job for sleeping with a student?\" They made me angry, but I needed to behave, at least for Jackie. I grabbed my luggage and tried to keep walking. Jackie turned around. \"Babe, come on, we need to get out of here.\" I could barely see her through my sunglasses. I nodded and followed her. \"Miss Stark! How could you creep on your student? How could you actually feel well with this? Getting turned on by innocent children! You are unbelievable!\" Jackie stopped and I knew by the way she was breathing that she would get onto that woman who had just talked to me like that. \"Jacks, no. Stop.\" I walked up to her and touched her arm. \"Sweetie, please don't. Wade will kill you…\" \"Faggot!\" And Jackie exploded right into that woman's face. \"Faggot?! You just called us faggots? And you called my fiancée a creep? Seriously look at you! Do you think you are something better? Fuck you! Fuck you and all the other ignorant people!\" She wanted to hit her, but I grabbed her arm and she rather focused on me. She grabbed my neck and kissed me. In front of all these people, homophobic or not. It wasn't one of the kisses we normally shared, it was hard and rough and filled with so much anger. \"Let's go.\" She said and grabbed my hand. \"I just want to get away from these fucking retarded people.\" We exited the airport and Jackie got us a taxi. \"Uhm… Jackie?\" She was checking her phone and I could see her scroll through the newest headlines about us. \"Yeah?\" I cleared my throat. \"Did you… did you just call me your fiancée?\" I asked and looked out of the window, so she couldn't see how nervous that made me. LA was beautiful and ugly in the same time. \"Oh…\" She looked up to me. \"I am sorry… but I wanted to just make her shut up.\" I took a deep breath. \"So… it wasn't meant?\" I must have sounded pretty disappointed. \"Why?\" She asked. \"Well… just like that. Curiosity.\" She put her phone down. \"Babe, would you even say yes if I had asked you?\" \"I… I don't know… probably?\" \"This morning, you didn't even want to admit that we are in a relationship and now, you want to marry me?\" She moved closer to me and smiled. \"I like that. Quick steps forward.\" Suddenly I felt so stupid and turned away from Jackie. She reached for my hand and made me look at her. \"You really would marry me?\" She asked and because I didn't want to hide behind my fences anymore, I nodded. \"I am the 'go big or go home' kind of girl.\" I put a piece of her hair behind her ear and she laughed. \"So now, that you finally admitted our relationship and stuff, you go for the whole?\" I nodded. \"Wow. I am 24 and I am going to get married.\" The grin over my face couldn't have been wider. \"So… yes? Like, we are going to get married?\" \"Yes. I guess, but I am not happy with the way this happened yet, so I need to think of a more romantic way to ask you again…\" I grabbed her and kissed her with all my love. I started with her mouth, then kissed a line down her neck and back up to her ear. \"Babe… you know that we are now kind of famous, yeah?\" \"Mmh…\" She grabbed my leg and moaned. \"Just saying… we are in a taxi…\" \"Oh.\" I sat back up and tried to cool myself down. \"Sorry.\" She laughed. \"Not there for. Wait until we arrive home.\" \"Mother.\" \"Jacqueline.\" \"This is my fiancée Catherine Stark. Catherine this is my mother.\" \"Nice to meet you Mrs. Mahoni.\" I offered my hand for a shake but the woman in front of me didn't seem to be too interested in me. \"Jacqueline, now drop the charade. I know you are just doing this because you want to make me angry. And marriage is definitely not an option with a person like her.\" Bam. Right into my face, I guess I never experienced so much hate in one place. Jacky laughed. \"No, mother, really not. Not the whole world spins around you. I am in love and I think I am old enough to know what I want. And I really want to marry Cat.\" Did she just call me Cat? \"Whatever. This person is not going to sit by the same table as your family does.\" \"Don't worry mother. We are just going to leave. Catherine is my family now.\" Jacky reached for my hand and intertwined our fingers. \"I love her.\" She said while looking right into my eyes. I smiled and bend down a little so I could quickly kiss her. \"And I fell for your daughter. I am sorry if I am not what you expected her to have in her life, but I am not that bad of a person.\" I got myself back together and built my fence back up, so this person couldn't hurt me. \"Whatever.\" She turned around and walked away from us. \"If you ever change your mind Jacqueline, you know how to reach me.\" \"I am sorry.\" We were back in the taxi and finally on our way to Hollywood, where we would be living from now on. Jacky bought a house for us there. \"You don't have to be.\" She looked out of the window and she had moved away from me as far as possible. \"Sweetie, please, I can go back to Bloomington, if you want…\" She looked at me. \"I don't want you to go away. I just don't understand why my mother never understands me.\" I saw a tear running down her cheek. \"Oh, honey.\" I moved towards her and pulled her into a hug. \"I am so sorry.\" ","Summary":" Bloomington As I watched her walk off the campus from my office window, I wanted to cry.

J'ai tenté d'imaginer ce que pensait Catherine quand elle a soufflé ses bougies et qu'elle a fait son vœu. J'espère que ça vous plaira, bonne lecture ! JK/CS Catherine se trouvait devant son gâteau d'anniversaire, gentiment acheté par Jackie pour elle, cela faisait des années que personne n'avait pensé à son anniversaire au point d'apporter un gâteau. Les autres amantes qu'elle avait eu avant elle, ne restant jamais assez longtemps pour se souvenir de la date, ou alors pas assez longtemps pour l'apprendre, mais Jackie était différente en tout point. Elle avait réussie à s'insinuer dans son cœur, sans même qu'elle ne s'en rende compte, se réveillant un matin à ses côtés en se demandant comment elle avait fait pour vivre jusqu'à maintenant sans elle et le bonheur qu'elle lui apportait. Jetant un regard à la jeune femme à ses côtés, Catherine ne put empêcher un tendre sourire de prendre place sur ses lèvres, avant de refixer le gâteau et les bougies se trouvant dessus. Cette année elle savait exactement quel serait son vœu avant de souffler sur les bougies, elle voulait passer le reste de sa vie avec sa petite actrice aux doux sourire, elle voulait pouvoir se réveiller tous les matins et que la première chose qu'elle puisse voir est le visage endormit de l'étudiante. Avançant son visage un peu plus proche du gâteau, la Professeure de Psychologie Anormale laissa son sourire s'agrandir encore plus un court instant, avant de souffler les petits tubes de cires, éteignant les flammes s'y trouvant...

Bloomington is not mine, and no profit is made from this work. Dialogue is taken directly from the movie. Jackie has never done this before. She's never sought out anyone's mouth, waiting for a kiss. She's never had someone looming over her, their body touching hers in all the right places. She lied, just now, when she said she had. Although Catherine seems to like her innocence, Jackie doesn't want to put her off with inexperience. But Catherine's skin is warm against hers, sending sparks down her body and into her mind. And so, when she speaks, the wrong words slip out: \"What should I do now?\" \"What do you want to do?\" The edge of desire is still in Catherine's voice, calming Jackie's burst of fear. She still wants you. Everyone has a first time, and it looks like hers is going to be better than most. She isn't as worried when she says, \"I don't know.\" It helps that the room is dark. She can barely see Catherine's face, and so can interpret each expression as she chooses. The small smile that flashes over Catherine's face erases the last of her fear, as does the next question. \"Are you scared?\" A breath. \"Don't be.\" Showing she isn't, Jackie kisses her.

Bloomington is not mine, and no profit is made from this work. The best thing about the start to a new term is finding a new target. Catherine enjoys her game as much as she enjoys teaching. And she truly does like teaching — or rather, imparting knowledge to those select few students who actually care. Her classes are always well attended; she has a reputation for more than one reason. She is a good professor, beyond whatever else is claimed of her. She's heard the rumors, and welcomes them. But the real fun is searching her students for a new girl, one who will welcome her advances. There's always one or two in a class, and the signs are always the same. The coy glances over a propped up textbook, dressing more nicely as the weeks go by, lingering after class or dropping by her office. After a chance encounter, she sees the start of those signs in Jackie Kirk. The star. The girl who looks way too innocent for her own good. Catherine longs to know if she actually is that innocent, or if she's just playing a role of how she thinks a proper college girl should act. At the department mixer, Catherine catches Jackie staring at her. Several times. Jackie even makes an attempt to come up to her, but aborts it when someone else reaches Catherine first. Then she disappears, hiding what Catherine's sure is a look of disappointment. That's when Catherine knows it's time to move in for the kill, and the start to a new game.

Je pense que je ne suis pas la seule qui n'est pas aimée la fin de Bloomington, sérieusement, ils auraient pu nous faire un épilogue qui les montre dans un ou deux ans ensemble, ça aurait été bien, et j'aurais préférée. Alors pendant que je râlais sur la fin sur Twitter, j'ai laissé échapper un tweet qui m'a donné cette idée, j'espère que ça vous plaira, bonne lecture ! JK/CS POV Catherine : Son avion était dans trois heures, je le savais parce que je m'étais renseignée, souhaitant être au courant du moment où elle s'éloignerait de moi, du moment où une partie de moi-même me serait arrachée pour partir à l'autre bout du pays. Elle avait mon cœur depuis le début, j'avais essayé de le nier, de faire comme si il se trouvait encore dans ma poitrine, mais cela n'avait servi à rien, il était sien depuis l'instant où j'avais croisé son regard dans le bureau d'Hecht. Essuyant une larme solitaire qui venait d'échapper traitreusement à mon œil gauche, je soupirais, il ne restait que deux heures et cinquante-neuf minutes cette fois-ci… Parce que oui, au dernière nouvelle le temps s'écoulait bien entendu et je ne pouvais rien y faire, tout ce que je pouvais faire était de regarder les secondes, puis les minutes s'écouler, m'éloignant toujours un peu plus d'elle, de son sourire qui faisait pétiller ses yeux bleu, de sa douceur d'être qui me touchait, me rendant meilleure. Parce que c'était le cas, elle avait cassé mon armure, jour après jour, sans même s'en rendre compte, elle avait révélée celle qui sommeillait au fond de moi et maintenant, maintenant que je m'étais totalement ouverte à elle, elle me laissais seule et désarmée, elle s'en allait, me quittant, c'était tellement injuste… Retenant un sanglot, je sentis la tête d'Ethan se poser sur mes genoux, me faisant sourire malgré mes larmes, voilà au moins quelqu'un qui ne m'abandonnait pas, mon fidèle compagnon, le seul homme qu'il y aurait jamais dans cette maison… Un aboiement plaintif retentit alors, tandis qu'un nouveau soupir quittait mes lèvres, lui aussi c'était beaucoup attaché à Jackie. - Je sais Ethan… Elle me manque déjà aussi… Elle allait partir, dans un maudit avion, décidément ses maudites machines volantes avaient tendance à me prendre toutes les personnes que j'aimais d'une manière ou d'une autre… J'aimerais tellement pouvoir faire quelque chose pour changer cela cette-fois ci, mais je ne pouvais rien y faire pas vrai ? Elle ne voulait plus de moi, elle m'avait quitté, je lui avais fait du mal, lui avait balancé des horreurs à la figure, tout comme elle l'avait fait avec moi… Je ne pouvais pas juste lui demander pardon et espérer que ça allait passer, ce n'était pas possible, ça, ça n'arriverais que dans les films… Quoi que ? Regardant l'heure, je vis qu'il restait seulement deux heures et cinquante minutes avant que son avion décolle, j'étais resté 9 minutes entières dans mes pensées. L'aéroport était seulement à trente minutes d'ici, j'avais le temps de la rejoindre, de lui dire ce que je n'avais pas réussi à lui révéler quand elle était éveillée, je devais le lui dire, ou je ne savais pas si j'aurais un jour la chance de le faire. Je ne pouvais pas la laisser partir sans qu'elle le sache, tant pis si elle me rejetait, au moins elle saurait, au moins j'aurais fait les choses bien, je n'aurais pas à passer mes soirées à me demander si tout cela aurait été différent si je lui avais tout avoué. Ayant un nouveau regain d'énergie, je me levais rapidement de mon canapé après avoir repoussé gentiment Ethan. Je courrais dans les escaliers, il fallait que je me change, le pyjama que je n'avais pas quitté depuis ce matin au réveil, n'était pas la meilleure tenue à mettre pour me rendre dans un aéroport, même un aussi petit que celui de la ville d'à côté. Attrapant le premier pull que je trouvais qui se trouva en être un noir, ainsi que le premier slim gris de mon armoire, je me changeais le plus rapidement possible, j'avais rendez-vous avec mon destin, je ne pouvais pas me permettre d'arriver en retard. Je sais que tout cela sonnait un peu dramatique, mais c'était ce que je ressentais, mon avenir allait se jouer dans l'heure, si elle m'aimait aussi, si elle se sentait prête à ce qu'il y est un nous, je n'hésiterais pas un seul instant à prendre Ethan et la suivre à Los Angeles, je pourrais mettre cette maison en location, ou la garder pour les vacances, je déciderais de cela plus tard, si elle acceptait qu'il y est un nous. Attrapant un gilet gris qui trainait sur le bord de mon lit, je le passais rapidement, avant de quitter la chambre, attrapant la première paire de chaussure que je trouvais, des ballerines noir, super cela serait bien plus pratique qu'une paire de haut talon si je devais courir pour la trouver. - Je reviens vite Ethan, je vais la retrouver, souhaite moi bonne chance ! Voilà maintenant que je me mettais à parler à voix haute à mon chien en espérant qu'il me réponde, c'était tellement stupide, secouant la tête, je fermais la porte à clé derrière moi, déverrouillant ma voiture d'un clic sur la clé de la voiture, courant jusqu'à celle-ci mon cœur battant à la chamade dans ma poitrine… JK/CS POV Jackie : Encore deux heures et vingt-cinq minutes et je quitterais cette ville, cet endroit où j'avais muris autant en une année que j'aurais pu le faire en plusieurs, ou j'avais appris à aimer aussi, à l'aimer elle, devrais-je dire. Catherine Stark, elle avait été mon première amour et j'aurais aimé qu'elle soit le dernier, je ne savais pas si je pourrais à nouveau aimer quelqu'un comme je l'aime elle, j'aimais tout chez elle, de son sourire à fossettes, à cet air sérieux qu'elle prenait quand elle parlait de sa passion pour la psychologie anormale. Il n'y avait que quand j'étais dans ses bras que je me sentais complète, que je me sentais bien, malheureusement elle ne ressentait pas la même chose avec moi, elle ne m'aimait pas comme je le faisais, elle me l'avait dit elle-même… Sentant une larme couler sur ma joue, je l'essuyais rageusement, fermant les yeux un instant pour essayer de me calmer, je ne pouvais pas me permettre d'éclater en sanglot en plein milieu d'un aéroport où l'on pourrait me prendre en photo, je voyais déjà les gros titres \"Jackie Kirk fond en larme en plein milieu de l'aéroport, la pression de son retour médiatique trop dure à supporter pour elle ?\". Ouvrant les yeux une fois sûre d'être capable de retenir le flot de larmes, je retins un hoquet de surprise en voyant qui se trouvait devant moi, la personne que je rêvais le plus de voir, mais que je ne pensais jamais trouver devant moi, Catherine Stark. - Hey Porc-Épic, souffla-t-elle, prenant place à mes côtés, tandis qu'elle se mordait nerveusement la lèvre inférieure, petit tic que j'avais déjà repéré chez elle quand elle était stressée. - Catherine, que fais-tu ici ? - J'avais besoin de te parler, je ne pouvais pas te laisser partir comme ça… - Co… - Attends, laisse-moi parler, me coupa-t-elle, posant sa main un court instant sur ma jambe, avant de la retirer, comme si elle c'était brûlée , s'il te plait, sans me couper, parce que je ne suis pas sûr de pouvoir tout te dire si tu m'interromps… Tu ne peux pas savoir comme je prends sur moi rien que pour être ici, à tes côtés, pour ne pas prendre mes jambes à mon cou et rentrer chez moi… Lui répondant d'un simple hochement de tête, j'attrapais sa main, je sentais qu'elle était stressée et je voulais lui montrer que j'étais là pour elle. Mon cœur battant à la chamade, je la vis fermer les yeux un court instant, inspirer une grande quantité d'air, avant qu'elle ne l'expire, rouvrant les yeux, les plantant dans les miens… - J'étais assise toute seule sur mon canapé, en faites j'ai passé ma journée assise dessus, à compter le nombre d'heures, de minutes et de secondes qu'il restait avant qu'un maudit avion emmène quelqu'un encore loin de moi, pas de la même manière je le sais bien, mais c'est tout comme, et c'est là que j'ai réalisé quelque chose, je n'étais pas obligée de te perdre, je pouvais te retrouver, ce n'était pas comme avec mes parents, même si cet avion t'emmène loin de moi, il ne t'enlève pas à moi, loin de la… J'avais envie de parler, de lui dire que je l'aimais, qu'elle n'aurait jamais à me perdre comme elle avait perdu ses deux parents, mais je savais qu'elle n'avait pas fini de parler et qu'elle ne me croirais pas, après tout, un accident d'avion était vite arrivé et ce n'était pas moi qui pourrais l'empêcher, malgré mon brevet de pilotage, alors je me tus, resserrant juste ma prise sur sa main, lui montrant ainsi que je comprenais ce qu'elle voulait dire, l'incitant à continuer. - Quand tu m'as annoncé que ton agent à Los Angeles t'avais appelé, que l'on te voulait pour reprendre ton rôle de Tyler dans un film sur Neptune 26, j'ai eu peur, j'ai compris à ton regard qui pétillait que je ne pourrais jamais t'empêcher de faire, ça, parce que c'est ce que tu aimes, tout comme j'aime la psychologie anormale, alors j'ai commencé à essayer de m'éloigner de toi, en étant odieuse, la pire des garces… Je t'ai mentis quand j'ai dit que je ne pensais pas que je tenais assez à toi pour que nous ayons une relation, parce que ce n'est pas vrai… Tu as capturé mon cœur depuis l'instant où j'ai croisé ton regard dans le bureau de Hecht, j'ai essayé de te faire croire que tu n'étais qu'une étudiante parmi tant d'autre, mais la vérité est que tu as toujours été différente, parce que …, je sentis sa prise sur ma main s'intensifier, mon cœur s'emballant encore plus qu'avant si c'était possible , j'allais finir par faire une attaque si elle faisait durer le suspense plus que cela , parce que je t'aime Jacqueline Kirk, et je crois que je pourrais en mourir si nous devions nous séparer, si nous devions ne plus jamais nous revoir… Je ne l'avais pas laissé continuer, au diable les possibles paparazzis qui pouvait se trouver dans l'aéroport, au diable les apprentis photographes qui pourrait nous prendre en photo avec leurs téléphones, je plongeais sur les lèvres de Catherine, l'embrassant comme si c'était la dernière fois, essayant de lui montrer ainsi tous mes sentiments. - Je t'aime aussi, j'ai voulu te le dire un million de fois, mais je ne pensais pas que c'était réciproque… Lâchant sa main, je passais mes bras autour de sa taille, l'attirant à moi, tandis que je sentais des larmes, de joie cette fois-ci, remplir mes yeux, elle m'aimait, je ne la perdrais pas, elle m'aimait comme je l'aimais et elle était venu ici, pour moi, pour me le dire, pour me dire qu'elle m'aimait moi… Je voulais me pincer, me faire mal quelque part pour voir si je n'étais pas en train de rêver, si tout ceci n'était pas le fruit de mon imagination… - Dis-le moi encore, soufflais-je alors au creux de son oreille, fermant les yeux quand je l'entendis me répondre de la même manière. - Je t'aime… - Encore… - Je t'aime…, répéta-t-elle une nouvelle fois, et je suis prête à te le dire encore et encore et encore, jusqu'à ce que tu n'en puisses plus de me l'entendre dire… - Ca c'est impossible, répondis-je en me séparant d'elle, je ne pourrais jamais me lasser de ça… Posant un baiser sur ses deux fossettes, je vis son sourire s'agrandir et un léger rire, sortir d'entre ses lèvres, tandis que je remettais ensuite une mèche de ses cheveux derrière son oreille. - Je vais venir à LA, me dit-elle alors subitement, ayant recommencée à se mordre la lèvre inférieur, très certainement stressée de ce que j'allais lui dire , je vais me trouver un appartement, et venir te retrouver, laisse-moi juste un peu de temps pour m'organiser… - Catherine, tu n'es pas obligée de faire ça. Ce que j'avais dit tiens toujours, je pourrais venir te rendre visite ici, le week-end, dès que j'en ai l'occasion… - Je sais, mais j'en ai envie, on gardera ma maison pour quand tu auras des vacances, pour venir se ressourcer, mais je ne veux pas vivre si loin de toi, avait-elle rétorqué, son regard brillant de larme, ce qui me fit acquiescer rapidement, je ne voulais pas qu'elle soit triste, je voulais la voir heureuse et si me rejoindre à LA, affronter la tempête médiatique de ses prochaines semaines avec moi lui faisait plaisir, très bien, de toute façon j'aurais beau mentir, je voulais qu'elle soit à Los Angeles avec moi, je voulais pouvoir la voir autant de fois que je le pouvais, pas juste un week-end sur trois. - Ok. - Ok ? - Oui, mais il est hors de question que tu te cherches un appartement pour toi seule, je me suis dégotée un petit appartement pas loin des studios, je veux que tu viennes y habiter avec moi, avec Ethan bien entendu. - Vraiment ? Tu ne penses pas que c'est trop tôt ? - Catherine, nous avons plus ou moins été ensemble pendant toute l'année, crois-moi, je suis sûr. - Dans ce cas, d'accord, sourit la jolie blonde en face de moi, ce qui me fit sourire à mon tour. - Super ! Jetant un coup d'œil à ma montre, je vis qu'il me restait une heure avant de devoir embarquer, soupirant je fis ma plus belle moue de chiot battu avant de lui demander , tu me prendrais dans tes bras jusqu'à ce que je sois obligée d'embarquer ? - Bien sûr Porc-Épic, tu n'as même pas besoin de me le demander. Ouvrant ses bras en grand, elle me laissa m'y glisser avant de les refermer sur ma taille, pour mon plus grand bonheur. Moi, qui il y a encore une demi-heure, ne pensait plus la revoir, l'avait dans mes bras, que j'aimais cette femme, elle et son courage que je n'avais pas eu… JK/CS Et voilà, j'espère que ça vous a plu, je ne suis pas super satisfaite de la fin, mais je ne savais pas comment le finir sinon, alors j'ai laissé ça comme cela. Je publierais peut-être d'autres OS de temps en temps, parce que ça m'arrive souvent d'en écrire, mais pour l'instant, je vais me concentrer sur l'écriture du chapitre 2 de \"Secret And Love\"!

Not of all time but damn near. And what sucks, is that not that many people have seen or heard about it. I mean, even when you google search it you have to specifically search for the FILM, otherwise it will direct you to the location. I don't see it doing that with the movie RED and the colour red, nor the movie Harry Potter and the Harry Potter books. It's like, wtf man? More people need to watch this movie. Especially, since the two main characters are hot as fuck, and have so much chemistry. Plus, the writing for it was pretty good. Not that I'm surprised. I mainly watched it though, the first time anyways, because of Allison Mcatee. I mean, come on. That's woman is beautiful. And those dimples? To die for. Anyways, I'm talking to much. Hope you enjoy the story. R & R S'il vous plait. Merci. Stark's POV: It's happening again. The nightmares. They've happened every night since she left. Time and Time again I think about how big of a mistake I made by letting Jackie walk out of my life. It would've taken 3 words to make her stay. And time and time again, I regret telling her that she wasn't worth it. I shouldn't have said it, but...once she talked about my parents...I couldn't take it. And that day she asked me if I hated her...I wanted to cry. I could never hate her. I told her she was different, and I meant it. She was the only one I loved. These are my thoughts every morning after I wake up screaming. I just sit there, in tears, thinking about...HER...And how much she's NOT missing me. I'm sure she's moved on. I wouldn't know. I haven't been keeping up with any news about her. I didn't even see Neptune 26, like I told her I would. It would've been to painful. I didn't get any magazines, or newspapers, just in case she was in them. I didn't want to read about her having a boyfriend or girlfriend. Or possibly...getting married. Or pregnant. It would break my heart to find out that she was engaged or having a baby with someone other than me. I sigh and let my head fall back against my pillow, the colder temperature relaxing me. I look over to my left at my alarm clock: 5:30 a.m. Why did I agree to do an early class? I get up and move to my apartment window, pulling the scarlet curtains aside. My breath catches in my throat. The sight gets me everytime. I made sure, that when I moved here, I got an apartment overlooking the city. After I finished up that year at Bloomington, I moved to California to teach at UC Berkeley. They offered me the head of the psychology department position. I couldn't resist. Besides, the events and rumours, with and about Jackie wouldn't follow me to California. So, I sold my parents house and Ethan and I moved out here. I guess I'm kinda lucky to have not been offered a job at UCLA, knowing that Jackie is currently living in L.A...Okay, so maybe I just looked up where she lived. Which is not creepy! I just wanted to see if she was still in California. Valid reason. Anyways, I knew that there would always be a chance that I might run into her if I lived and taught there. But here? I doubt she'd come here. Not with such a great college right there. I can only hope. It's been 2 years. 2 years since I last saw her. 2 years since the last time I was intimate with anybody. After her well... no one was attractive to me. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of beautiful girls and handsome guys in my classes but, no one can compare to her. They couldn't get me going like she could. I flirted though. Oh yes, I flirted. But I couldn't help the feeling of guilt that would appear everytime I tried to think of someone in THAT way. I know that a lot of the students in my class find me attractive but, there's nothing. No sparks, whatsoever. It's like she has control over me, and she's not even here! I feel myself getting angry and frustrated, as I always do, and I know that today is not going to be a good day. Or so I thought. I get ready quickly and drive off towards Berkeley. I stop at a red light, and start lightly drumming my fingers on the wheel to the beat of the song playing on the radio. I hear a car pull up to me and I turn to look and was surprised to see a black BMW. I smiled a little and admired the car. Me, being the curious person I am, drove forward a bit to see who was driving it. My jaw dropped. \"Jackie?!\" You like? Yes? No? Let me know. God I love you. xD Oh, also the point-of-view will often change a lot, especially in the paragraphs since I can't quite decide which point-of-view I like best. Technically it's 1st person, but it's like 1st person past and present tense. Maybe even future tense. Hope that's not too confusing.

This is the first thing I have ever written so constructive criticism is most welcome! Hope you enjoy! To say that Neptune 26 had been a success would be an understatement. Sure, Jacqueline Kirk was considered famous before the film, but she immediately shot up into an entirely new league upon the release. And she loved every second of it. Acting had always been her passion, her security blanket. In front of a camera is where she felt most at home. Other than a certain professor's bed in Bloomington. Three years had passed since the day she walked away from the one thing that made her the happiest. She considered it one of her strongest moments. It took every fiber of her being and then some to prevent her from running back into the arms of the woman who had quickly taken over her heart. What began as sadness and regret morphed into anger and self loathing. Over time, she channeled those emotions and used it as her motivation to succeed in all she did. She wanted to show the older blonde just what she was missing out on. She had gone from a somewhat naïve girl to the now witty and confident woman that she is. But even her passion for her art wasn't enough to keep her mind off of her. She found herself thinking about how things would be like if they had worked through their troubles in Bloomington. Or what would happen if they had stayed together and made their relationship public. But mostly she just wondered how Catherine was doing. If she was being honest with herself, she'd admit that she missed her terribly. Catching her thoughts wandering back to the professor, she quickly shook her head as began making her way back to her trailer. It had been a long day of shooting and a rather emotionally exhausting one at that. She had spent most of the day crying whilst shooting a particular scene. One that she had experienced some years ago. Though it was all an act, she could still feel the sting of Catherine's words when her co-star tells her character that she isn't worth the effort. The blonde rounds up her belongings and takes off to meet with her fellow actress: Hayley Quinn. A tall and slim brunette with eyes so green, they gave the most expensive emerald a run for its money. An actress known for being outspoken. Famous for playing the bad ass characters, and pulling it of. Jackie would proudly admit that she was once attracted to the brunette. Had she not have been so affected by Catherine, she would have pursued something more than friendship with her. But as it turned out, the two preferred to keep things platonic. Since coming out, every woman that Jackie was spotted with was deemed her new lover. Jackie found it entertaining for the most part, occasionally causing a stir by neither denying nor confirming the rumors. Hayley was the current woman under speculation of being Miss Kirk's newest interest. She spots Hayley in the corner of an upscale restaurant hidden away from most of the paparazzi. \"Jacks!\" cries Hayley. The two greet each other with a kiss on each cheek before seating themselves. \"Hey you! I honestly thought I'd never get away from the set.\" Jackie begins as the exhaustion finally sinks in. \"God I'm glad I'm not you. Taking a break from filming is probably one of the best things I've done this year. You should consider it.\" \"Don't tempt me. I'd gladly take a break but Wade would have my ass served as part of a three course meal if I did\" Jackie chuckles at the image. \"Must you say that just as we're about to eat?\" A look of disgust graces Hayley's features briefly before she continues, \"But really. The only reason I invited you out is because I was worried about how you'd be after shooting. Don't think I haven't forgotten what scene they had you working on tonight.\" Jackie smiles. She knew she could always count on Hayley to be there for her without needing to be asked. When they had first met, the blonde knew that Hayley would come to mean a great deal to her. She wasn't wrong. \"It was okay.\" the blonde shrugs, only to receive a look of disbelief. \"Bullshit.\" Jackie can only laugh. She should have known better than to try and lie to her friend. Of all the people she knew in Hollywood, Hayley was one of the few who knew of what Jackie had left before shooting Neptune 26. \"It was shit\" she sighs, \"Every take just felt like I was in that room with her all over again. It didn't get any easier the more we had to do it. But I guess it worked in my favour. I mean, I wasn't acting anymore by the time we hit the fourth or fifth take. Wade said something about never seeing something so genuine before\" she attempts to sound nonchalant. \"Sweetie..\" Hayley reaches for the young blonde's hand. \"I'll be fine. I promise. It's been three years. I'm no longer the train wreck I was back then.\" she replies and she squeezes the brunette's hand, looking at her sincerely. The moment was interrupted as the waiter announced his presence. Soon after, their orders were taken and they fall into a comfortable silence. Jackie can feel Hayley staring at her with questioning eyes but decides to ignore it for the time being, choosing to stare out of window and watch the people outside going about their business. Before long, she senses the other woman's internal debate and decides to put her out of her misery. \"You'd think that after all this time you wouldn't have to think before telling or asking me something. Out with it\" Jackie teases. She earns a poke in the arm. \"It's nothing. I just wonder how someone could be stupid enough to do what that bi-\" \"Hayley.\" the blonde warns. \"..Woman did to you.\" \"I'd rather not think about it. I've moved on.\" a pause, \"But sometimes I still.. I don't know.\" she lets out a frustrated sigh. \"You still what?\" \"I just.. I want to show her that I know how to be okay without her. I want her to know what she's missed out on. I want to know that she didn't fair any better than I did when I left. I want her.. to just get out of my head.\" Her voice rising as steadily as her frustration. She feels Hayley's hands on hers again. \"I know it's hard sweetie. I could tell you that you'll be okay and you'll be over it soon but that'd be a lie. You don't move on from something or someone who had that sort of effect on you in a matter of two seconds.\" Jackie can see the pity in the brunette's eyes. \"You know what I want?\" Hayley asks. \"What's that?\" \"For you to be happy. Just have a day without her bringing you down.\" Hayley states with a small smile, her thumb gently caressing the back of Jackie's hand. \"Thanks Hayls\" Jackie returns the smile, \"And you wonder why everyone thinks we're dating\" as she glances at their hands. Hayley throws her head back with laughter before bring their hands to her lips, placing a soft kiss on Jackie's knuckles. \"Let them think that.\" She replies with a wriggle of her eyebrows. The two continue to laugh and talk as they enjoy their meal. Conversations ranging from work, to plans for the next day, to silly subjects. Jackie feels the emotional baggage of the day dissipate. This is exactly what she needed. Halfway through the meal, Jackie excuses herself to use the restroom. Getting up, she doesn't make it far before she hears her counterpart. \"Don't fall in the toilet, honey!\" Hayley yells from their table, effectively garnering a few inquisitive glances from those around her. In the process of turning around to give the brunette a stern look, Jackie fails notice that one of the patrons had begun to rise from their seat. No more than a second and a collision later, she finds herself reaching for the closest thing to break her fall. Managing to grab hold of a chair, she apologizes profusely to the poor being she had almost trampled over. \"Oh my God, I am so sorry! I should have been looking where I was going! I do this all the time! I'm sorry!\" She cries as she bends over to pick up the other person's belongings. Soon after gathering various items that had fallen out of the other woman's purse, Jackie straightens up to look at the most recent victim of her clumsiness. The world stops momentarily. \"Catherine?\" I feel like I should mention this. The title is from a song called A Belle to Remember by Hayley Kiyoko.[Chapter 2] Thanks for the reviews on the first chapter! Hopefully you all enjoy this one. I'll tell you now, the start may be a little bit slow, but if you'll bear with me, I'll try and make things as interesting as my imagination will let me! Also, if I owned Bloomington, I wouldn't have to write fanfiction ;) She doesn't think she's ever tried this hard to look like she was having a good time. Wondering why she thought it was a good idea to go to dinner, she attempts to pay attention to the conversation at hand. When it came to meeting new people these days, she just didn't have the patience to see where things could go. She always felt like they would never meet her standards now that she's had the best. This date was no exception. It was clear that this man had nothing better to talk about than himself so she takes this opportunity to dwell upon how far she has come. She never imagined that she'd get away from Bloomington, let alone find herself in California. As luck would have it, she found an appealing career option in L.A. She was weary, yes, but she figured her chances of bumping into a certain blonde was slim. A name that high-profile would be hard to come by in public. In the end, her passion for teaching won out. If she was honest, her hope may have influenced her decision as well. Three years ago, it had gotten to the point where she could no longer stand her own company. With the two things she loved gone, she felt she had no reason to be there anymore. Her career torn away from her, her love walked away from her, though she held herself accountable for both. Come the end of that year, she decided that she needed a change. With her bags packed and a ticket to the first destination she could think of, she said goodbye to Bloomington, with hopes of not returning for a long time. Difficult was one way to describe her escape from the place she once held dear to her. Upon her arrival at the airport, the panic sank in. It dawned on her that to get away, she'd have to get on a plane. What was once fear of flying became a reminder of what she had lost. Or rather, who. A sigh. She recalls berating herself for lingering on the one thing she was determined to forget about. She walked in with new-found confidence as she thinks about how she'll make a change for the better. Her thoughts interrupted by a loud shrill, sounding from her bag. Her date doesn't look pleased at the interruption so without a glance, she rejects the call, hoping she hadn't upset him too much. He carries on about his career success and she can't help the sigh of boredom that escapes. \"Catherine? Are you okay?\" She's pulled out of her thoughts upon realizing she was asked a question. \"Yeah, I'm okay.\" she plasters on a fake smile, but he remains oblivious. \"Are you sure? We can do something else if you prefer?\" she suddenly feels bad when she hears the change of tone. It's not completely his fault that she'd rather be with someone else. Since moving to L.A, she's steered clear from the dating scene. Every time she met someone, she'd push them away, always comparing whoever she was with to Jackie. She eventually decided that she had enough of being lonely. That it was time to give someone a chance. Partly why she's here tonight. \"No really, Lucas, I'm fine.\" she attempts to reassure him. \"Oh, okay.\" he begins, \"It's just that you've been so quiet and I'm getting a bit concerned. Was this date a little too soon?\" Before she can respond, her phone rings again. She glances at the caller ID, thankful for an escape. \"I'm really sorry, I have to get this. I'll be right back.\" she says absent-mindedly and Lucas can only nod as he watches Catherine rise from her seat. In an instant, he's out of his seat and attempting to steady Catherine as a young woman all but rams herself into his date. For a second, the entire scene was an image of tangled limbs with various items flying around haphazardly. He bends down to pick up her phone, as it was the closest thing to him. Straightening up, he notices Catherine freeze whilst the younger woman continues to gather Catherine's belongings. Curiosity gets the better of him and he allows himself to watch the women in front of him. The younger blonde rises and a look of recognition graces his features. It was Jacqueline Kirk, the hottest thing in Hollywood. Before he can say anything to her, he notices the look of surprise on Jackie's face. \"Catherine?\" the younger actress breathes. Catherine remained quiet. Her heart was racing and breathing became one of the most difficult tasks. She questioned the reality of the situation, convinced that she was just in a dream, much like many that she's had over the last few years. A hand on her shoulder pulls her out of her musings and she looks up to see Lucas with questioning eyes. She smiles at him, hoping he took that as her being alright. Her attention is back to the younger blonde. All she can do is stare at the woman who meant the world to her \"Jacqueline.\" She breathes, finally finding her voice. Catherine hopes she sounded a lot more confident than she felt. The two continue to look at each other for what felt like an eternity. For Catherine, the world around her didn't exist anymore. In this moment, it was just her and Jackie back at the house in Bloomington. The world was theirs again. Her head swam as she was overcome with emotions. How she wanted to reach out and touch the face she had missed the most. But their eternity was cut short as a brunette quickly made her way over. \"Sweetie! Oh my God, are you alright?\" the new woman is all over Jackie and Catherine finds it near impossible to not wring her neck then and there. \"You know me, always the clumsy one\" Jackie admits bashfully, causing Catherine's stomach to do somersaults. She barely notices the brunette staring at her in the midst of her admiration for the actress. \"Listen, I'm really sorry about this. It was my fault for distracting her\" The younger brunette apologizes, simultaneously placing her arm protectively around Jackie and maintaining her gaze at Catherine. The older blonde began to feel uncomfortable under her scrutiny. Taking note of the rising tension, Lucas decides to intervene. \"Jacqueline Kirk! And Hayley Quinn! Oh my, fancy seeing you two here!\", Lucas cries in excitement, gaining the attention of all three women. Jackie and Hayley take a moment to acknowledge Lucas' presence, politely shaking his hand and making conversation with him. Something clicks in Catherine's head upon hearing the brunette's name and she feels her heart breaking all over again. Though it's something she'd rather not do, she'd occasionally delve into the happenings of Jackie's personal life. The most recent article she read had mentioned rumors a blossoming relationship between the two women in front her. She so desperately hoped they were just rumors. \"Well, as an apology, choose any bottle of champagne you like. It's on us. We'll be making our way back. Hopefully we didn't interrupt your date too much\" Hayley announces, not taking her eyes off the other blonde, only look away to smile at Lucas and Jackie. She finally turns away, guiding the young actress back to their table, arm still around her. Catherine releases a breath she didn't realize she was holding. She has felt more emotion in the last two minutes that she has in the past three years. Taking a seat, she rests her head in her hands, recounting the events that just transpired. Deciding that she would be much worse company than she already was, she looks up at an expectant Lucas in hopes of cutting the date short. \"Wanna tell me what that was about?\" he questions before she can begin to excuse herself. \"She bumped into me\" Catherine was in no mood to discuss this with Lucas. \"How do you even know Miss Hot Shot Kirk anyway?\" \"She was one of my students back in Bloomington\" Lucas nods, accepting the answer though it was obvious that he didn't completely buy it. Catherine sighs. Her head was starting to pound. Whether it was from the crash or from the sudden onslaught of feelings, she wasn't sure. All she knew was that she needed to go home and compose herself. \"Luke.. I'm really not feeling too well\" it wasn't a complete lie. \"I think that collision did more than what I initially thought\" \"Yeah, it looked pretty bad. Would you like me to take you home?\" he offers \"No it's okay. I can take a cab.\" \"Oh\" he replies, looking dejected \"Well, can we do this again sometime? Properly?\" \"We'll see.\" she states with a small smile, though they both know that it meant no. With that, she grabs her purse and makes her way to the door. It takes everything within her to not find Jackie amongst the other patrons. She just knew that if she did, she wouldn't be able to stop herself from telling her how she felt. She definitely wouldn't be able to fight the urge to kiss her. So while she had the willpower, she wasn't going to stop herself from getting as far away from Jackie as possible. ","Summary":" Hi all!

Still, i want to wish everyone a nice reading time and i hope you enjoy my story. Dr. Serpico CHAPTER 1- DAYS OF OUR LIVES Vacation had started a week ago and yet a lot had happened since then. To a start, 17-year old Paris and her Greek boyfriend had broken up, no one had cheated anyone, they just talked and realize they would ended up better as friends than couple, besides, Bennett, the boyfriend in question and his family was moving to California in September, so it would be hard to continue dating. To tell the truth, the girl don't took the broke up that easy and stayed depressed for a few weeks, not really sure if she had made a good choice, however, it was her favorite Great Aunt Voula, who convince her to forget Bennett and find someone else. After all, she was still in time to find someone to marry. Meanwhile, the teen had another things to worry about; it had been a while, that she realized her father has been acting strange, like he has having some trouble with is eyes. At first, Paris teased him, saying he was getting old and therefore, needed some glasses. Still as the months passed, Ian´s sight was getting bad and he constantly approached the cell phone and his books, very close to his face, in order to be able to see, in vain, his eyes grew worse every day and it was almost impossible for him to see anything, especially at night. Hovewer, every time Paris or another member of the family, insisted with him to go to the doctor, he denied, saying he was alright. _/_ Ok, so, two weeks after vacation started, everything came back normal again, despite of Ian´s poor sigh which was worrying all the family, the Portokalos was still very close, now more than ever, after losing one of their own and always stick around Paris and her dad, making sure they were alright. No need to say that they were shocked when the girl came with the idea of having a part time job at some dance school at Greek Town, instead of keeping working at Zorba´s. ''why everyone want to leave me? Why you think it´s so hard to work on the restaurant Paris?'' Kosta whinnied really upset ''what's wrong in working at the dance studio? It´s just two days a week and just half the day Pappou, don´t be upset'' ''it´s nothing wrong dear, your pappou is just been annoying'' Maria said, giving her husband a hard look; since her daughter Toula died, the old Greek woman never objected her granddaughter´s wishes. ''thanks Yjayja. What are you think Dad?'' she asked her father, who was trying to put coffee on his cup, without missing it ''as long you stay safe honey, you can do whatever you want, I say go for it, but if you think it´s a strange place, get out as soon as possible'' Ian said calmly. _/_ Paris started to work at the dance studio right the next Tuesday and as she told her father, she was loving been there, it was great, she had made a few friends and of course, it made possible to her, been close to the guy she was a crush on, a strong guy more or less her age name Charles 'Clark' Fletcher. One day, when she was finishing her shift, Paris came across a yellow paper which was being announced, a dance class for seniors. She looked at it closely and kept the paper inside her jacket. It will be a great idea, Paris thought, between working at the restaurant and work in both houses, the teenage realized her grandmother was very sad and decided that a bit of dancing lesions, would cheer her up. _/_ Once back home, Paris found her grandmother cooking something at the oven. The good news, it was she could talk to her alone, but on the other hand, she got worried. ''hi Yjayja. Where's Dad?'' she asked, worried that Ian could hurt himself with his poor sight. ''honey Mou!'' Maria exclaimed ''don´t worry, Thia Voula and Theos Taki convinced your dad to go to the eye doctor, they must been arriving in any minute. Pappou and Theo Nicko are still at the restaurant.'' She said ''I see…'' the girl said ''Yjayja, you would like to go Thursday with me to the dance studio?'' ''of course sweetheart, why?'' ''it´s a surprise, I tell you when we got there'' Paris replies, when they heard a car approached and a minute later, Ian got into the house, followed by Aunt Voula and Uncle Taki ''hey Dad!'' the girl approached her father and hug him ''how the doctor´s going?'' she asked. ''alright'' he said, not convinced ''Maria, do you mind call the whole family? I need to say something and it´s better to everyone to know right away'' Ian asked and for some reason, Paris felt a cold down her stomach. _/_ At Ian´s request, the whole family join at the Portokalos main house, so he could explain what was happening with his eyes. It happened that he has a bad case of cataracts in both eyes and the regular usage of contact lenses, had hurt his eyes very bad. ''the doctor said I need to undergo surgery, otherwise, the cataract may worsen and end up blinding me'' he said and the family froze. ''I told you, you need to start eat meat, to get your eyes healthy again'' Aunt Voula scold him ''Dad and when you will have the surgery?'' Paris asked in fear ''I didn´t say anything yet'' he said ''i´m amazed!'' Kosta exclaimed '' Ian, you're not Greek, just baptized Greek, no wonder you're having eyes problem, we Greeks have perfect sight!'' ''Toula wore glasses dad'' Nick reminded his father who couldn´t argue back. ''I was talking about Greek men'' he correct himself. For the past hour the family spends arguing about Greek culture over eye health, but as always ended assuring Ian he would be okay, with the help of the family. _/_ Thursday then, as promised, while Ian was at school working and the rest of the family were busy with their own matters, Paris and Maria headed to the dance studio, when the girl decided to tell her grandmother the surprise. ''look at this Yjayja'' the girl said showing the wold woman the paper ''I found this dance classes for old people and I thought maybe you would like to have some'' ''honey mou, I already know what to dance'' Maria laughed ''we know Greek dance Yjayja, there´s at least fifth other kind of dances in the world, why not learn another one for exchange. You can then teach Pappou how to dance it'' Paris tried to convince her grandmother, who looked at her with sparkle in her eyes. ''you know, I think some dance classes isn´t a bad idea at all, my dear, you have to know, all the women of this family, love to learn new things. Besides, I will love to prove Pappou that the Greece isn´t the center of the universe'' Maria decided, making her granddaughter smile[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2 – RELATIONSHIPS At 73-years old, Maria Portokalo couldn´t believe she was going for a dance class, with all the other important things she had to do in her day by day. Still, that Tuesday, while her only female grandchild helps with the studio´s cleaning, the old woman prepared to start classes. ''an hour of distraction, one day of week, wont going to kill anyone and I still going to hae a lot of time to work at the restaurant'' she told herself as starting the class. The classes itself started smooth, since most of the student is over fifty, the instructor, Mr. Cruz proved to be patient with his students and always correcting quietly where they should improve. Out of habit of course, Maria always shouted a loud ''OPA!'' every time they started dance and one of those days, Paris couldn´t help but laugh and record her grandmother dancing on video. _/_ Out of the dance class, life was normal as always. Every morning the old couple goes to the restaurant with Paris who despite not enjoying still had her garlic-bread shift. The other members of the family goes to their own business as well and even Ian goes to school to catch up with work. But as always they got back to the restaurant to lunch time. One of those days, the family had gathered at their restaurant, and Kosta turned to speak with his wife when she entered late and tired at the establishment ''Maria where are you been?'' asked the old man ''I was at my dance lesions'' she said ''I told you, you forgot?'' ''Ma, are you having dance lesions? It´s wonderful'' said Athena with a smile, caring a tray of spanakopita to the kitchen. ''yes'' she said ''today we learned the basics of dancing salsa'' ''salsa, salsa, The Greeks invented Salsa. And you´re too old to learn things'' ''I'm too old? You´re five years older than me and learned to use the computer'' the old woman replies angry ''because I needed to prove my ancestry and you don´t need to learn new things'' Kosta said ''ah, stop it you two, will scare your own customers out of the restaurant'' aunt Voula stop the arguing and turned to Ian, who was trying to check his cellphone ''Ian, how your eyes doing?'' '' Nothing good and I'm having headaches, trying to check my emails'' he said ''well, don´t forgot to put the eyewash as the doctor told you and schedule the surgery, I had a friend who lost her sight because of cataracts'' ''i…'' Ian tried to argue, but the old woman walk away ''since when you got so coward?'' Nick teased his brother in law ''I'm not a coward'' Ian defend himself ''I don´t want to have a surgery and have the risk of something happens to me'' he said and in response, Nick seemed to understand Ian´s point, a he stop talking and just patted his shoulder. ''hey everyone, I'm here to the Garlic-Bread'' Paris said without enthusiasm and after hugging her father, she walk toward the kitchen. ''Paris, where´s your boyfriend, it´s been a long time since he didn't come here'' Kosta said and in response, the girl and her great aunt exchange looks, realizing no one had told Kosta or even Ian about the broke up. ''i…'' ''he needs to ask your hand soon, you starting to look old!'' ''Kosta arketá! Leave her alone.'' Maria scold him and turn to her granddaughter. ''Paris go have lunch, before start working'' ''Maria, you spoil this girl very much.'' The grandfather replies ''Ian, Listen, if that boy comes to your house again, tell him to marry ask Pari´s hand soon, or stop been around her.'' Upon hearing that, the girl just rolled her eyes and goes to the kitchen. ''Paris!'' the girl got back upon hearing her dad calling her ''what Dad?'' ''your grandparents invited us to dinner tonight, so don't make any plans, ok?'' ''sure Dad'' she said without enthusiastic. ''Maria!'' Voula changed the subject calling her sister aside ''you could show me these dance classes, Taki is saying I'm getting boring'' ''you will be always welcome my sister'' the other woman smiled and hey continue to talk about other things. _/_ The day rushed and later that same evening, Paris and Ian went to the Miller´s house for a dinner. However, this time, however, it was a bit different, since Ian was forbidden to drive by his doctor and Paris didn't knew how to drive, someone of the Greek family had to give them a ride there and ended up, to let the evening more awkward that Angelo and his partner Patrick had gone with Paris and Ian there and also stayed for dinner. Most of the night was filled with silence, since the old Miller couple was a bit bewildered in front of the two men holding hands and didn´t know what to say. To break the silence, Rodney changed the subject, he didn´t knew his only son was having sight problem, but once Ian told him about the cataracts case, the old couple hurriedly to say they would help with everything. ''why didn´t you ask us to take you to the doctor?'' Rodney asked ''my parents tied him in the car and took him to a doctor'' Angelo teased and Ian and Paris laughed ''well, Thanks Maria and Gus for us'' Rodney nodded and Ian frowned ''Maria and Gus are my in-laws'' Ian corrects him ''my parents are Voula and Taki'' Angelo said and both Paris and Patrick chuckled ''I see…'' Harry smiled ''Rodney, you don´t have a friend who are ophthalmologist? Ian can visit him for a checkup and a second opinion'' ''Phil Webster is the one you are you talking about? He´s a teacher at the blind school, Harriet, he isn´t a doctor'' Mr. Miller correct her. A few more minutes of silence went by and the old woman talks again. ''Paris sweetie, are you enjoying work at the dance studio?'' the girl nodded ''oh, wonderful'' she said and turned to Patrick ''are you the owner there?'' ''no, Ma´am, i´m an architect'' he said ''Yjayja…'' Paris started. Since she was a kid she opted to call both sets of grandparents of ''Yjayja and Pappou'' to avoid confusion to her ''I took Yjayja Maria to some dance lessons, if you want to go there as well, I give you the address.'' She said and in response the old woman just nodded and the silence filled the room once again _/_ Next Tuesday come quickly as Maria and Paris arrived at the dance studio with Aunt Voula, who was excited to watch a few classes. Of course, that decision annoyed Kosta and he and Maria argued again. Once the classes finished the two Greek sisters walked toward the exit when they spot Paris talking with another tall man, they are smiling. Curious, the two women resolved to approach the young couple, to know what they were talking about. ''honey mou, who is this?'' Maria asked with a smile ''hi Yjayja, Theia Voula'' the girl greeted ''enjoyed the classes?'' ''it was good sweetheart… are you her boyfriend?'' asked the grandmother looking at the young man ''Yjayja, this is Clark Fletcher. And yeah, we start dating a few weeks ago'' Paris blushed. ''oh.. are you Greek?'' aunt Voula asked and Clark raised his eyebrows ''no Ma´am, I'm British'' he said a bit confused ''that´s okay, no need to apologize'' she smiled patting his face ''well, to tell you the truth, I love Greek food, especially the desserts'' Clark smiled awkwardly ''oh, Good, good'' aunt Voula approves ''what a handsome boy! You are the owner here?'' asked Maria and Clark laughed ''no ma´am, I'm working as a janitor, my grandmother own the place, I'm just working at the vacation, to buy a new bicycle'' he said feeling ashamed for his childish wishes. ''that´s a good thing, we wish you luck'' Voula noted '' bike strengthens the leg muscle, it´s sexy'' ''okay, Yjayja, Thia Voula'' Paris blushed at the comment '' we have an hour to work, so, we need to go back to it'' Paris got a bit embarrassed. ''alright sweetheart, we´re going, just remember Paris, protect the Poulaki'' Maria said and walk away. Once at the street Voula shock her head, of course, she was delight that her great niece has found someone new to love, but still… ''woe to me, if Gus find out Paris is dating a non-Greek boy'' she laugh ''nothing is going to happens, Voula, it was already time to Gus learn to accept diversities. Besides, Toula was happy with a non-Greek husband, why Paris wouldn´t be?'' ''well saying my sister, well said '' Voula agreed as they make their way back to the restaurant[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 - WHAT SHE WOULD DO? The fourth week of vacation started sad to both Millers and Portokalos. A year ago, tragedy had taken the family by surprise, as Toula Portokalo- Miller, suddenly passed away from a heart disease. _/_ At the Miller´s house, Ian was trying to get himself ready to join the whole family at the cemetery. He was frustrated, his eyes had took a turn for the worse and he was barreling seen a thing, needing help almost the whole time to everything. ''Dad, how long you will take to talk to the doctor about the surgery?'' Paris asked him as they wait for someone to pick them up a few minutes later ''Dad? ''I heard Paris. And no, I didn´t say anything yet'' Ian said a bit angry ''let´s go?'' he said ignoring his daughter´s question, when hearing the doorbell hang. _/_ All the family stood in silence in front of the white mausoleum of the Portokalos family, whose format resembles a miniature of the Parthenon; for a while they stood just in silence, praying, for the only member of the family who rested there. Despite of been angry with her husband, Maria keep holding herself into him, as they cry the loss of their youngest daughter. To Ian everything was a blur, not only in his eyes, but hart as well. Those days, more than ever he wished that his wife was by his side. He started to cry silently, letting the tears burn his eyes as he force them to read the name at the gravestone. In vain. How much he missed her, he loved and still love her very much, his personal Greek statue, his heart ached at the last memories he shared with her. And thinking they almost got the chance of a new heart. Part of him, thought, maybe he should get the surgery, it was just an easy thing, to fix his sight, but part of him, preferred to goes blind, rather than die on the hospital and left Paris without her only living parent. At her dad´s side, the teen whipped as she remembered the last thing her mother said to her. She bent down then, placed the flower she had brought at the top of the tomb and said a couple of words to her mom. One by one, each member of the Portokalo family did the same, when it was Nick´s turn, he bent down and took the opportunity to tease his brother-in-law again \"Hey Sis, whatever you are, you better send some light to your husband, he got a bit coward nowadays'' he teased ''Nicko, stop this'' his mother scold him \"show some respect! At your sister´s resting place\" \" sorry Ma! \" ''I already told you, I have my motives to don´t want to have the eye surgery'' Ian said annoyed. The family continued to share memories about Toula for the next hour, then, after another pray and wishes to the woman rest in peace, the family gone away. _/_ After the cemetery, Paris and Athena goes to Nikki´s salon, Angelo and Taki went to the pet shop they owned and while Maria went to a friend´s house for a tea and distractions, the rest of the family gathered in the restaurant. Gus on the other hand, was sad, once everyone took their seats, he seat together, but keep staring at the salt shaker, without enthusiasm. ''what´s the matter Dad?'' the Nick asked patting the older man shoulder ''I´m just trying to understand what is the matter with your mother, she´s been avoiding me.'' He said ''a lot'' ''you called her old, it is a big motive'' Voula defended her sister ''yeah but, today is a day to all of us stay together… and she preferred to drink tea with some friend from that dance school.'' ''she just want some time to herself Gus'' Ian intervene ''it´s a hard day to everyone'' he said rubbing his eyes. ''if she´s having an affair?'' the old man asked worried ''don´t be ridiculous Gus!'' Voula scold him ''you know very well that Greek women don´t have lovers, when we find the right someone, is to get merry and be happy for the rest of our lives'' she said and in response, it was Ian who lowered his head, sad. ''well, anyway, Ian, I'm getting worried, that Boy, Bennett, he disappear out of nowhere'' said the old man ''I don´t know'' Ian said ''every time I ask about him, Paris changed the subject.'' The father replies ''they had broken up'' Voula said out of sudden and the two men looked at her ''what you mean broken up Thia?'' Nick asked ''she told me just that, they had broken up, what´s the problem with that?'' ''why she didn't told me?'' Ian seemed confused ''because it´s a girl subject. Could you three stop asking questions?'' she said as Nick spotted a young man on the street, looking around the place, before getting in the restaurant. It was Clark ''good afternoon'' he said ''this is the Dancing Zorba´s?'' ''yeah?!'' Gus nodded ''hi, my name is Charles Fletcher i work with Paris at the dance studio'' he said ''she missed work today and I thought to come here and see if she´s okay'' ''Clark!'' Aunt Voula exclaimed, walking toward him with a smile ''Come, have a seat with us'' she said ''Paris isn´t here now, but you´re welcome to have some coffee'' she smiled ''well, I would love to, but I'm really busy right now, I just passed by to have some news on Paris'' he apologized ''but thanks a million anyway'' he said walking away Once Clark go away, the family looked to each other in confusion and The first thing Kosta asked, was if Clark was Greek, but when Voula replies the kid was British, the old man just shook his head disappointed, his whole life was just wrong. _/_ Next day, Paris got back to the dance studio, it was her last week working there and she wanted to stay with her friends, especially Clark. She was really fond of him and couldn't wait to introduce him to her father and the other members of her family. As the two teens help a teacher clean the one of the class rooms, Clark decided to approach the girl, in order to know why she had missed the work the day before. He also noticed that she was a bit down that day, which worried him. \"Hey Paris\" he greeted her \"it's everything alright?\" \" Yeah, why? \" she asked, putting one tatami aside \"You missed work yesterday, so I went to your restaurant, in order to know how you are, but you aren't there.\" \" Oh, yeah, yesterday wasn't a good day and i wanted to stay with my family. Plus, my dad is having a very serious eye problem, but refused to go find a doctor to fix it\" she said ''that's sucks'' he agreed '' your mother must be very worry as well'' he said and in response, Paris just lowered her head, making him realize that in some way he had said a bad thing '\"As i was saying… '' He changed the subject quickly '' i hope your father get well soon. And by the way, your family seems very fun.\" \" Thanks! \" paris seemed a little awkward \"and you managed to have a lunch at the restaurant?\" She changed the subject \"I haven't, i was very busy and just passed by there to know where you had gone, but i intent to come back there other day for a Baklava.\" \"What about next Tuesday? It will be my last day of work, we could celebrate!\" Paris suggested. \"I think it's an awesome idea\" Clark agreed, giving her a kiss on the cheek as they get back to work. _/_ Once Paris get home, she found Ian seat in the couch, with almost all the room in the dark, except for the reading lamp. The light has been hurting his eyes a lot now. So there he was, seating in the living-room, looking at nothing. Their dog Patches was lying down at the couch, sleeping. \"Hey Dad!\" She greeted him \"Paris, we need to talk.\" Ian said straight to the point. Since the day before, she realized her dad was a bit distant, at first, she thought it was because of the day, but he was just worry about her. \"What s it Dad?\" She asked \" Honey, why didn't you told me you had broken up with your boyfriend? \" he asked \"Why are you worry about this Dad?\" The girl got confused. \"Look, if you weren't happy with him, you are more than right to walk away from him.\" Ian start \"but think of it, you got depressed for days, you get me very worried about you, for days, i was very anxious actually, trying to find out a way to help you.\" \" Sorry Dad \" the girl said a bit ashamed \"you had so much in your mind, that i didn't wanted to worry you even more\" she said and in response, he reached out for her. Without another word, she seat beside him and rest her head on his chest. \"Paris, i'm your dad, the first thing i want in life is your happiness... Doesn't matter all the problem I'm going through, i will put it aside, to help you be happy again\" he said ''I miss Mom, wish she could be here'' the girl said ''me too honey'' Ian said sadly \"Dad? What you think Mom would do?\" She asked and Ian took a deep breath \" about what? The broken up? \" he asked \"Everything actually.\" \" Knowing your mom, she would want to fix everything, she would make your grandparents stop arguing with each other all the time. Certainly she would want to know why you broken up... \" Paris laugh at that. \"And i would be on my way to the eye surgery already.\" Upon hearing that, the girl looked at her dad again, his eyes were getting cloudy and she felt tightness on her chest on that. \"Dad, what Theos Nick said, about you been a coward when it come to the surgery thing, i know he's teasing you, but why you're so afraid?\" \" Paris... \" he started \"i don't know what expect of this surgery, i really don't. So i don't want to take a risk and let something happens to me, i know i can go blind if i didn't have this surgery, but i prefer to lie the rest of my life in the dark, rather than left you alone\" he explained \"Ah Dad!\" The girl hug him back \" hey, look at this \" she took the cellphone from her pocket, put the video on and give it to her father, who place it inches from his nose, looking at the blur in front of him. \"Its your grandmother?\" \" Yep, i filmed her dancing\" she laugh \"Humm\" Ian raised his eyebrows \"i think you taking her to these dance lesson, was indeed a very good idea, she seems to dance very nicely\" he agreed. _/_ Meanwhile, at the Portokalos main house, Gus and Maria were again, arguing with each other. As they have dinner, the old man told his wife about his suspicious, letting her furious \"After everything we gone through Kosta, what made you think i would have an affair?\" \" You have been avoiding me Maria, you only think about these damn classes, you barely stay at the restaurant and if not, you spend more time at Ian´s house than here... Speaking of it, you know a guy from your dance classes, goes to the restaurant, looking for Paris? \" \"Yeah, Gus, he is her boyfriend, just this.\" She said angry \"and what the problem i wanting to have a time for myself? I spend my whole life taking care of this family, i lost a child...\" \" we lost our child\" Kosta correct her \"I just want a time to distract myself. And don't worry, I'm not having any affair\" she snapped \"but till you apologize to me, i will sleep at the guest room\" she left the main room, slamming the door behind her.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 4 - FIXING EVERYTHING Once Ian told Paris, her mother would try to fix things between the families, Paris decided to take matters to her own hands and try to fix everything, as Toula would do. Starting with her dad. Next morning after their conversation, Paris goes to the eye doctor with Ian, in order to understand what was really happening with his eyes. And it happened it was a bit worse than they thought. After a few tests, the new doctor comes with the diagnosis. Indeed Ian has cataracts, but what was making him lose his sight slowly, was a bit of glaucoma as well. Fortunately, the doctor said it has cure and once they found it in early stage, they didn't have much to worry as the chance of him became blind was very slim. Of course, both sides of Paris family get together to help and celebrate when Ian finally agreed to have the surgery in his eyes, by the end of that month. Meanwhile, Maria took the opportunity to spend more time at Ian s house, as she was still angry with Kosta. _/_ At the afternoon after her last day of work at the Dance studio, Paris invited Clark for a lunch at Zorba´s. that day also, the family had host a small celebration, to toast the 'Coward Lion' as Nick was calling Ian now days. ''The Coward Lion?'' asked the tall man ''you know, from the books, a coward lion wanted his courage back'' Nick said ''you never read that book?'' ''it´s surprise me you knowing 'The Wizard of Oz'' Ian was really surprise ''thank you, my dear Scarecrow, I hope maybe one day you find your brain'' he said and in response his brother-in-law punched his chest and give him a bear hug. A few minutes later, the two kids walked inside the restaurant hand in hand and a smile on their faces as Paris approached her dad first. ''Dad, I want you to meet Charles Fletcher, Clark, for short. he had come to the restaurant a few days ago, looking for me'' she said as Ian reached is hand ''Nice to meet you Clark'' he smiled '' enjoy the celebration… and sorry for wearing dark glasses inside the place, the lights are hurting my eyes'' ''that´s okay Sir, I understand'' the boy said ''Paris, you are late'' Maria appear behind her granddaughter ''Clark, how good is to have you here, are you two hungry?'' ''yeah, we came for a lunch Yjayja, to celebrate our last day working at the dance studio'' said the girl'' ''good, good, I will make you something. Danny´s is offering us milkshakes for the week'' se smiled going toward the kitchen It was a fun afternoon at the restaurant, Paris could say, as both she and her boyfriend spend chatting with Ian about school and a few other things. Of course, Nick keep teasing his brother in law, till Ian paid back, calling him the Tin Man, who was still looking for a brain, everyone laughed and Aunt Voula couldnt help but make one of her awkward comment, however, the boy didn't feel embarrassed, on the contrary, he laugh and even discussed with Gus the origin of his own name. Just Aunt Athene wasn´t that pleased with her niece dating again, so soon after broking up with her first boyfriend. \"Clark, huh?\" Angelo asked \" every Charles i know is nicknamed Charlie, not Clark. \" \"It's my fault actually\" he said \"i was fun of Superman when i was younger and everyone teased me calling me Clark instead of Charlie, later then, the nickname stuck.\" He said \" Superman? \" Kosta frowned \"Hercules is stronger than Superman, kid, I'm sure of this\" he said and both Paris and Clark laughed. _/_ After Clark gone away home, a few hours later, Paris gone down at the restaurant office to ask her granddad a ride back home and found the old man, searching through his wife´s photos at Facebook, with a long frown on his face. Most of the lasted photos, the old woman was hanging out with some of her friends at the studio and looking happy ''look at this!'' he said when Paris approach Pappou, can you give dad and me a ride home?\" She asked changing the subject \" just wait a minute\" he said \"look at this!\" \" What is it Pappou? \" Paris was confused, but when she approach the computer annoyed \"This isn't right!\" The old man complained \"What isn't right Pappou?\" \"your grandmother is neglecting family. She prefer to be away from us and this is wrong\" \"Pappou, i coaxed Yjayja to have the dance classes, she needed a few distractions, she miss mom and that was making her sad\" \"Paris, everyone here misses your mother, i know your Yjayja is upset, everyone are, but it's isn't an excuse to neglect family\" he said, but before the granddaughter could replies, they heard someone approaching. \"Paris, let's go home, your uncle will give us a ride\" Ian called her \"I'm coming Dad!\" She said and turn to her grandfather \" Pappou, you and Yjayja should talk with each other again, please, for me? \" she give him a kiss on his forehead and rush upstairs. _/_ Next day by the morning, Paris was alone at home, Mr. Taki took Ian to a new check up with the doctor before the surgery and she decided to walk around the block with the dog, in order to to think in a way to make her grandparents make up again. As she got back into the empty house, she plopped herself in the couch and stared at her parent´s wedding photo with a sad look. ''URGH! Mom, give me a light, what I should do?'' she growled, hiding her face in her hands ''who are you talking too dear?'' the girl jumped at her great aunt´s voice. ''hi Thia!'' she greeted the old woman ''my dear, what´s the matter?'' she asked, sitting beside the girl. ''I was tingiking in a way to make Yjayja and Pappou make up again and …'' she said ''My Dear!'' the old lady stop her ''no need to worry about this, worries will only leave you with many wrinkles and Clark will not want you anymore'' Paris blushed with that comment ''you are just like your mother, always wanting to fix everything, but as I said, don´t worry your grandparents are stubborn, but they love each other, they will make up sometime'' ''but…'' ''don´t, no more talk about this, you need to worry about something else. Like why to buy for your return to college'' ''Thia Voula, I completely forgot about college'' Paris jumped at her feet, pale and worry, but before the old woman could say something, thhe door opened and Mr. Taki entered leading the way to Ian \"Hey Dad, how the doctor gone?\" Asked Paris, a bit anxious. \" Good news\" smiled the father \"a week from now, i will seeing everything straight, as it should. Sure, Dr. Kavinsky said i will probably need to use glasses again and do periodic exams in the eye, to prevent the glaucoma to do more damage, but i will be just fine\" he said and explain about the procedure. \" \"Oh, thanks havens you will not undergo a cornea transplant, it doesn't work, i knew someone who got blind because of that, right Taki?!\" Thea Voula asked her husband who agree. _/_ Later that same evening, father and daughter have dinner together, this time, just the two of them, without anyone of the family around, when Paris told Ian about the plan she had shared with Aunt Voula earlier. \"Honey, i know you want to make your grandparents get a long again\" Ian said seriously \"but look at this, i don't want a fight with your grandparents now, i don't think we should poke our noses around them this time\" he said and the daughter nodded \"I was thinking of what Mom would do. I dont think she would be pleased seen Yjayja and Pappou fighting again\" she said\" i thought of... I don't know... Fix everything, since i started this mess, taking Yjayja to the dance studio. \"Ian took a deep breath and pondered the situation. \"One thing you're right, your mother would try to fix everything\" Ian agreed pressing his eyes \"you know, i think you're right, we should do something to help your grandparents.\" He said \" let's call your uncle Nick after dinner and see if he want to help us\" \"Thanks Dad... Dad, you think Mom would like to meet Clark? \" \"I suppose so. He's a nice guy, i liked him anyway\" he said and Paris laughed. _/_ Next day by the morning, as she had done the last few weeks, Maria gone to another classes; she was excited, as Mr. Cruz had told the students, they would learn tango that day. Once she left, Nick and Ian gone to the Portokalo main house to pick up Gus, who at the moment, was having breakfast alone and got very surprise upon seen his son and son in law there. \"Dad, we want to take you somewhere\" Nick said in a hush, before his father could say something. \"I don't want to go anywhere, i need to go to the restaurant, i have work to do\" he said angry \"Athena will open the restaurant Dad, don't worry\" \" Its just a couple of hours Gus\" Ian said, already regretting in helping paris with her plan. The night before, they called Nick and decided to take Gus to watch Maria dancing in the next morning, however, the teenager didn't join them, instead, she had gone to Nikki's salon to help her there. After a few minutes of discussion, they managed to take the old man outside the house, sure, they didn't tell Kosta they are taking him to the dance studio, otherwise, he would refuse to go, so they make up an excuse, changing the subject, every time Kosta asked where they are going. Once they got there, the old man got furious, telling his son and son and law, they had deceive him, still, both Nick and Ian convince him to go inside and at least take a look at h is wife dancing, assuming that he will enjoy, as much as herself did. as They got there, the first person they come across, was Clark, he was talking to an old woman, probably his grandmother, but stopped as soon as he spot Paris family arriving. He greets them and introduced them to his grandmother. \"It's always a pleasure\" smiled the old woman \"Charles talked so much about the Greek family of his girlfriend, i'm very glad to meet you all\" she said \"now i have to go, have a pleasant visit. And Mr. Miller, i will pray for your recovery go smooth\" \"Thanks\" said the tall man \"er... Excuse me, could you show us where the dance classes are happening?\" \" i will show you guys, follow me \" Clark offered. \"Thanks kid. Come on Dad\" Nick placed a hand over his father's shoulder and lead him and Ian toward the right class. _/_ Mr. Cruz was in the middle of the lesson and didn't seem happy when Clark entered followed by the three other men. \"Sorry, Mr. Cruz, they are Paris family, they want to watch a performance\" say the young man. While they talked, Kosta finally had spotted his wife dancing with one of the instructors; she was dancing perfectly and the old man felt something strange inside his chest. In the middle of the dance space, Maria had stop dancing and upon seen her family standing there in the entrance, she walked toward them, with a happy but confused look on her face \"What are you doing here? She asked \" Hi Ma\" Nick greeted his mother \"We took Gus to see you dance...\" Ian tries to defense himself \"You dance wonderful\" the old man smiled, unsurprising his wife. \" thank you\" the older woman almost melted inside \"Why didn't you tell me you danced so nicely\" \"Oh Gus, you even had given me the chance\" she said, making the old man smiled and give her a small kiss. They had made up at least. Everything was well again.[Chapter 5] The last chapter. I hope you had enjoy my story. Thanks DSCWin and Colbiwest for having read and review my story, sorry if the ending was cliche, i confess i had To Improvise, Since I didn't had find a perfect end. Thanks Again and despite of not knowing if i will write anything more on this storyline, i will be back soon to write more stories on this movie. Your friend Dr. Serpico CHAPTER 5 - A BIT OF HAPPINESS IN THE END. It was a great day to Ian, as he get ready for the surgery in his eyes. No need to say, that early that day, almost the whole family, both Portokalos and Millers had gone to his house, help him and Paris settled everything and get ready to go to the hospital. There's also a lot of fuss, which let Paris annoyed. No one however, told Ian that Paris had freak out after he had disappeared trough the double doors of the hospital, on his way to the O.R. Once her father had disappeared from sight, the girl started to cry, in fear of losing her father, despite Dr. Kavinsky himself telling the family over and over it was a simple procedure and her dad would be just fine by the evening. As they was been said, the surgery was a success, but they kept the tall man in the hospital for the night, just for precaution. Paris almost cried when she saw her dad with those bandages over his eyes, but happy that he was going to be fine. _/_ During the time while Ian recovered , his daughter spend time helping him with his recover, going on small dates with Clark and just hanging around with her family or her friends, as well as arranging things to get back to college . Besides, with Kosta and Maria happily married again, the whole family seemed to be happy. One evening then, while the family were just spend time together, the old woman called her granddaughter aside and give her a bear hug. \"What is it Yjayja?\" She asked confused \"Just want to thank you honey mou, for give me the opportunity to have those classes, i really enjoy it and i will continue it\" She smiled \"You're welcome Yjayja\" Paris couldn't help but blushed as her grandmother split her and give her a kiss on the cheeks. TWO WEEKS LATER... After two hours of airplane and an hour of car, the family finally reached the small resort they intended to spend the two last weeks of vacation, before Paris had to go back to Northwestern. It also a way they have to celebrate Ian s full recovery from the surgery. Sure, as the doctor had told him, the man had to get back on wearing glasses. And as bad news, he will probably starting lost his sight one day, but not until five years, so he had time to prepare himself. _/_ It was the best weeks of their lives, since the tragedy that strikes them. As always, they drank, dance eat and be loud as if nothing had happened to them. On the last night of the resort, it was also the owner birthday and the whole salon was decorated for a party, where all costumers join for celebrate. \"Come on Kosta, let's dance!\" Maria get up from the chair and pull her husband for a dance \"I don't know how to!\" He admitted \" Don't worry, i will teach you\" the old woman bent down and kissed the old man who got up and followed his wife to the dance space. One by one, the family members entered the dance space, trying to follow that so strange dance to them. Only Ian keep seated at his table, watching everyone, he doesn't have anyone to dance with, so it was useless join a dance that wasn't Greek. \"Hey Dad, come dance\" said Paris, with enthusiasm. \"No honey, thanks!\" He said \" Come on son. \" Both father and daughter looked confused at Kosta standing next them. \"Son?\" The tall man felt strange , his father in law never called him as son, in any circumstances. \"Yeah, you're my son in law right? You didn't married my daughter?\" \" come on Dad, lets have some fun! \" Paris insisted \"you need to have some fun, i'm sure mom would love to see you now\" she said \"In this case...\" Ian smiled getting up \" let's go for it then! \" he laughed placing an arm around his daughter's shoulder and following his family to the dance space. _/_ Two days later, once back in their house, Maria found herself sitting on her comfortable couch, flipping trough the photos of her wedding day, the real one. It was been an year and a half after that and it's seems like an eternity, taking into account everything what had happened in the meantime. The older woman took a deep breath, trying to calm her heavy heart and prevent the tears to fall down. \"Maria, where are you?\" Kosta's voice come from the kitchen \" In the living-room Gus! \" she said and seconds later the old man appears. \"What are you doing?\" \"I was feeling a bit nostalgic\" she said as the husband seated beside her. \"You know Kosta, during these time i have for myself at th e dance classes, i realized, how important is the time we stay together as family, we need each other. I said it was been a good life and it's still is and i'm more then happy to have you by my side\" \"I've missed you during this time you were away\" He give her a kiss on the cheek \" I missed you too\" she said holding his hand \"you know, it had been a few days i heard you calling Ian as son, when we were at the resort.\" She said and rest her head on his shoulder. \" I'm very proud of you. And i'm sure whatever she is, our daughter is proud of you as well. \" Upon hearing that, the old man just smiled, but didn't made any comment, just taking into account his wife wad right and as matter of fact, whatever she was, Toula was indeed smiling down to proudly at her family THE END . ","Summary":" Hello! Thee story bellow it´s a story about dance and recover from a tragedy. I will not explain mu"},{"Movie":"Bloomington","Title":"I'm Only Holding On By A Thin, Thin Thread","Author":"greystone2009","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9328010","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I don't own anything! Music was playing over the speakers in the living room and the bottle of scotch was sitting on the coffee table. The music that was playing wasn't quite loud enough to drown out the noise of that rain and she was ok with that. Catherine sat on her couch, with what was her second glass of scotch, and wondered how things had gotten so messed up between her and Jackie. Just a few short weeks ago they had both been sitting on that very same couch talking and laughing about something funny that happened during class. Things had been going so well for Catherine and Jackie. After they had met, they quickly fell into a comfortable groove and spent as much time as possible together. Things were going so well for the two of them, but there was always a nagging feeling in the back of Catherine's mind that something was going to happen. At the beginning of their relationship she had asked Jackie if she was scared about being together. Even though Catherine insisted that everything was going to be fine and nothing would happen, there was always a part of her that didn't believe her own words. She wasn't worried about being found out by the school and losing her job, she was worried that Jackie would get bored of her and move on. So when Jackie told her about the possible acting job back in L.A., Catherine tried to hide her jealousy. Unfortunately, she didn't do a very good job trying to hide it. She had been with other students, but the truth was Jackie was different. She wanted to spend every waking minute with her. She had to forcer herself not to look at her during class, it was so hard not to get lost in her gaze while she was teaching. Jackie brought this other side of Catherine that most people didn't get to see, it was this fun and carefree side. She finished what was left of her glass and poured another. She brought the glass to her head, it felt cool to the touch and she closed her eyes as a single tear fell down her check. Maybe if she tried hard enough she could turn back time and say things she wanted to and take back other hurtful things that she had said. As she was sat on the couch with Ethan curled up next to her a song started playing that made her cry even more. \" Man it's been a long day Stuck thinking bout it Driving on the freeway Wonderin if I really Tried everything I could Not knowing if I should Try a little a harder Oh but I'm scared to death That there may not be Another one like this And I confess That I'm only holding on By a thin thin thread\" Truer words had never been spoken. Since Jackie had walked out of her house just a few short days ago, all she could think about was what she could have done or should have done. She didn't want to come between Jackie and her career, but maybe they could have worked something out. Jackie was worth whatever they had to go through to be together. Not a minute went by that she didn't regret saying that she wasn't worth it. They had both said things out of anger that night after the party, but Catherine deeply regretted saying, \"maybe I don't think you're worth it.\" The second those words slipped out of her mouth she felt awful. \" I'm kickin the curb Cause you never heard The words that you needed so bad And I'm kickin the dirt cause I never gave you The things that you needed to have I'm so sad... sad Man it's been a long night Just sittin' here Trying not to look back Still looking at the Road we never drove on And wonderin if the one I chose was the right one\" Jackie asked her if she was different and Catherine wanted to jump and scream and say YES, but she was scared to let herself go there. She never let anyone else spend the night and she certainly never would have let anyone else take her flying. Catherine had no problem talking to Jackie while she was sleeping, and now she wishes she would have. She told Jackie she loved her and that she loved spending time with her. Looking back on the last few months she couldn't remember making that same comment to her while she was awake and she knew she should have. \" Oh but I'm scared to death That there may not be Another one like this And I confess That I'm only holding on By a thin thin thread\" Catherine finished her glass of scotch and put the glass back on the coffee table. She should go to bed, but the thought of being in her bed and not seeing Jackie curled up next to her, was such a depressing feeling. She had been sleeping on the couch for the last few nights because every time she saw her bed, she thought of Jackie and ached to be with her. She put her head on the back of the couch and didn't even try to stop the flow of tears. She had screwed up and would do anything to get back the one person she ever truly cared about. Ok, so I just watched this movie the other day and I can't get it out of my head. They ending of the movie really bugged me! I thought about writing a different one, but I heard this song the other day and I just had to write something. Not sure if I'll keep this one going or not. I might just start a new one. Anyway, let me know what you think! The song is called Sad by Maroon 5. I don't own it.[Chapter 2] I don't own ANYTHING! Run. Jackie finally finished her last class of the day. It had been a long day and she was very thankful when she was walking out of her last class. She was used to having a pretty busy schedule, but she was starting to second guess the workload she had. Taking six classes didn't seem so hard on paper, but by the end of the third week of school she was already exhausted. As she walked back to her dorm she considered dropping one class just to lighten the school load a bit. She liked most of her teachers though, so she wasn't sure what class to drop. When she got to her dorm she changed into her workout clothes and decided to go to the gym. However, on her way to the gym she couldn't stop thinking about her classes and decided to stop in to talk to one of her professors. It was almost 5pm and she wasn't even sure if her professor would be in her office. When she walked up to the door she saw her professor come out of the office. Jackie quickly changed her mind and thought it would be best to just try again another day. As she was walking away she heard, \"Psych 210, Tuesdays and Thursdays right?\" Jackie stopped and turned around facing the professor, \"Uh, yeah. Sorry I saw that you were leaving and I didn't want to bother you. I'll come back another day.\" Jackie started to walk away when the professor started talking again, \"I was just leaving early because none of my students bothered using my office hours. I've got some time.\" Her professor had a very charming and welcoming smile. Truth be told, she kind had a thing for her professor, which is why she chose her to come talk to in the first place. \"Ok sure, thanks\" they young student responded. \"We haven't really been introduced, my name is Catherine Stark. You're…..Jacqueline Kirk right?\" The student gave the professor a quizzical look. \"That's a pretty good memory from roll call three weeks ago\" Jackie said. \"Well, you are the first famous student I've ever had! So, what can I help you with Miss Kirk? I'm guessing you're not here because you have questions about today's lecture.\" Catherine leaned back in her chair and studied the student in front of her. \"Um, well yeah. How did you know?\" Jackie asked, slightly confused. \"Well for one you look like you're ready to go work out and secondly, you don't have your backpack or even a notebook with you.\" Jackie laughed a little and then realized how ridiculous she probably did look wearing her gym clothes. \"Ok, I was hoping to get your opinion on something…\" she paused for a second and gave her professor a glance that looked like she was asking for permission to continue. She was granted permission by a slight head nod. \"…this whole college thing is pretty new to me, I thought I could handle six classes, but I just don't know if I can. I know I still have one week left until I can drop a class without penalty, but I'm just really torn.\" Her professor continued to study her for what seemed like ages, finally Jackie stood up and said, \"You know what Professor Stark, I'm sorry to waste your time, I should get going.\" Catherine let out a small chuckle and stood up, \"Wait Jacqueline, you don't need to leave. Let's talk about this for a minute. I've been told I give pretty good advice.\" And there it was again, that charming smile. Catherine led Jackie to a couch that was by the window. \"Why did you sign up for six classes?\" \"I thought I could handle it.\" \"What classes are you taking?\" \"Well, your class, Stats 105, English 110, Psych 106, US History, and Into to Astronomy.\" \"I see, that sounds like a tough load. You know, you can spread out your general ed classes so you're not taking them all at once. Which class are you thinking about dropping?\" Jackie was sitting in the far end of the couch with her leg shaking, nervously glancing around. Suddenly she felt a hand on her knee and the shaking stopped. \"Nervous habit?\" Catherine asked. Instantly Jackie felt like she was on fire and could barely respond with a simple yes. \"Why are you so nervous?\" \"Never mind, um, it's nothing.\" \"Don't believe everything you hear, Jacqueline. So, which class are you thinking about dropping?\" \"Well, honestly yours.\" Jackie could have sworn she saw a hint of sadness in the professor's eyes, but only for a second and it was gone. \"If you're worried about the homework in that class, it's not nearly as hard as you think it's going to be. And I can help you if you need be. I would really hate to see you drop the class.\" Catherine slid a little closer to Jackie and the warm feeling came back to Jackie. \"You've got potential, I would hate to see you waste it.\" \"Ok, um, thanks and please, just call me Jackie.\" She was about to stand up when she felt a Catherine's hand on top of her's and another hand on the back of her neck pulling her closer. \"Ok….Jackie\" Catherine whispered as she leaned in and softly kissed the younger student. The kiss was over almost as soon as it started. Jackie was in frozen in place and couldn't take her eyes off of Catherine who leaned back just enough to look at her. \"Are you ok?\" Catherine quietly asked. Jackie's heart was racing a thousand miles an hour and slowly nodded. \"Can I kiss you again?\" Jackie nodded again and felt Catherine's lips covered hers. It didn't take long until she felt Catherine's tongue press against her lips asking for permission to enter. She hesitated for a second before granting access. So many thoughts and emotions were running through Jackie's head. She knew if she didn't leave soon, she wouldn't have the power to say no the beautiful woman next to her. She put her hand on Catherine's arm and quickly stood up saying, \"I'm sorry, I think I need to leave.\" Before Catherine could say anything, Jackie was out the door. It took all of Jackie's control not to sprint to the gym. She needed a distraction from what just happened and she was hoping that the gym would provide that distraction. Jackie loved to run, so after a quick stretch and warm up she decided to hit up the indoor track that was in the gym. She loved it because not too many people used it and it was always cool inside. Typically she would listen to her workout playlist, but this time she just hit shuffle on her iPod and started running. After about 30 minutes of running a song came on that was she certain she'd heard before, but it sounded so different and so much more intense now. I wanna watch you undress I wanna watch you glow Let your hair down All around, cover us both You come in a wave We crash and we roll You surround me, pull me, drown me, swallow me whole You turn, turn, turn, turning me on Know that it's wrong Still I run, run, run, run right into you Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you This song stopped her dead in her tracks, she was absorbing every word like it was brand new information. The indoor track overlooked the basketball courts and as she stood there listening to the words, her mind wondered back to her professors office. She could still feel those lips pressed against hers and she could still taste the older woman's tongue. Involuntarily, she licked her lips as she thought about the encounter. In just a matter of minutes her professor had turned her world upside down. You pull me in close You buckle my knees I shake and I shiver just to feel you breathe You trace my lines Stirring my soul Shoot sparks at the heart of the world and I watch it explode She would be lying if she said she wished she wasn't back in that office in the arms of Catherine Stark. But she knew that it just couldn't happen. She couldn't be with a professor. What would happen if anyone found out? She wouldn't allow that to happen. She was so lost in her train of thought that she didn't even notice anyone standing next to her. Jackie just about had a heart attack when she saw the woman who was just previously occupying her thoughts. \"Sorry Jackie, I didn't mean to startle you. I was just over there on one of the bikes and I saw you standing over here. I hope what happened earlier didn't upset you. I truly hope I didn't scare you away.\" \"I think one of us needs to be scared, otherwise someone is going to get hurt.\" Jackie tried to say as matter of fact as she could. Catherine looked around, thankfully there weren't too many students around them. \"I would really like to continue this discussion, would you consider coming back to my place so we could talk in private?\" \"I really don't think that's a good idea.\" \"I'm going to email you my address, and I'll leave it up to you Jackie. I really would like to talk about this.\" She paused and looked Jackie deep in the eyes almost pleading with her. \"I'll think about it.\" Jackie replied and walked towards the ladies locker room. After splashing some cold water on her face and getting her water bottle from her locker she decided to head back to her dorm room. She was kicking herself for not bringing a change of clothes and now she had to walk back in sweaty gym clothes. On her walk back to her dorm she thought about what Catherine had said. Jackie had heard rumors about this teacher sleeping with other students. She certainly didn't want to be another notch on her belt, but she also felt a very strong connection to this woman and couldn't bear the thought of not being with her. When she made it back to her dorm she checked her email. Just as promised there was an email from her professor with her address as well as her cell number. She picked up her phone and starting typing a text, 'pick me up in 30 min' before she could think twice she hit send and went and hopped in the shower. Lyrics from that song she heard earlier continued to play in her head: You turn, turn, turn, turning me on Like a slow fire burn Know that it's wrong Still I run, run, run, run right into you Yeah, I run, run, run, run right into you I'm amazing when you're beside me I am so much more And I feel your fingers Pound like thunder I am so much more So much more After a fast shower and deciding what to wear she was went out to the front of the dorm where she saw Catherine waiting for her. She quietly climbed in the front seat and cautiously looked at Catherine. \"Thank you for agreeing to see me.\" Jackie just smiled as they drove the rest of the way in silence. Once getting inside of Catherine's house, Jackie was introduced to Ethan. Catherine led the way to the living room and asked if she would like a drink. \"I'll have whatever you're having, thanks.\" Jackie said as sat on the couch petting Ethan. Catherine brought over two glasses and handed one to Jackie as she sat down next to her. After sitting together for a couple minutes Catherine noticed Jackie's leg start to bounce up and down again, much like it did earlier in her office. Once again, she put her hand on Jackie's knee. \"I get it, you're nervous, but I wish you would try to relax a bit. Nothing bad is going to happen.\" \"You don't know that. What if someone finds out? I'm pretty sure the school has a 'no sleeping with student's' policy.\" \"You're right, the school does have that policy and I can't guarantee that no one will find out. But….\" She paused for a moment to brush some hair out of Jackie's face, \"…we can figure it all out.\" Catherine noticed Jackie start to relax, but just a bit. \"What? Is something else bothering you?\" Normally Jackie wasn't a blunt kind of person, maybe it was a bit of the alcohol talking, but she blurted out, \"I think I could really like you Catherine, and I've heard the rumors about you. I don't want to be another conquest to you. I'm not that kind of a person.\" Catherine slowly smiled and placed her hand on top of Jackie's. \"I think I could really like you too. And those rumors you heard? Yes, I have slept with a couple students, but it was never just some one night thing. Those all ended when it had run its course. Please believe that.\" Jackie intertwined their fingers together and looked at the woman sitting next to her as if she was trying to search her soul. She gazed at the woman until the only words she could say were, \"kiss me.\" A/N: The song is called Run by Matt Nathanson. I definitely recommend checking it out. I originally didn't plan on this one being so long, but I just didn't know how to make it shorter and still have the song in there. As always, let me know what you think. I apologize for any grammatical mistakes.[Chapter 3] A/N: As always, I don't own anything. I heard this song the other day and immediately thought of this movie. So here's the next chapter :) Catherine waited until she saw the word 'boarding' listed next to Jackie's flight before she left the airport. She hated this part. The part where she takes the person she loves to the airport and has to say goodbye, even if it is only for a short time. Luckily, Jackie was only going to be gone for about two weeks, but that thought wasn't comforting at the moment. The two loved spending time together and any time apart was always hard. Jackie had to fly back to L.A to do a couple interviews for the release of her Neptune DVD, she was hesitant at first, but her manager convinced her. Catherine didn't say much, just that she would miss her. She wanted to be supportive of her girlfriend. After their first big fight when Jackie took the movie role, they tried their best to communicate everything, even if it meant being brutally honest. Neither of them wanted another fight like the one they had early in their relationship. They had many long nights of talking about anything and everything, nights where Catherine ended up in tears because she was worried about Jackie leaving for L.A and never coming back. Nights where Jackie ended up in tears because she felt that Catherine just didn't understand the part of herself that she always left in L.A. But they always managed to work through it all and come through it stronger than ever. As Catherine started to drive away from the airport and head home, she decided to turn the radio on. Ain't no sunshine when she's gone It's not warm when she's away Ain't no sunshine when she's gone She always gone too long anytime she goes away Wonder this time where she's gone Wonder if she's gone to stay Ain't no sunshine when she's gone This house just ain't no home anytime she goes away Hey, I oughta leave the young thing alone But ain't no sunshine when she's gone Ain't no sunshine when she's gone Only darkness everyday Ain't no sunshine when she's gone This house just ain't no home Anytime she goes away She thought about all the times the two of them would be snuggled on the couch, sitting in comfortable silence. They both loved to read and would sit for hours just sipping wine and reading. Ethan had taken to Jackie right away and even he got a little sad when Jackie would leave. Catherine laughed a bit at the line, ' Hey, I oughta leave the young thing alone.' From the first time she saw Jackie in Professor Hect's office, she knew that she wanted to be with her. At first, she figured it would be just like everyone else, but after their first night together, she knew that Jackie was so different from anyone else she had ever been with. Which is why she knew that she would risk anything, including her job, to be with her. Jackie would only be gone a couple weeks, and Catherine knew that they could Skype, text and chat every day. She certainly had plenty of things to keep her busy. She was teaching a new class in the fall and she need desperately to work on her syllabus and course guide since the new semester was starting in less than a month. Before she would know it, she would be making the drive back to the airport and Jackie would fly into her arms and things would go back to normal, for a while anyway. About half way back home it started to rain. \"Ain't no sunshine sure is right\" Catherine said as she turned on her windshield wipers Let me know what you think!

Frank looked up from his seat in the back of the ambulance as the man in the brown coat approached. \"Inspector,\" he greeted him. Tarconi gave him a wry smile, handing him a steaming paper cup. \"You are happy to see me now?\" \"No, just the coffee you're holding,\" Frank replied dryly, taking the cup with a grateful nod. After nearly drowning, hours of precision driving, and several vicious hand to hand encounters, he'd been on edge for most of a day with only Valentina's descriptions of her various favorite meals to tide him over. Tarconi ignored that, eyeing Frank and his passenger with a long-suffering expression. Though not half so long-suffering as Frank knew he deserved. \"So. How long will you be requiring my hospitality this time?\" He gave his friend a half-shrug. \"Don't have any estimates yet.\" It would depend on how long it would take for his house to be repaired- but it would also depend, in part, on how the rest of the introductions went. He looked down at the bright head pillowed on his other shoulder. \"Valentina? Our ride's here.\" \"What ride?\" His former package blinked her eyes open, a vivid and arresting blue against her metallic red hair. \"Oh, your Inspector,\" she answered herself with a yawn. \"Valentina Vasileva, Inspector Tarconi. Tarconi, Valentina,\" Frank elaborated, gesturing between them. Tarconi raised his eyebrows in response. \"I see,\" he said. And he probably did; he had met Lai, and this one had thrown herself at Frank even more enthusiastically. \"Just Tarconi? No Christian name?\" Valentina asked with a sleepy frown. \"It's François, actually,\" Frank replied for his friend. \"But it would be a bit awkward if we were both called Frank. So, Tarconi.\" She giggled. \"I see,\" she echoed the inspector, glancing between them. Then she froze, lifting her head from Frank's shoulder with an air of surprised realization; she might be a spoiled debutante who'd been wasting her potential, but she was sharp enough to cut through social chaff. One of the things he liked about her. \"Wait. You said you were not the gay!\" she exclaimed. Tarconi's eyebrows raised higher at that. Frank sighed, then reached to snag Valentina's hand and draw her back close. \"I'm not,\" he replied patiently. \"...Exactly.\" \"But this friend you introduce me to! You give him look, like I have to drag you out of car and make you strip before you give to me!\" she continued indignantly. \"A striptease, Frank?\" Tarconi's mouth twitched as he eyed Frank's unusually well knotted tie. Far from taking offense, he seemed to be enjoying the conversation; definitely better than Frank deserved. \"How did that fit into your rules?\" \"Why does everyone keep harping on my rules?\" he sighed. It wasn't his fault his attempts to retire hadn't been all that successful. \"It's... complicated,\" he answered them both. Normally, that was a conversation ender; but neither of his present audience were inclined to indulge him. \"It is always complicated with you,\" Tarconi tutted. And Valentina narrowed her eyes at both of them, before ignoring him to address the inspector. \"Do you cook?\" she asked. Tarconi seemed even more amused at that; and well he might, after Lai and the way he'd introduced himself to the cops in Miami. \"I do make an excellent madeleine, if I say so myself,\" he replied. Valentina looked him over again, then nodded and settled herself back against Frank's shoulder. \"Then is not so complicated,\" she declared with an air of finality, stifling another yawn. \"I'm tired; wake me when is time to go.\" \"You see what I've had to deal with?\" Frank shook his head as he smoothed a hand over her hair. Really, who could blame him? \"Yes, I think I do,\" Tarconi replied, dryly. \"I shall leave you to deal with her father when he gets here, shall I?\" \"I suppose I have that coming.\" \"I do not know why you should think so,\" Tarconi sniffed, looking pleased with himself as he took his phone out of his pocket. \"Complicated,\" Frank repeated, shaking his head. Then he tightened his arm around Valentina and watched Tarconi direct the rest of the cleanup with a weary smile. -x- ","Summary":" Title : no straightforward fairy tale Author : Jedi Buttercup Rating : T/PG-13 Disclaimer : The wor"},{"Movie":"Transporter","Title":"Five Things That Never Happened To Frank Martin","Author":"Twig","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4533619","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Movies and characters belong to people who are not me. No copyright infringement has been intended. Rating: PG Spoilers: Mostly Transporter 1, a little for Transporter 2. Five Things That Never Happened To Frank Martin I. Never Open The Package Every now and then, Frank would find his thoughts be inexplicably drawn back to her. Sitting at a rest stop, eating a sandwich, a refreshment break in the middle of a job, and he would stare out the window at the trunk of his BMW and think of her. That girl in his trunk. Except, of course, she had long since been delivered to her destination, a job completed, money accepted and spent. She should be nothing but a distant memory. But he thought of her anyway. Wondered who she was, where she had been, where she was now. The whys and the hows, and these were things a man like him shouldn't be troubled with, shouldn't bother to think about. Granted, they were idle thoughts. He didn't lie awake at night, restless because he was bothered by what could be happening to her right now. That would imply he cared, and he didn't. He had long since made his peace with his conscience. Couldn't do his job otherwise, then or now. A soldier had no conscience, only orders; a transporter had no morals, only instructions. And yet, Frank found himself wondering just the same. Was she the kidnapped daughter of a millionaire? A high priced call girl who knew too much? The possibilities were endless. This was why he had Rule Number Three. A little curiosity was a dangerous thing. x II. No One Cared They said that at the heart of every cynic was a dreamer, and he'd laugh in the face of anyone who dared to call him a dreamer, but it wasn't like he'd enlisted all those years ago because he had wanted a gun so he could impress his girlfriend. No, he had been stupid enough to think that he could have made a difference. He'd bought the sales pitch hook, line, and sinker. The world had looked mighty different through a sniper scope, though, and it never seemed to matter what he'd done anyhow. Everything stayed the same. That was the way of the world. Newton's Laws applicable to social dynamics: things in motion tended to stay in motion. Nobody really wanted change. It wasn't profitable. And he knew all along that she was playing him, wanted to drag him into her affairs so he could solve her problems for her, but that didn't make her words any less true or stung any less deep. \"You were a soldier. Your job was to save people.\" He'd been damned since the moment he opened that bag. Just a moment of curiosity, and he shouldn't have succumbed. Once you wanted to know, then you'd start to care, and Frank Martin didn't want to give a damn. Too late for that, of course. Too late for everything. \"Kill him.\" He looked at her, then he looked down the barrel of the gun aimed at his head. He'd saved the girl, but there'd be nothing to save him. He shouldn't have cared. x III. Start Over He met her while he was on leave. She was a dainty thing in strappy heels and a short short skirt. Her dark hair gleamed in the sunlight, and he'd been caught by the shine until he realized that she was falling, and he darted forward to catch her. She smiled at him, and he remained caught ever since. She said her name was Lai, and she was a student at the local university, majoring in marketing. He didn't need to explain what he did; it was boldly stated by the uniform he was wearing. Something about the uniform, he knew, always made girls wild, but Lai? Well, she didn't like soldiers all too much, but she seemed to like him, and he counted his blessings. A week of leave passed by like mere hours. They promised to stay in touch, but in her eyes, he could see that she knew it was just the way of things if they never exchanged another word again. He was determined to prove her wrong. Military life had steadily been losing its flavour, one pointless mission after another, miscalculated targets, rescue attempts botched by political red tape. He had been content enough to stay with the life he had known, but there was another life opening up for him, and if Frank Martin was anything, he was a man who knew to take his chances when they came to him. It was worth it just to see the look on her face when he showed up at her doorstep. It was even better when she flew into his arms and clung to him. That was when he knew he'd made the right choice. x IV. No Names (Another Time, Another Place) 1.8 by 0.4 metres, 45 kilograms, 6800 kilometers, 550000 US dollars. It was a payday that he couldn't pass up, so he made the deal. Rule #1: Deals once made cannot be renegotiated. And so he was stuck, once he'd found out that his client was his package. It made his third rule rather moot, but he had been quite determined to ensure that the rest remained unthreatened. There was a reason why he had rules. They protected him, and they protected his clients. But it must have been the Brazilian sun that made everything seem more surreal, like a dream came to life, and rules were just inconveniences that could be swept aside for pleasures of the moment. He shouldn't have slept with her, even after they'd arrived in Rio de Janeiro and his job was complete. But she was blonde, she was dangerous, and she could reassemble a long range high powered rifle in under seven seconds. There was something very enticing about that. As he'd half-dozed on the bed with his cheek pressed into the pillow, she drew a fingertip down his spine and whispered into his ear, \"My name is Lola.\" She shouldn't have told him her name. Because this meant that he had something to tell, and he knows now that it's only a matter of time before the knife making its way down his chest meets something vital that he can't afford to lose. Nothing good ever comes out of breaking the rules. x V. Never Open The Package, v.2 Frank couldn't see. It was dark. It was cramped. He could hardly breathe. His mouth was taped, his hands and feet were bound. It was safe to say that he'd been kidnapped. He shifted about, and he could gather that he was in a bag of some sort; he could feel the zipper with his fingertips. There was a sense of motion. He was... in a car? A train? Difficult to tell, only that he was moving. He closed his eyes -- vision was useless anyway -- and concentrated on the sounds filtering through. Whatever was carrying him was coming to a slow stop. There was a pop, and he knew that pop. A car trunk. He was in a car trunk. Then all of a sudden, the zipper was ripped down and fresh cold air hit his face. He drew in a deep breath through his nose and blinked his eyes open, stung by the bright afternoon sun. Standing over him was an Asian woman, long hair, pouty lips, cold eyes. Beautiful, really, and young. She held up a bottle of Orangina. He stared at her. \"If you yell, I will kill you,\" she told him in heavily accented English, then she held up a knife to illustrate her threat. Frank nodded, then winced as the tape was ripped off his mouth, taking some of his stubble with it. \"What do you want? Who do you work for?\" The blade kissed his throat, and he shut up. Then she offered the lip of the bottle to his mouth. He drank, knowing that he would need to stay hydrated, and though Orangina wasn't exactly his drink of choice, he would take what he could get. His eyes remained upon her, but her expression gave nothing away. The drink was soon taken away, and she started to reseal the tape over his mouth. \"Wait!\" She paused. \"Who are you?\" Finally, her expression changed. A smile curved her lips. \"I'm the transporter.\" Then she taped his mouth, shoved his head back inside the bag, zipped it up, and slammed the trunk shut.

And if that wasn't mortifying enough, her kidnappers had stuffed her in the boot of a car! Now she needed a plan because she refused to be a victim! Annie Carlisle regained consciousness slowly. The air was stale and hot. Her hands and feet were tied and the tape over her mouth made it difficult to breathe. The low hum of a car whirred beneath her, its speed steady along a winding road that bumped and jostled just enough to exacerbate the headache hammering against the inside of her skull. Annie nearly groaned. The headache was likely a side-effect of the drug they had used to knock her out. Bastards! she thought. It was also likely she had been stuffed into the boot of a car… either that or the idiot had a broken air conditioner—damn, it was hot! But no, she couldn't hear breathing or any other tell-tale movements indicating a fellow passenger—definitely the boot. Cautious, Annie shifted slightly. Her hands were tied awkwardly behind her back and she was apparently wrapped in some sort of canvas material that scratched at her arms and face. Annie sighed in frustration. There had been a day when this situation would have been child's play: a flexible movement backward to untie her legs, another quick motion to bring her hands out in front of her, and finally the relatively easy manipulation of the boot latch and voilà ! But she was out of practice and frankly, out of shape… and her head was killing her! Bastards! she thought again. And the sudden flat tire just below her left ear was hardly alleviating her discomfort! She felt the car slow to a stop, heard the hard crunch of gravel beneath the tires and the click and thud of the driver's door opening and closing. Ha! she thought, grinning against the tape on her mouth. The spare will be in the boot! Which meant the bastard would have to move her and she would, naturally, have to make things as difficult as possible for him. Wriggling, Annie heard the boot click open and the resulting light filtered weakly through the teeth of a long zipper. She was in a duffel bag! she realized indignantly. Even more infuriating were the ill-placed hands that slid her to the back of the boot to reach the spare. \"You bastard!\" she shouted, which due to the tape still covering her lips, came out as little more than a loud, muffled noise. Fuming, Annie lay still long after the bastard had changed his tire and resumed their winding drive. When they stopped for petrol Annie was sorely tempted to press her advantage and scream, but she needed information… and her dignity. When the car slowed to a stop again soon thereafter, she wondered anxiously if she was all out of chances. The boot clicked open again, followed by the slow grate of the zipper. Annie blinked in the sudden sunlight, wanting to sigh at the welcome breath of fresh air. She scowled instead. The effect was probably ruined by the hair plastered to her face and the tape over her mouth, but she hoped her eyes at least communicated her earlier sentiments. Bastard! she thought. The bastard himself was less than extraordinary. He wore a nondescript suit with an equally boring black tie and his dark hair was cut close to his head, suggesting a military background. Though his expression was neutral, his eyes were a warm golden brown. Not a psychotic murderer, then , she reasoned fleetingly… But he still has a bagged woman in his boot! \"Hi,\" he said, his voice low and calm. Disturbingly… nonthreatening. Annie blinked and her gaze flickered to the soda bottle and straw he held in one hand before the sharp glint of a small knife in the other hand caught her undivided attention. Swallowing hard, she struggled to maintain a nonchalant expression, but her heart beat hard against her ribcage as he leaned forward. \"Now, don't move,\" he murmured, his accent distinctively English. Annie glowered at him as he brought the small blade toward her face. With a quick flick of his wrist, he cut a narrow slit in the tape across her mouth and Annie was back to blinking. A corner of his mouth twitched as he opened the soda bottle and offered her the straw. Annie's eyes narrowed. Was it drugged? Poisoned? \"Come on, drink,\" he said, voice still low and quiet. Annie raised a sardonic eyebrow. Do I look stupid to you? she thought. Then she realized she probably did. She was, after all, trussed like a holiday turkey, stuffed in a duffel bag in the boot of a car with Captain Black-Tie-Guy on an apparently secluded back road, on her way to who knew where… Yeah, definitely some stupid in there. So she went back to the scowling. Looking frustrated now, the bastard rolled his eyes and tossed the bottle aside. Careful to hide her victory grin, Annie had an idea and started to wriggle toward the lip of the boot. \"Where the hell do you think you're going?\" Annie stopped moving to glance pointedly at her mouth before looking up again. Would you like me to mumble it first , she thought derisively, or do you want to just pull this tape off and cut to the chase? The bastard stuck a patronizing finger in her face. \"If you scream, I'll have to kill you. Do you understand?\" Annie raised a defiant eyebrow in response. Rolling his eyes, he peeled back the tape over her mouth and Annie smiled. Much better! she thought. \"Well?\" he snapped. Annie frowned. \"I need a ladies room,\" she said primly. \"Shall I go here, or am I allowed a brief interlude?\" Looking irritated, the bastard considered for a moment and Annie wished she really did have to use the restroom, if only to see the look on his face when she used his boot as her facility. \"Okay,\" he said finally, pressing the tape back against her lips. Annie scowled. The entire situation was a bit surreal, truth be told. The bastard could almost be described as a gentleman were it not for the fact that she was tied up as he lifted her out of the car and well… the situation in general. Setting her feet on the ground he held her patiently as she fought for balance on unsteady legs. Of course, it didn't help that they were tied together either! Holding her upright with one hand, he pulled another rope from the boot. \"You all right?\" he asked, releasing his hold slowly. Annie would have laughed were it not for the stupid tape on her face! Instead she studied his license plate, committing it to memory, while he tied a noose at one end of the rope and slipped it loosely around her neck. Then the little knife was out again. In two quick movements the rope around her wrists and ankles fell away. Annie rubbed her wrists gratefully, reaching up to remove the blasted tape over her mouth. The bastard stopped her. \"You don't need your mouth to pee.\" Annie glowered at him. Holding the rope around her neck like a leash, he pointed to the brush behind her. \"You have one minute.\" Annie walked backward slowly, unwilling to turn her back just yet. Raising an eyebrow, the bastard checked his watch. \"Fifty-five,\" he said. \"Fifty-four.\" Smirking, Annie whirled around and into the brush. He kept the rope taut but it was easy enough to secure it around a low branch. Ripping off the tape, she made her escape, her movements quick and quiet. Just like old times , she thought. She moved carefully down a steep incline, glancing over her shoulder with a soft chuckle. When she looked forward again the bastard was waiting for her and had the audacity to look annoyed. Irritated herself, Annie took a wild swing at his head but he caught it deftly, twirling her around like a demented dance partner and tying her hands behind her back. \"No, damn y—!\" she started before he pressed the tape over her lips again. \"I hope you enjoyed your interlude ,\" he said, binding her feet again, \"'cause it's your last on this trip.\" Setting a shoulder to her midsection, he lifted her like a sack of flour. Annie was mortified! Good grief , she thought, I really am out of practice! To make herself feel better, she kneed him hard in the chest. \"Rule three,\" he grunted, maneuvering her body to lay across his shoulders. \"Never look in the package.\" Annie snorted. The trek back to his car was graciously quick, considering Annie's flagging dignity, but the two police officers circling his car were unexpected. Annie grinned behind the tape over her mouth before letting out a shrill scream. The bastard growled, flipping her off his back and into one of the cop's arms. Annie blinked, startled. Her rescuer blinked back before awkwardly setting her on her feet while his partner got the royal crap kicked out of him. Definitely military, Annie decided as she watched the bastard make quick work of her would-be rescuers. Shaking her head in annoyance, Annie didn't even put up a fight when he stuffed her back in the duffel bag in the boot, this time with two police officers. Annie sighed.

It's certainly an advantage, she supposes, having a Frenchman as her lover's lover. Whilst François doesn't live with them all the time, the days when they are together are the best ones. She bites into the cake then smiles as a cup of fresh Italian coffee is set down in front of her by Frank. Valentina didn't even notice him in the kitchen but apparently he's well ahead of them both. Dressed in a fresh suit, Frank looks impeccable (and utterly fuckable, but that's a thought she's keeping to herself) this morning. He leans back against the counter, mug in hand, and stares blankly at the door that leads to the garage. God, Valentina thinks, tilting her head and looking up at Frank from her seat at the table, if they had just thirty minutes free, she would've stripped those clothes from him and bent him over the kitchen table, but they don't. \"Morning, Frank,\" she says, vying for his attention. After the last rebuild of the house, Frank became more pedantic than ever about the details. Everything had to be in its original place, up to and including the roof line. \"Tarconi made breakfast.\" \"Mm-hmm,\" he says into his coffee mug. Frank takes a sip and pushes off the counter, snatches one of the madeleines from the pan and heads for the door. He has work today, as he has every other day, but today is different. It's not something he can quantify any more than science can, and yet it's something he trusts more than his word. \"Frank.\" Tarconi's tone is commanding and finally, finally he pays attention to them. It's the tone he uses in the bedroom too which is probably why it works so well. \"Don't you have anything to say?\" Frank pauses mid-step and lifts his mug. \"Thank you, Inspector.\" Valentina gives François a look as if to say 'I think Frank is sick.' He's acting formal again and it's weird, or rather he's acting like Frank Martin, Transporter, and not Frank Martin, boneless jelly-legged fucktoy, as he normally does in the mornings. \"As much as I would love to stay, I have to get to work too,\" François says, resigning himself to another boring day in the police force. He kisses Valentina on the cheek and hugs her then takes off after Frank to the garage. She sighs and finishes her coffee, drums her fingers on the table, and eventually realises the cars are yet to be started. That's more than a little odd given how much Frank enforces his rules. Valentina makes her way to the door of the garage and peers through the gap, notes how Frank is pressed up against the wall with his pants down around his ankles (his briefs are grey and highlight every curve of his ass), but stays on her side of the door. \"What's wrong, Frank?\" François asks, and proceeds to massage his spine with his thumb. \"You're not yourself today.\" \"It's nothing,\" Frank mutters, resting his head and arms against the wall. \"I'm fine.\" François raises an eyebrow but says nothing. He moves his hand to Frank's hip and idly strokes the exposed skin above his briefs, drawing out a low groan and a ' fuck, Tarconi ' that sounds just as needy as Frank looks. \"For once, I don't believe you.\" \"I have to get to work.\" He leans down, reaches for the hem of his pants, and promptly finds himself cornered. Valentina stands to his left with her arms crossed, and François still stands behind him. Frank fixes his pants and secures his belt then turns around. His erection is obvious and relief stands just inches away but it's not as important as the job. \"Please, can we talk about this later?\" When Valentina proposed the idea after an extensive talk with both men, of all three being involved with one another and beginning a relationship, it hadn't been just for the sex. She cared for Frank, and François, but only two of them were a little more willing to be open in every sense of the word than the third was. \"Later, then,\" Tarconi says, resigning himself to wait till tonight. He shifts his attention to Valentina, allowing Frank to walk to his car and fix the slight wrinkles in his pants. \"If he tries to leave before I come home—\" She smiles as if the Devil himself just gave her free reign over Hell. \"I'll cuff him to the bed.\" \"We will talk about whatever this is tonight, Frank, whether you like it or not.\" One of the first rules they came up with was no secrets. Honesty and a willingness to talk and be open was important. If they were to live together, both as a triangle and a family, Frank needed to stop internalising his problems, and Valentina had to let her guard down. \"See you tonight, Frank. Au revoir, Valentina.\" ","Summary":" \"Good morning, mademoiselle.\" Tarconi's in a good mood this morning, Valentina thinks as she reac"},{"Movie":"Transporter","Title":"Complications","Author":"AKA DD","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703628","Passage":"[Chapter 1] DISCLAIMER: The Transporter and Frank Martin do not belong to me. I am merely pretending to fill in the blanks. A/N: I love Frank's character, especially in the first movie. I have always wondered what had made him so stoic. Here is my attempt at filling in the blanks and making sense of why he is the way he is. Also, to explain why he had such a soft spot for the girl in the first movie. COMPLICATIONS Frank Martin lived by a set of rules. Rules were clear. Rules were rational. Rules were about knowing what was at the beginning, the middle and, definitely what was at the end. Rules meant that there would be no surprises. Rules were meant to be broken . He pitied the men who lived by that careless aphorism. Frank smirked mirthlessly, his slate gray eyes remaining cold. Not his rules. When he was doing his job, he only lived by three cardinal rules. Rule 1: NEVER CHANGE THE DEAL. When the deal is made, no detail can be altered or renegotiated—not for any price. It was a simple rule, meant to keep everything precise, preclusive, and predictable. All t's crossed, all i's dotted, all scenarios envisioned and pre-planned. All possibilities anticipated and covered. This rule kept him alive. Rule 2: NO NAMES If he didn't know, he couldn't tell. If he couldn't tell, he couldn't be indicted. End of story. There was also the matter about how knowledge had a way of complicating the simplest matters. If he didn't know, he couldn't be asked to make judgments. He was just the transporter, a middle-man hired for his skills behind the wheel. Nothing more, nothing less. Rule 3: NEVER LOOK IN THE PACKAGE Just as simple and as rational as Rule 2. All it required were cold discipline, plenty of discretion, and maybe a touch of disregard. After all, if he didn't know, there was no way he could care. Because the problem was in caring. Not many people could possibly know it, but Frank Martin cared. He cared a lot. Maybe a little too much. And that was when things got complicated—when he started to care. Then things had meaning, they had substance, they carried emotional baggage. And when that happened, lines became blurred, rules were broken, and chaos happened. And he always got hurt. Frank pressed thumb and forefinger over his closed eyelids, adding pressure until he saw a red-white flash over his lids. Then he slid the two fingers closer together until they pinched the bridge of his nose. He tried to ease away the headache that was starting to pound over his temples as memories started crowding in his consciousness. He turned to look out the window instead, to watch the waves crash onto the shore. He liked the sea despite the fact that its mercurial nature was the antithesis of his life. He liked the sea because it was easy to drown away memories in its ever-changing face. And he did not particularly like it when memories came calling back at him. \"Frank,\" The voice over the phone line was almost desperate, even through the noise of static. \"We need you to do this for us.\" \"No.\" His fingers tightened minutely around the phone, but his expression never changed as he stood staring out of his window. \"How could you just turn your back on us? We're buddies remember?\" Gray eyes narrowed as if pinpointing a small object far into the distance. \"Oh, I remember,\" he said coldly into the receiver. He remembered the explosions. He remembered how he had staggered under the dead weight of Thuy. He remembered watching from a distance as the Black Hawk hovered just over the horizon—leaving him and Thuy in the burning jungles of Vietnam. As if remembering the same memories, the voice on the other end softened. \"We were only following protocol, Frank. You know that. You were completely way out of AO. You broke formation.\" You broke the rules. The unspoken thought hung between the two Marines, the silence between them stretching taut. \"I know.\" Frank's voice was cool, soft, deceptively light. \"But my answer is still no.\" \"It was in the past, Frank. Leave it there.\" \"A past like ours… can't be left behind. You know that as well as I do.\" \"The difference is, I try to leave it behind.\" The voice on the other line was growing colder and harder. Less friendly, less camaraderie. Frank bared his teeth at the telephone, his anger showing on his face. It was all very well that the man on the other end of the telephone conversation could not see the fury on his face. \"The difference is, I try not to repeat it.\" There was a long pause, a silence filled with resentment, guilt, anger, denial and fear. \"Very well.\" The voice on the other end was curt, quickly followed by static as he hung up. Frank flipped his phone off and slipped it casually into the back of his jeans pocket. He took a deep breath and released his anger as he released that breath. He padded softly over towards his bedroom, the soft light of the coming dawn streaming from the long windows. The room was Spartan: a king-sized iron-wrought bed, a mahogany chest and a rug on the wooden floor were the only pieces of furniture in the room. His eyes were drawn towards the woman sleeping soundly, wrapped in the pillows and sheets. She was beautiful, with thick dark hair and lush lips. Her dark lashes fluttered briefly, a sign that she was waking. He came to stand before her, looming almost. His face was dispassionate. \"Wake up.\" He said flatly. Slumberous gray eyes fluttered open. She really was beautiful. And she had been fantastic company last night. Frank tightened his jaw and narrowed his eyes. \"It's time for you to go.\" Her eyes widened and she pushed herself up to a sitting position. She didn't bother to cover herself, secure in her beauty and sensuality. Frank did not aver his gaze, but neither did he allow it to roam over her soft curves. He kept his cool gray eyes on her surprised ones. \"I have work to do. You can go.\" Confusion brought a small frown to her petulant face. Then fury caused her to harden her own features as she finally understood his meaning. \"You are a bastard, Frank,\" she said scathingly, her lilting French accent adding more than enough scorn to her dark voice. \"An unfeeling, cold bastard.\" He did not reply. Instead, he reached over towards the chair where her clothes had been discarded the night before. He grabbed them and tossed them towards her. He kept his back ramrod straight as he walked to stare out the window at the crashing waves down below. He had his back to the girl as she pulled her clothes on. \"So,\" her voice was demanding, cracking like a whip. She was obviously a woman scorned. He slowly, laconically turned to face her. His face remained impassive and granite hard. He didn't bother to cross his arms over his chest. The air that surrounded him had gone chilly enough to form a wall of ice around him. She crossed her arms over her chest though, almost protectively. Her anger seemed to waver. \"So, what happens now?\" She had a low voice, made for seduction. But not this morning. Because there it was, the quiver in her voice, the sign of vulnerability and hurt. The same things that Frank was always so careful to avoid. He did not know how he had allowed things to go so far between them. They had met a week ago at the local pub. She had intrigued him, sparkling like a multi-faceted jewel among one-dimensional women. But he realized now that his interest in her was exactly the reason why she had to leave. Now. Before he knew her more. Before he became involved. Before he started to care. \"Let's not make this—\" \" Complicated? \" she filled in with scorn and hurt. Her full lips pursed. Frank steeled himself against that look on her face. The look that told him that complicated could be worth it. \"I don't particularly like complicated.\" He replied evenly. She sighed, half in disbelief, half in exasperation. She allowed her eyes to roam around the room, at the sparse, neat and ordered furnishings. Then she looked at him. His shirt was perfectly ironed, his pants had the single crease down each leg, his shoes were clean and he stood with the bearing of someone with an iron rod for a spine. She shook her head in defeat. \"Everything is always so neat with you…nothing ever out of place.\" \"I like it that way.\" His reply was curt, not really defensive, but not revealing either. It was a simple statement of a fact. \" Pourquoi? Why?\" she asked just as curtly, her French slipping in. His jaw tensed and he felt his patience suddenly seeping out. \"It's the way I am.\" He smiled mockingly, his eyes remaining blank. \"You may go.\" He was deliberately insulting her by dismissing her. He turned away from her and started to walk out of the room. \"Life isn't always so neat, Frank. It always gets complicated. It is the curse and blessing of being alive. It is called living.\" \"Not for me.\" She sighed and shook her head almost sadly. She picked up her purse from the chair where her clothes had previously hung. She walked past him, her shoulders held straight. Then, just before she stepped over the threshold of his room she turned to him. \" J'ai pitié de vous .\" With that, she left him, closing the door behind her, her footsteps echoing softly down the hall. Frank breathed out slowly, counting the seconds, controlling his emotions. She pitied him. The thought left him feeling bitter and empty. He reached for the doorknob, only then realizing that his hands were shaking. He kept hearing the rescue chopper hovering over the jungles just outside the village of Than Khe. He had her in his arms, dark hair, darker, slanted eyes, pink lips, bloodied mess, almost dead weight. He could still feel the mass of her, the way his biceps had ached, the way his lungs had heaved as he tried to make it to the LZ they had cleared off. But he had tripped. And Alpha Company had left one good soldier and one innocent girl behind to die. Frank Martin felt a chill go through him all the way to his core. She had told him to run, to leave her behind. He had not run, had not left. He had gotten involved, had cared and things had gotten way too damned complicated. And by God, he had paid the price. He couldn't even save her. No, complications were not for him. \"Not for me,\" he murmured to himself. \"Remember what comes with breaking the rules.\" Suddenly, his phone rang and he almost started, but he controlled his impulses remarkably well. Instead, he slowly reached into his pocket and retrieved it. He flicked it open and pressed the small phone to his ear. \"I need a transporter.\" No preamble was needed. It was only a business transaction after all. Frank felt a small surge of electricity run through him, as if his body were recharging itself, preparing itself to do what it did best. \"I'm listening.\" He paid attention to the details: the man's voice, his accent, the tones, the background noises, everything. \"Dimensions?\" he queried quietly. He mentally took note of the answer, filing it away for future reference. \"Weight?\" he prodded. Then after a pause, \"Be precise.\" He asked for pick-up and destination. He named his price. And finally, \"I only have three rules…\" END ","Summary":" DISCLAIMER: The Transporter and Frank Martin do not belong to me.

Frank Martin rested his forearms against the white marble as the hot water beat down on his shoulder blades. It was well past two in the morning. The luxury hotel room he and Valentina were staying in was too extravagant for his taste but her father had insisted. The best Odessa had to then Frank had been far too tired to refuse. The hot water stung the cuts and bruises but Frank barely noticed. It was nothing new to him. Though he was always amazed at what hot water and steam could do to the human body. Half an hour in his muscles were starting to ease but not the tension. The adrenaline had long since worn off but his mind was still racing. Still back at the train. Frank sighed and straightened turning his face to face the stream of water. It'd been a long time since he'd felt the fear he'd felt on that train. Not for himself but for her. He knew now as he had then that he would've sacrificed everything in a heartbeat if it had meant Valentina would live a long happy life. Complication. His life wasn't one for complications. His life wasn't one to share. Too many dangers. Too many people that would see her as a way to hurt him. That was one thing Frank didn't want to see again. Seeing her crumpled on the floor of the train buried under debris had made his heart stop. For a second a very long second Frank thought Valentina was dead. That had brought up feelings he hadn't wanted to acknowledge. Tarconi had teased him saying he was a romantic. Frank shook his head as he reached for the gold plated faucet to turn off the water. Maybe the inspector was right. Frank had his share of women over the years. Some he had even thought he'd loved. That was until Valentina had broken down his barriers. Frank stepped out of the shower and grabbed a plush white towel and began to wipe away the water. She deserved better than him. She deserved stability. A house, a family. Things Frank wasn't sure he could ever give. At the last thought Frank shook his head. There it was again….complication…..thoughts of the future. Frank finished drying off and pulled on a white t-shirt and a pair of dark blue boxers. He padded quietly back into the bedroom. He leaned back against the wall by the bathroom watching Valentina sleep. The moonlight making the fresh bruises stark against her skin and the white sheets. Another reminder of how close they'd been to death. Too damn close. Frank pushed himself away from the wall and crawled back into bed pulling the blankets up around him. Valentina stirred in her sleep at the movement but didn't wake. Frank smiled and pulled her close resting his head against the pillow. Tenderly he brushed a stray red hair away from her face before he closed his eyes. Maybe just maybe it was time to think about changing some of his rules. end ","Summary":" Title: Complication Author: Cindy Ryan Spoilers: Transporter 3 Category: Missing scene,one shot Sum"},{"Movie":"Transporter","Title":"All the Great Things are Simple","Author":"Aoife129","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4278782","Passage":"[Chapter 1] All the Great Things are Simple She read the slip of paper again and hoped it was the correct address. Otherwise, she'd have come all this way for nothing--not to mention the fact that she would have to start all over again. It had been hard enough just to get this address. One deep breath and two vertical steps forward, and her outstretched fist hesitantly knocked four times on the large brown door. Her hands shook as she waited for the tenant to answer. When the door finally opened, it sent a wave of calm through her; there stood exactly the man she was seeking. \"Hey, Frank. Yer a hard man ta get a hold of these days.\" \"Can I help you?\" There was a slight recognition in his gaze. I know those eyes . It was dark out, but in the porch light, he clearly saw the deep blue-gray colored irises, and the pupils circled by a line of brown. \"Has it really been that long?\" She sighed and uttered a phrase that would either spark his memory or confuse the hell out of him. \"Five points; I've flushed your tie down the toilet, and I've puked on your bed, but never blatantly disobeyed you.\" It worked; his hazel eyes glowed. \"Ollie?\" She smiled in return. \"Is that really you? God, you got tall.\" \"Tall? I'm only five foot two!\" \"Well, the last time I saw ya, you were two foot five,\" he countered. A gross understatement, but his point had been made. \"Fair enough,\" she laughed. \"Come 'ere.\" He didn't have to pick her up or kneel to hug her anymore. When he let her go again, he took a step outside and pulled the door shut. \"So, whatcha doin' here?\" It wasn't an accusation. \"Um.\" This was going to be hard. She'd temporarily allowed the bad news she carried to escape her as she'd filled her mind with only thoughts of seeing Frank again. \"Ya haven't been returnin' m' letters fer about three months now. But I figg'red ya'd wanna know that Ma died a few weeks past.\" \"Oh, Sweetheart.\" He opened the door again and laid a hand on her back. \"Come on inside.\" She stepped through the doorway and, his hand still on her back, Frank led her into the kitchen. There was another man sitting at the table sipping from a coffee mug. \"Ollie, this is Inspector Tarconi. Inspector, this is Ollie.\" He pulled out a chair for her, then grabbed a mug and began pouring coffee into it. She dropped her messenger bag onto the floor next to the chair and sat. \"Uli, was it?\" \"Ollie,\" she corrected politely. \"Olivia Leigh . . . Ollie to friends and family.\" Inadvertently, her eyes shot to Frank. \"You are a friend of Monsignor Frank?\" Wow, Tarconi, way to be clever. \"Somethin' like that, yeah.\" \"Milk 'n sugar; right, Love?\" Frank asked from across the room. \"Aye,\" she answered with a half smile. He tilted the milk bottle, allowing a small amount to lighten the dark liquid filling the mug. Then he dropped in a teaspoonful of white sugar from a small dish and began stirring it. \"Your accent,\" Tarconi observed, \"is not French, not English . . .\" \"No,\" she clarified. \"Technically, I was born in England, but Ma 'n I moved ta Ireland when I's four.\" She paused slightly and looked to Frank when she said \"four\" as though she were not really sure. \"Five.\" Frank amended. \"So, then what brings you all the way to France?\" Ollie went quiet for a second. Like times past, Frank was there to save her. He set the mug on the table before her. \"Ollie's mum died not too long ago.\" He kissed the top of her head, then sat next to her and began drinking from his own mug. \"Oh, I am sorry to hear that.\" She dropped her chin in a grateful nod. \"Ya want anythin' ta eat, Sweetheart?\" Frank asked. She'd been in the house four minutes, and already he was worried about her. \"Nah, thanks. I--uh--I grabbed a sandwich at one 'a the cafés in town.\" \"When did you get in?\" \"Well, the plane landed two days ago. But like I said, you're a hard man ta get a hold of.\" \"You've been wanderin' Marseilles for two days?\" \"It's not exactly easy ta find ya when yer not in the phone book, y'know. And on top 'a that, ya tend ta keep a low profile, so not many people know who ya are.\" She seemed exhausted just thinking about the process she'd gone through. Despite the coffee, Ollie felt her eyes drooping. It had been a long couple of days, and she hadn't slept since she'd gotten off the plane. She didn't really have the money for a hotel room; she didn't feel safe anywhere anyway. \"Are you alright, Love?\" \"Just tired,\" she sighed. Frank's lips pursed briefly. Then he stood and lightly touched her cheek. With a soft CLINK his mug found a new home in the sink, and he headed through the doorway. \"Mademoiselle Olivia,\" Tarconi ventured. \"Yes, Inspector?\" Ollie shook her head a bit an blinked, willing the drowsiness to leave her alone. \"Would you mind if I asked how your mother died?\" \"Car accident.\" A slight laugh escaped her closed mouth, but it was devoid of happiness. Ironic , Tarconi thought. She must think it as well . Frank returned from the other room. He gently laid a hand on her shoulder and took her mug from her. \"Come on, Little One; time for bed.\" She knew enough not to oppose him. She stood, but had to grab onto his outstretched arm to steady herself; her legs were tired of holding her up. Her mug joined Frank's, and he led her into his bedroom, sitting her down on the bed. Her shoes came off first; she didn't resist that. Then came the hair tie, letting down her ponytail. But she objected when he tried to pull her shirt over her head. \"I'm grown up now.\" He knelt to look her in the eyes. \"Number one, you don't have anything I haven't seen before. And number two, the fact that you've grown isn't gonna make me think of you as anything but that bubbly little blond I used to throw in the air.\" She gave in, sitting in her bra as he grabbed a T-shirt from his drawer and pulled it over her head. He offered her his hands, and she stood long enough to undo her fly and step out of her jeans; the T-shirt was plenty long enough, but he gave her a clean pair of boxers to wear as well. Then she collapsed onto the bed, and he pulled the blanket over her. She rolled onto her side facing him. Bending down, he kissed her temple. \"Say it.\" Her voice was barely a whisper. \"Aren't you a little old for that?\" \"Please?\" With a sigh, he sat on the edge of the bed and pushed her hair back behind her ear. Obediently, he began reciting: Winken, Blinken and Nodd one night Sailed off in a wooden shoe-- Sailed off on a river of crystal light Into a sea of dew \"Where are you going, and what do you wish?\" The old moon asked the three \"We have come to fish for the herring fish That live in the beautiful sea Nets of silver and gold have we Said Winken, Blinken, and Nod The old moon laughed and sang a song As they rocked in the wooden shoe And the wind that sped them all night long Ruffled the waves of dew The little stars were the herring fish That lived in the beautiful sea \"Now cast your nets wherever you wish Never afeared are we\" So cried the stars to the fisherman three Winken, Blinken, and Nod He didn't make it all the way through the poem; she was already asleep. He stood, pulled the blanket up a little higher, then turned off the lamp on the nightstand. \"Goodnight, Love.\" As he walked back out to the kitchen, Tarconi was pulling on his coat. \"Leaving already, Inspector?\" \"Well, you know, it's almost eleven, and I have work in the morning,\" he shrugged. \"We old men need our sleep.\" One side of Frank's mouth curled up, a knowing glance passing between them. He knew exactly what Tarconi was going to do, and it wasn't sleep. He nodded and held out his hand. \"I will see you again soon, my friend.\" \"You're always welcome here,\" Frank affirmed. He walked Tarconi to the door. One step outside, the inspector turned. \"I've never seen you act toward any other person like that before.\" \"She's not just any other person.\" \"I'm seeing that,\" he admitted. \"But I'm just wondering who she is to you.\" \"Ollie is the one complication in my life that was never complicated.\" As always, Frank, never saying more than you have to . Tarconi nodded, accepting the answer for the time being. \"Well, goodnight, Monsieur Frank.\" \"Goodnight, Inspector.\" -- Light assailed her eyes as she rolled over and buried her face in the pillow. She heard the door creak open and knew without looking that Frank leaned against the doorjamb looking at her, just as he knew she was really awake despite her best efforts to remain otherwise. \"Five points,\" he started. \"I'm not quite round, but my casing is sound, unless I happen to fall.\" She sat up and faced him, brightening instantly. \"You made breakfast.\" He smiled as she bounced out of bed. Grabbing her hair tie off the nightstand, she shuffled through the doorway, briefly stopping to kiss him on her way past to the kitchen. \"Good morning,\" she called over her shoulder. They sat together eating eggs and toast in near silence. Frank couldn't help but smile a little. He liked it quiet in the mornings; it let him think whatever he wanted to without being called to share. That was one of the things he'd never had to scold Ollie for. Maybe she understood, or maybe he just scared the speech out of her sometimes . . . But something told him it wasn't the latter. Frank may not have been a master chef, but he knew exactly how Ollie liked her eggs prepared. She poked one of the orange bubbles, spilling yolk all over the small plate. With one piece of the toast, she sopped up most of it. Suspecting she hadn't eaten properly in a while, Frank had made her three eggs cooked somewhere between was was considered \"over easy\" and \"over medium.\" He'd also used a good portion of the loaf of bread that had been delivered that morning, lightly glazing each slice with butter and crisping it in the pan. The slices now sat on a plate between them, and she ate almost half of what was there, as well as all three eggs. \"How's school?\" he finally asked. \"I finished six months ago,\" she answered through a bite of bread. \"Really?\" \"Bachellor of Science in Genetics. Ma didn't want want me leavin' the house fer college, so I took classes online.\" \"Why not?\" Even through all the moves, Ollie had been in public school all her life. \"Don't know,\" the girl admitted. \"Just said she switched jobs and wanted ta spend more time with me.\" He noted how already, the girl was slipping back into her British accent a bit, no doubt by accident. It hadn't been long after the girls had moved to Ireland that he almost didn't recognize her voice on the phone because of the accent switch. Ollie was just an excellent mimic, and her voice would naturally adopt the speech pattern of the people she was most around. What he always found funny was that this talent allowed her to do perfect accents on command, but when she was speaking plainly, the change in speech was always unintentional. From his left pocket, Frank's phone began to chirp. He pulled it out, flipped it open and said, \"Hello?\" Ollie couldn't hear the person on the other end, but she knew exactly what was going on when Frank answered, \"I'm listening.\" Besides the signal phrase, Ollie could always tell when someone had called Frank to transport; his eyes would go cold and his body rigid. It was like every muscle in his body was holding its breath. She looked at him with curiosity. He placed his hand over the receiver for a second and commanded, \"Drink your juice,\" then stepped out of the room to discuss the details of the job. She made a face at him that he didn't see. She hated orange juice; at least this kind didn't have pulp. When he came back, she asked, \"Was that for today? Or later in the week?\" She may not have been very old when he had originally given up transporting and become a soldier, but she'd known he drove people and things around, and that she wasn't supposed to talk to police officers unless she was in trouble. After the military, Frank had continued to write letters to her--this time accepting her return correspondence at a post office box--in which he told her he was \"a delivery man.\" As he opened his mouth to answer, the phone began singing again. He shut his jaw with a sigh and held up a finger as he snapped the phone open again and answered, \"Hello?\" For this conversation, he stayed where he was; this wasn't a job. \"Yeah . . . I don't see why not . . . yeah, she'd probably just get bored sitting around here all day . . . I'm sure she wouldn't mind.\" Ollie's ears were about to spontaneously combust, but she showed no sign. She gulped down the rest of her orange juice trying not to taste it while Frank finished the mysterious phone call in front of her. \"Yeah, we'll see you in a bit then . . . Goodbye.\" The phone returned to his pocket, and he started cleaning up the dishes. \"Where are we going today?\" \"Inspector Tarconi wants to talk to you a bit today; so on my way to work, I'm gonna drop you off at the station.\" \"I see; don't want me digging out any old photographs or anythin' while yer gone?\" \"Actually, most of those were destroyed in the fire.\" He seemed so matter-of-fact about it. \"Fire?\" \"Yeah, I got into some trouble a while back, and someone ended up burning my house down. That's why I went to Miami for a little while, and came back here when I figured it was safe again.\" He didn't deliberately hide what he did from Ollie; he just tended not to give too many specifics because if she didn't know, she didn't have to lie. But if he refused to tell her anything, she'd find out on her own. \"Did you break the rules?\" He cocked his head to the side and his eyebrow rose. \"You did, didn't you?\" she smiled. \"Go get dressed.\" She let it drop. Frank was a man who lived by rules; he had a set of rules for everything. She'd grown up knowing that. Rules made sure things ran smoothly; they made sure no one got hurt. She hopped up from her chair, dropped her dishes in the sink, then grabbed her messenger bag, still sitting next to the table, and headed back into the bedroom. A few minutes later, they were heading out toward the garage. \"Do you remember the rules of the car?\" She was shocked he would even ask her. Frank took a few steps before realizing she was no longer at his side. She'd stopped short almost as soon as the words had left his mouth. He turned to find her with her jaw set and her eyebrow toward the ceiling. \"Alright, I'm just checkin'.\" She caught up to him and together they walked through the door that led to Frank's car. Ollie opened the passenger side door and slid in, making sure her feet didn't touch anything but the floor mat. Frank entered the driver's side in a similar manner and touched a button. A small screen popped up, prompting him to punch in the ignition code. Before he could, Ollie reached out and hit 1-9-8-6. He turned toward her, surprised for a second, then he returned to starting the car. \"What?\" she asked. \"It's not my fault ya still use the year I's born as yer ignition code.\" -- The shiny black car pulled up in front of the police station. Inside, Frank pulled a wad of money from his wallet and handed it to Ollie. \"What's this for?\" \"It's gonna be a little while before we'll be able ta get back to the house in Ireland ta get your things, and you're gonna need some new clothes soon; ya can't keep wearin' the same three shirts all the time.\" \"Thanks.\" \"As soon as ya go in, there'll be a desk; just tell the lady you're here ta see Tarconi, and she'll tell ya where ta go.\" She nodded that she understood. \"I'll pick you back up here at four.\" He opened the glove box and handed her one of the cell phones from inside. \"For emergencies; the only people who have this number are me and Tarconi. If you can help it, don't go anywhere that's not heavily populated.\" \"I know, Da.\" \"I just want ya ta be safe.\" \"Take yer own advice; no more breaking the rules.\" Her voice commanded it, but her eyes begged. \"I don't think I could handle losing you as well.\" They sat looking at each other for a few seconds. \"Alright, I'm gonna be late.\" He wasn't pushing her, but he was suggesting that she couldn't come on this job. \"What time am I picking you up?\" \"Four.\" She pulled on the door handle and put a foot on the pavement. \"Hey,\" Frank objected. She stopped, pushed herself back in the car, and kissed him before moving to get out again. \"Love you,\" he called after her. \"Love you too.\" Ollie closed the door and stood waving as he pulled away. Then she turned around, took a deep breath, and plunged into enemy territory. As she walked up to the secretary's desk, the woman rattled off something in French. \"Um . . . I'm here to see Inspector Tarconi,\" she returned hesitantly. \"Oui, Mademoiselle Olivia?\" \"Yes.\" \"Down zis hall, you will see his name on ze door. He should be in his office.\" \"Thank you.\" The young woman nodded and went back to answering the phones as Ollie started down the hallway. Unconsciously, she counted her steps as she walked. At step fourteen, she stopped in front of a door labeled--among other names--\"Inspector H. A. Tarconi.\" She knocked a couple of times and was invited to enter. \"Ah, Mademoiselle Olivia.\" \"Inspector.\" She dipped her chin respectfully. \"Please, have a seat.\" She sat and made herself comfortable in the chair he indicated; she had a feeling she would be here for a while. \"If you don't mind, I would like to ask you a few questions.\" \"You've been looking up my records, haven't you?\" \"Did Monsieur Frank tell you that?\" \"No, but he did raise me.\" He nodded defeat. \"You were not easy to find. I tried to do a search on only your first and middle names and couldn't find anything substantial. Then, on a hunch, I added Frank's last name and finally found you. But it is strange that through years of searching Monsieur Frank's files, I have never once seen mention of you or your mother.\" Ollie looked unsurprised. \"Which brings me to my first question; your name is Olivia Leigh Martin.\" After a brief silence, she responded, \"That was a question?\" He didn't answer; he simply looked at her as though she should understand. \"Yes, that is my full name.\" \"And Monsieur Frank is listed as your father on your birth certificate?\" This time she caught the slight raise of his voice on the last word. \"Frank William Martin is, yes.\" \"But your mother's name is Emma Katherine Jones?\" \"Yes.\" She was failing to see the point. \"They were never married?\" \"No.\" She paused for a moment and then explained, \"It would make sense if you understood the circumstances surrounding my conception.\" \"Would you mind telling me a little?\" \"Is there a reason you need to know?\" He nodded, understanding. \"As Frank's daughter, you've been told to be wary of police, no?\" \"Very astute, Inspector.\" \"Well, I can assure you, Mademoiselle Olivia, there have been plenty of times I could have arrested Monsieur Frank, but I do not. Do you know why?\" \"Why?\" \"Because I know much of his past, and I know his character. These things tell me that he is a good man. And I have much more important things to do than chase after good men.\" She allowed the corner of her mouth to turn upward. The men had obviously been visiting as friends when she'd first arrived, which meant--at least to a degree--that Frank trusted him; she would trust him too. \"Frank and my mother were very good friends through school. Never thought about dating, but trusted each other with everything. My ma was seein' a guy who was a real jerk, treated her horribly. One day, he and Frank got into a fight that ended with Ma breakin' up with the guy.\" \"Of course.\" It was a natural interjection, and not one of interruption. \"Naturally, Ma was feelin' pretty crappy that night, so she 'n Frank went to a party some friends were havin'. The two of 'em got pretty drunk 'n ended up in bed ta-gether.\" She paused for a second, looking down and gathering herself before continuing. \"Then they sobered up a bit and were gettin' ready to leave. Ma went to the bathroom, and while she was there, she was raped.\" She laughed a little nervously. \"Talk about a bad day.\" Tarconi's brow was furrowed with concern. \"You know the kind of man Frank is.\" Tarconi nodded. \"They were never more than friends, but he was there through the pregnancy, and fer m' birth. And without knowing which of the three was my biological father, and without hesitation, Frank signed my birth certificate. Now, I don't know about you, Inspector, but I believe it takes a very strong man to claim a child that might not be his.\" \"Indeed it does.\" Tarconi mirrored the girl's half smile, finally understanding what Frank had said earlier.

Frank Martin receives a mysterious phone call and although he doesn't want the details, the details are given to him anyway. The package in question is one that he should have said no to. However, before he could reply, the phone call ended, leaving him with only the pick up address and the destination. Lying in his row boat with the absence of company, Frank Martin, Ex Special Force Operator, enjoyed the French sun bathing him in comfortable warmth. Life was quiet, but that was the way he liked it. There was no fuss, and no fuss meant no unnecessary hassle. However, it was when the phone call came did the intrusion upon his quite life begin and Frank Martin found himself dressed in what he deemed as his 'work clothes' and driving his car to the 'pick up point'. His latest employer did not introduce himself, merely stated what was required of him, what the package was and where it was to be delivered to. The offer was 1. Not 1 hundred, not 1 thousand or hundred thousand, but 1 million dollars, an offer that the employer knew, was far too tempting to reject. As he arrived at the 'pick up point' Frank Martin looked around for the so called package. The road had led him to the middle of no where, trees lining the path he had driven along. The coordinates he had keyed into the navigation system had shown that he had arrived. So…why was there nobody there? The sound of a metal chain against tree caught his attention and he turned his eyes towards the sound, squinting beyond the quintessential line of trees. The package was in a form of a woman. He had known that, but the surprise that came with the image, Frank Martin was unable to contain. She was stunning. Her long wavy black hair cascaded down around her shoulders, framing her small but well proportioned face. Her eyes were wide and golden brown, her nose was small and her lips were full and luscious. The Asian girl's wrist was chained to the tree and she slumped against in it resolute defeat. The key had been set mockingly just out of her reach, but in plain view. After watching the girl, or the so called package for a further minute, he slid out of the car and strode up to her, listening to the gravel crunch under his feet. His shadow caught her attention and the girl looked up to him before scrambling back as far away as possible; a vain attempt, a last attempt at defiance. They both knew that he could easily overpower her. \"Huh.\" Frank Martin said as he picked up the silver key coated with dirt. He turned back to the girl; her wrist was red from where she had tried to pull free of the cuff. Wordlessly, he bent down and unlocked the silver metal that trapped her to the door. The girl stood immediately and ran, but to her disappointment, stumbled and fell. Frank Martin took his time in getting to her and pulling her to her feet. The girl, clearly weak from hunger and exhaustion, slumped forward and Frank had to catch her again. Geez, what is this? He thought to himself and sighed and he bundled the girl neatly into the passenger seat. She turned to him, glared at him with angry, unruly eyes before turning away, curling up and falling into a restless sleep, lips occasionally trembling from some unseen fear. Frank Martin looked at the girl one last time and veered the car smoothly back onto the road before heading to the destination where she was to be delivered. Indeed, he was curious as to why she was the package in the first place; but Frank knew better than to ask questions. Questions always led to trouble.

My name is Dr. Serpico and I'm here to present you my second story on ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding'' Here´s the thing, since the movie is a comedy movie, i decided to write something different and put a bit of a tragedy into the story.

I hope you like it and give some feedbacks, so i will be able to know how I'm doing. Thanks for the collaboration Dr. Serpico CHAPTER 1 – A NIGHT OF PASSIONS AND NIGHTMARES It happened a few days after Maria and Gus wedding and peace seemed to be restored at the family once again, once the old couple had stop bickering each other. Even Zorba´s, seemed to have increase the costumers and it´s sells. Everyone was celebrating. That night, once everything was settled and Paris was preparing herself to go to New York, Ian and Toula finally decided to have a real date as a newly wedded couple, so they asked their daughter if she could spend the night at her paternal grandparents, so her parents could have the house all to themselves and her maternal grandparents could enjoy the quietly of a honeymoon by themselves as well. This way, Ian took his wife to the same where they had their first date and it was awesome, they talk and laugh and remembered all they had to endure in order to finally join in matrimony. Once the dinner ending and they get to the car, Ian lean over Toula, not noticing her massages her own chest and whispered in her ear. ''How about we finish this in home?'' he said and she kissed him passionately agreeing with the idea ''we better get home soon then, I'm anxious to see you in your new pajamas'' ''Stop this'' she said, smacking his arm gently, but ignoring the uncomfortable sensation in her own arm ''you are making me very excited'' she said as they burst out laughing and Ian drove back home. _/_ They barely closed the front door of their house and started kissing each other, repeating over and over ''I love you'' and eventually ran upstairs to their room, already half clothed, with their lips stuck. Once there, they jump on the bed, ready for a wonderful nigh between hugs and kisses, when suddenly, out of nowhere, Toula gasped and fallen on top of her husband, almost hitting him on the nose. It took Ian a minute to realize she had fainted, at first, he got a bit upset, since she could have hurt him, still, when she doesn´t moved, he pushed her gently aside and turn her on her back, just to notice that her lips had starting to get a slight shade of blue. ''oh God!'' he exclaimed, panic washing over him ''honey? Toula, it´s not funny'' he said, checking her pulse and finding a faint heartbeat. Trying to stay calm, Ian dresses her on a robe, while calling for an emergency and dressing himself on the first cloths he found wile praying for a miracle to happen. _/_ At their house, Gus and Maria were just lying on their bed, watching a movie, while making their own version of honeymoon, when suddenly; the sound of a siren startled them. Immediately, the old couple holds into each other scared, when Gus shallowed hard and approached the window ''what an ambulance is doing at Toula and Ian´s house?'' he asked confused ''an ambulance?'' Maria rushed to the window and looked at her daughter´s house, when the telephone ringed ''Nicko, what is it?'' Gus growled to his son who had called them ''Dad, you and Ma, come outside, something happened at Toula´s house'' he said ''oh God!'' Maria placed a hand on her chest, scared and they rushed to the street. ''I hope the ambulance had mistaken the address'' Maria said, trying not to think the worse. _/_ As they approached the Miller´s house, Maria gasped in horror at the sight of her younger daughter been lowered at the back of the vehicle and quickly rushed to her side, placing a hand on Toula´s head. ''Ma´am, you need to step back'' the paramedic said ''Mamá, come here'' Nick and Athena approached their parents, to give them support ''Ian, what is going on?'' someone asked, as a very pale Ian step out of the house, followed by another paramedic ''can´t explain now'' he said ''what you mean you can´t explain? What happened to my daughter?'' Gus was very angry ''that´s okay Dad'' Nick interrupted him ''Ian, what hospital you´re going?'' ''Mercy´s'' ''we meet you there then, I will going take the car'' the Greek man said ''I think that the non-Greek husband killed the weird wife'' one neighbor whispered to the other, as they watch the Ambulance drama. ''You know, could you give yourself some respect, before I call the police? Get out of my sister´s yard'' Athena barked at the three annoying women standing there. _/_ The whole family except for Paris joined Ian at the hospital a few minutes later and he finally managed to tell everyone what happened. Apparently, the adrenaline or excitation during the night time, had caused Toula a heart attack and now the doctors was examining her, to know the extension of the damage. ''oh, that´s okay, she´s going to be fine'' Aunt Voula tried to cheer Ian up ''after my wedding night, I woke up in a pool of blood, so Taki brought me to the hospital and everything work well'' she smiled. ''someone has told Paris what happened?'' it was Uncle Taki who asked ''no, I thought about calling her, but It´s better wait and make sure her mother is okay'' Ian said as a doctor come out of a room. ''Family of Fortoula Miller?'' he asked and the whole family approached ''I'm her husband, Ian Miller'' the tall man said almost in panic ''how is she doing?'' ''Mr. Miller, I'm afraid I don´t have good news.'' Dr. Turner started ''your wife is alive, but the cause of her heart attack was much worse than I thought.'' ''what you mean?'' Ian was trying to hold back tears. ''We still have a few tests to do, but everything points that your wife have a congenital heart disease. You know if someone in the family have history of heart problem?'' Dr. Turner asked and in response Gus stand up ''Costa, what you´re doing?'' Maria looked at her husband ''my grandmother in Greece had died of a heart attack'' he said, all color had drawn from his face. ''I see…'' Dr. Turner noted down something ''Mr. Miller, Mrs. Miller will have to undergo surgery so we can install a peacemaker…'' ''my poor little girl'' Maria started to cry ''shhh, keep quiet, let the doctor continue'' her husband tried to calm her down ''…still, it´s more likely she will need to receive a new heart and...'' Dr. Turner tried to continue ''if there's the problem, then give another heart to her'' Gus decided. ''it´s not that simple Sir, we need to find out what type of blood match with Mrs. Miller, the surgery itself could increase some risks, besides, she doesn't have much time'' the doctor finished and for the first time, no one knows how to argue back.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2 – OUR BIG FAT GREEK LIFE Paris only knew what happened to her mother next day in the morning, when her dad gone to pick her up from his parent´s house. Sure, someone from the Portokalo family offered to go pick her up, but Ian told them it was the best if he told his daughter in person what happened to Toula. Needless to say that Paris freaked out when Ian finish telling her and as the tall man wrapped her in his arms, she cried herder, telling it was her fault her mother has the attack. \"Your mom's going to be fine.\" He said pulling her close and placing his head on top of hers. \"We just need to keep her in our thoughts. Don´t say it is your fault because it isn´t honey\" Paris nodded still crying ''now let´s go see her, Dr. Turner said she will woke up anytime soon. _/_ Indeed Toula was just woke up from the anesthesia when Paris and Ian got back to her ICU room and the teen had to hold herself back to not jump on her mother's lap, but even so, they held each other, happy that things hadn't gone a different darker way. The teenage hardly left her mother's side the entire time she was there in the hospital and even when the woman got back home a week later, the teen always keep close, helping her dad and another family member, taking care of her mom. _/_ ''mom, you give everyone a scare huh?'' Paris told her mother one day as they folded some laundry, ignoring Doctor´s orders ''yeah, I'm sorry for that honey. But I'm fine now, don´t worry'' Toula kissed her daughter´s head ''you know what Theia Voula said about it?'' Paris shook her head negativity ''well, she said it happened because I was out of shape… if your father and I could do it more regularly…'' \"mom!'' Pairs exclaimed covering her ears. \"I really don't need to hear this\" \"Okay. I'll stop.\" Toula smiled and set on the couch ''mom, you´re alright?'' ''yeah, just a bit tired, I will take a nap, ok?'' the mother said resting her head on the pillow \"Okay, you need anything?\" Paris asked and Toula shook her head softly. \"I'm okay for now. Why don´t you go to your grandparents? See if they need anything\" Paris nodded and kissed her mom's forehead before take the kays and walk out of the house. _/_ Half of the entire family was there crammed inside the small house, helping Maria with the food, when Paris came inside, quietly. ''Paris, where were you have been?'' Maria asked '' you were not alone with that boy, were you?'' ''who? Bennett? He´s my boyfriend'' Paris twinkled her nose '' Well, anyway, you know what to do ...'' Maria was starting to say something, but Paris interrupted her ''I was with mom, Yja-yja, but she got tired and went for a nap, so I decided to come here. Need some help?'' she asked, when the door opened and Voula come in, caring a bag ''Maria, here are the peppers you asked for. How are the preparations? Paris, honey, it's good that you're here, you can help me with separating the spices.'' ''okay'' the girl said, but Maria stopped her ''no, girls who are dating, should not fiddle with spices, especially peppers, bad luck on the wedding day'' she said ''it´s the advice I give to your mother, when she was about to merry'' ''Yja-yja… about mom, I'm kind of worry about her…'' ''honey, we came from a long line of strong women. So the worry is not needed. Now, let me go make you something to eat. You look like you haven't been eating well.\" \"Your grandma's right.\" Aunt Voula said appearing and wrapping an arm gently around her shoulders. \"Even if they can't find a new heart quickly, your mother is the most stubborn woman I know. She'll fight until the cows come home ''yeah, right'' the girl blushed and mentally thanked the older woman for not making any sex comment. After lunch, Paris wanders back into the sitting room only to find her Pappou sitting and staring at a computer screen. \"Pappou, what are you doing?\" Paris asked standing next to him. \"Is your hip hurting you again?\" \"No,\" He lifted his eyes looking through his glasses as they were perched on the edge of his nose. \"Trying to set up a Facebook page.\" \"Why?\" Paris asked trying not to laugh at her grandfather's expense. \"Because your Yja Yja said I'm too old to have one. Want to help me?\" \" okay…'' the girl set beside the older man and opened the Facebook page, when he looked at her and point a finger. ''you know, Alexander the Great, was the first person in the world, to have a heart transplant?'' Gus told her and in response, Paris just raised her eyebrow, confused ''sure?'' ''the word heart transplant' came from the Greek word ' kardio metamóschefsi' which means heart metamorphoses, so, a transplant is change a heart from another. There you go!'' hearing that, Paris just shook her head and started the hard challenge of teaching her grandfather how to use Facebook. _/_ Back at her house, Toula woke up with someone knocking the front door. Confused, the Greek woman rose from the couch and went to open the door, only to come face to face with her two siblings. ''hey, what you guys are doing here?'' she asked confused ''well, Paris is at Ma and Dad and as I assumed Ian hadn´t cook anything, we decided to brought you something to eat.'' Athena said ''thanks'' the other sister smiled ''er… Ian doesn´t know how to cook and you guys know I can´t eat food with much fat, don´t you?'' ''oh, don´t worry, Illyria made you her special pork soup'' Nick said, giving his sister a kiss. Despite of always arguing with each other when they were young, Toula actually enjoyed spend the afternoon with her siblings, as they talked about their childhoods, remembering the past and talking about the future. ''you remember when Dad insisted that Kimono, was a Greek word?'' Athena laugh ''yeah, that´s it´s came from ''Chimoneas'' which is winter'' Toula replies ''poor dad'' Nico couldn´t help but laugh, as the three of them finish the soup ''well, the conversation is good, but I need to get the kids from school'' the older sister said getting up and giving her younger sister a kiss on her cheeks ''take care of yourself and take your medicines. Ian and Paris can eat the rest of the soup'' ''see you at dinner Sis'' the man give her a hug ''Dinner?'' Toula blinked in response ''Don´t tell me you forget Angelo´s birthday?'' Athena give her a scold ''tonight we will have a big dinner at Ma and Dad´s'' ''Oh, ok. Sorry'' Toula apologized, opening the door to her siblings, just to came face to face with their grandmother. '' Mana-Yiayia? What are you doing here?'' Toula asked, however, instead of answering, the older woman, just approached her granddaughter and place a hand above her heart and smiled sadly ''okay… that´s weird'' ''I always knew she was crazy'' Nick whispered, sadly loud enough to his sisters hear and slap him in response ''okay, Mana-Yjayja, Toula needs some rest. Let's go home. See you at dinner'' the two siblings walk away, with the grandmother. _/_ A few days after Angelo´s birthday, Toula decided to visit Dr. Turner by herself, in order to ask him more about the attack she had. Of course, in order to not worry anyone, she told her family that she was going to wax her eyebrows; to be pretty to Ian, so everyone could leave her alone. ''Dr. Turner, I know it´s rare women in my age have a heart attack, like I did, but, may i ask what exactly could have cause this?'' she asked after the doctor finish examine her. ''well, Mrs. Miller, as I told Mr. Miller… and your whole family actually, what you have, may be a congenital problem, your father told that your great grandmother had this same problem. You probably had this…hole in your heart, but it never show up, till now. You have been stressed latterly, Mrs. Miller?'' ''a little… a lot actually'' the woman confessed ''well, the stress could have contributed'' Dr. Turner explain. ''here, I will prescribe you another medicine and I will recommend you to rest as much as possible. Mrs. Miller, we are very close to find you a new heart, but meanwhile, you have to keep yourself away from any stress'' ''I will try Dr. Turner, thank you very much'' Toula smiled and walk out of the doctor´s office. As she steps into the waiting room, Toula spotted a scene that made her weak heart broken into thousands of pieces, in one of the chairs, a woman, who Toula presumed be the mother, comforted her daughter, who seemed very ill. Taking a deep breath, she asked the secretary what does the teen girl had and once the secretary explain that the teen in question was also waiting for a heart transplant, so, in an unthinkable act, the Greek woman got back into the office, with an idea in mind, she was going to push pond the chance of a transplant and give the heart to tis girl in need. _/_ Later that same night, Paris woke up with a start, like she felt something was wrong. Scared, the 17-year old jump out of her bed and rushed to her parents room, just to find her mother sleeping soundly, alone in their bed. Breathing in relief, she closed the door and walk downstairs, to find her dad sitting on the couch, with a somber expression on his face. This way, she seat beside him and let him wrapped his arms around her. ''can´t sleep?'' Ian asked and in response Paris shook her head no ''yeah, me neither'' he said ''Dad?'' ''huh?'' ''we´re not going to lose mom are we?'' the girl´s voice was full of emotion ''it's all my fault'' ''no, my sweet girl, what happened to your mom isn´t your fault.'' Ian said ''and you don´t have to worry, she isn´t going anywhere'' he said as they heard footsteps approaching. ''hey,'' it was Toula, who had woken up ''apparently, neither of us couldn´t sleep'' ''it will be a long night, huh, what if us three sleep in here? In the couch'' Ian suggested, as is wife join them. ''good idea Dad!'' Paris agree, embracing both of her parents. That night they sleep in peace.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER 3 – IN THE FAMILY As the days passed, Toula's health became worse and worse. She was tired all the time. She had shortness of breath, just plain around no energy. It was painful for her family, sees her suffering and was painful to her, seen worrying about her. Sure, deep in her heart, Toula regretted telling Dr. Turner to pass the heart forward, however, it was too late to complain now and the only thing she decided to do was pray for another opportunity, as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Paris decided to spill the beans to her parents about her decision she had made. So one morning, as the three members of the Miller family sat down for breakfast, Paris set her spoon down and took in a deep breath. \"I've changed my mind.\" She said making her parents look at her. \"I'm no longer going to N.Y.U. I'm going to be going to Northwestern. I'm staying here in Chicago.\" \"What? Why?\" Toula said her face growing paler. \"You were excited about going to New York. What changed your mind?\" \"Well,\" Paris blushed trying to take in a slow deep breath. \"I want to stay near you two. Yeah I'm excited to go somewhere else, be away from family, but...I want to stay close to you and dad...especially now.\" Toula smiled and gently took Paris's hand. \"I don't want you to lose sight of your dream.\" \"My dream can wait, mom.\" Paris said with a smile. \"Well, you still have a few months to decide for good.\" Ian said while Toula nodded slowly. \"You should come up with your final answer by I'd say the beginning of August.\" \"Okay dad.\" Paris said with a smile. The Miller family finished their breakfast and just after Ian left for work, Toula stood up to take her bowl to the sink when she gripped the edge of the table. \"Mom?\" \"Just dizzy, sweetie.\" Toula said trying to put on a brave smile. \"Mind helping me with dishes?\" \"How about I just do them.\" Paris said with a smile and Toula nodded. _/_ Surprises never excessed to come to the large family of Chicago and after years after their travel agency closed, Voula and Taki decided to open up a Pet Shop and give everyone one dog or cat as gift. Gus ad Maria tried to convince Ian to allow Greek snack at the school's refectory. In the meantime, to Toula and Ian´s relief, Paris and Bennett started to date serious, but prefer to let it just between her parents and his mother, so avoid his father and her grandfather push them to wedding soon. And one night, while everyone was join at Zorba´s for another engagement party, Angelo decided to finally introduce his ''partner'' to the whole family and almost give Gus a heart attack. ''Dad, be cool, times have changed'' Toula tried to calm him down ''But for this?'' he exclaimed while pointing to the two men holding hands. The daughter nodded ''first my daughter marries a Xeno, now we have this. The world is on en'' he whispered in Greek, before walking away sadly. ''What is the matter with him?'' Ian asked, after just passing by Gus ''Nothing'' Toula replies, taking one of her medicines ''just dad been dad. Want to dance?'' ''you sure it´s a good idea? I don´t want to let you tired'' Ian said, but in response, Toula just push him out of the chair he was sitting and they join the Greek dance. _/_ One morning, while Taki was taking care of the shop, Voula decided to pass by Zorba´s in order to visit her sister and brother in law as she always did, in order to chat and complain about something. However, as she approached, Voula noticed Maria talking to the phone, her face was pale and her eyes were watering. ''wh- what happened?'' she asked, trying not to show any worry. ''Ian just called'' Maria took a deep breath, trying to keep her voice steady ''Toula wasn´t feeling well this morning and he took her to the hospital… something about palpitation… I don´t know… he… he just told me she wasn´t feeling well and he took her to the hospital. he asked if someone could go there and pick Paris up.'' ''so what are we waiting for? Let´s go!'' Voula demanded, but seen the look on her sister´s face, she just embraced her ''it´s ok, I'm sure it nothing worse'' she said as suddenly, the door opened and Angelo and Nikki storm into the restaurant ''Ah, Angelo, shut Up! Hi Ma, hi Theia Maria'' the woman smiled ''Nikki, how many times do I have to tell? No yell, be a lady'' Voula scolds her ''Ah, you scold me? Scold Angelo, who want to go to Vegas with his love affair'' ''What´s your problem with that? Are you jealous? I just want to have fun'' the brother argue ''No one…'' Voula raise a hand to her son and daughter ''will leave Chicago, till we make sure Toula recovered? Now go pick up your father and let´s go to the hospital'' upon hear this, both Angelo and Nikki paled and obeyed their mother. _/_ Maria, Nick and Athena, as well as Voula and Taki arrived at Toula´s hospital room not long after Ian called them. They piled up inside the room, trying to console Ian and Paris, who set at her mother´s bedside, holding her hand. Toula was struggling to stay awake, she was tired and groggy. But even in that state she could see her father absent in this gathering. \"What's going on?\" Athena asked looking between her sister and brother-in-law. Ian looked down at his wife gently wiping her sweaty brow. \"Dr. Turner, thinks that this hole in her heart is getting bigger.\" The entire Portokalo family went silent. Looking down at Toula, who closed her eyes but opened them up seconds later. \"The pacemaker she has is helping but...getting a donor is her only best option.\" Ian fought the tears that were forming in his eyes. \"If we can't find one...\" He glanced behind to his wife who had her eyes closed again. \"Don't lose hope, Ian.\" Nick said patting his shoulder. \"Good Greek men never lose hope.\" ''thank you Nick'' the taller man nodded, the last thing he wanted now was to show some weakness. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door and the entire family turned to watch a nurse walk in at first looking taken aback at all the people but eventually made her way towards Toula who was letting a small groan of pain escape her lips. \"Mrs. Miller, I have your medicine here.\" She turned to the large crowd her face fell. \"Unfortunately visiting hours are over for everyone and I would like it if you all left\" The family reluctantly nodded but soon they filed out of the room. _/_ At the restaurant, Gus was feeling a pang of guilty for not going to see his daughter at the hospital, after everything she did for him, however, once he was sure she was going to be alright, he prefer to see her when she got better. Suddenly, the restaurant door opened and Bennett entered, looking both sides for his girlfriend. ''hey, what you doing here?'' Gus asked ''you´re Paris grandfather, aren´t you? I´m looking for her, you know where she is?'' ''she´s at the hospital, her mother is sick…'' Gus was explain, when Paris come in, followed by Maria ''Bennett!'' the girl cried and throw her arms around the boy, who embraced her back ''hey, come on, I will buy you an ice cream and we can talk'' he offered ''you two can date somewhere an adult keep an eye on you'' Gus nagged ''ah, Gus leave them alone'' Maria growled ''Paris, don´t go far and keep your phone with you'' she said and with a nod, the granddaughter left with her boyfriend. ''Maria! You shouldn´t let them alone, we don´t know this boy, we don´t know if he´s a good person or anything'' Gus complained ''ah, stop nagging!'' the older woman snapped ''and you? What a great father you are, not even go see your daughter in the hospital. Preferring to stay here playing these games'' ''I know our daughter is sick Maria, but she will get better, she is Greek and the Greeks invented heart transplant!'' he barked, loud enough to half the restaurant look at him ''it´s true'' he said and embarrassed, walk away. _/_ Back at the hospital, once the family gone away, Ian seat at the chair Paris was previous occupied and gently, he took his wife hand and kissed. Toula´s hand was a bit cold. ''please, you can´t leave me. My Greek statue, you can´t do this to us'' he whispered and got up to kiss her forehead, when he realized she was awake. ''hey how are you feeling?'' ''tired, but fine'' she said ''Ian, we have been together for so long that we end up seeing our shadows as two people'' ''what?'' he trembled from head to toe hearing that ''nothing…I was just thinking… in our wedding day, we didn´t received so much spit'' Toula said, making Ian laugh for the first time in a long time. _/_ Paris got back to her grandparents' home a later that same afternoon after the ice cream date with Bennett and she felt a bit relieved for spend some time away from the suffocation of her family. Later that same night, as she got herself ready to sleep, the 17-year old girl got to the kitchen in order to get a glass of water, just to be surprised by her great grandmother seating alone in the dark. ''Hi Mana-Yja Yja'' she said and the woman caressed her face ''are you worried about mom too, aren´t you? She asked and the old woman nodded ''I don´t know, what Dad and I will do, if something happens to her'' ''Be strong'' was the simple answer, but before Paris could say something, someone ringed the door bell and when Paris went to answer it, she came face with face with Bennett, wearing a sweater and a pajama pants. ''Benny? What are you doing here? What happened?'' the girl was paralyzed with fear ''nothing, I'm just passing by, to make sure you´re okay'' he said and without giving a word, totally overtaken by emotion, Paris wrapped her arms around him and start to cry.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER 4 – HEART RHAPSODY Ian started to do the house chores after Toula got back from the hospital. He knew wife was too weak to do everything, the slightest effort left her dizzy and with shortness of breath, which was very bad to someone in her condition, so, do the chores, was everything he could do to help her.. Sure, Dr. Turner suggested her to use a wheelchair, this way, she could be out of bed for a longer time, but Toula refused, saying it wasn´t necessary. On the other hand, despite of not mention it to Paris, the tall man was really appreciating the support the family was giving them. Every day, almost everyone goes to their house, to cook, wash to them and make sure Toula was okay. Sure, all her family coming into her house and giving opinion about everything, left Paris very annoyed. _/_ ''Ma, Athena, you two don´t need to do that.'' Toula said. It had been a week since she had gotten away from the hospital and she was feeling horrible, as she watched her mother and sister walk around her house, doing chores. Paris had gone to Zorba´s to help around there and Ian was gone to the school, for a teachers meeting. ''of course we need'' the sister replies ''your house is a mess'' '' And your husband cooks very badly. '' Maria added, '' I know he's a vegetarian, but you and Paris are not. And you need to eat meat, you need to feed well, how do you want to be healthy, without eating meat?'' ''well…'' Toula opened her mouth to say something but give up, it was useless trying to talk to a Greek, when meat was involved, so she just leaned back on the couch and let out a small groan, making her mother and sister ran toward her. ''are you feeling alright?'' ''just a bit nauseous, I think it´s those medicines, I'm going to be fine, don´t worry'' Toula smiled to them. _/_ On his way back home, Ian decided to pass by the restaurant, in order to have a cup of coffee and as he should expect, a few members of the family, were there, eating and chatting like nothing bad was happening. Suddenly, someone approached him, it was Bennett and for some reason, he was shaking from head to toe. ''hey, Bennett..?'' Ian smiled back to him ''what is it?'' ''Principal Miller… er… Sir? May I date your daughter?'' the boy asked once and for all. Ian blinked in confusion. He looked to Gus who was watching the scene, then to Paris who embarrassed, wanted to disappear under the counter and back to Bennett, who was white as a ghost. ''aren´t you two already dating?'' it was all he could ask after a few seconds. ''yeah?!'' Bennett answered ''so, don´t need to ask for my permission. If you love her and if she love you as well, then, go for it'' Ian finished ''now, I would like to finish my coffee'' ''sure, Sir'' the boy answered and hushed back to his girlfriend, who was still very embarrassed by the awkward situation. ''Ian, don´t be angry with that boy'' Gus told him, as he sat down ''he did what you should have done, he asked your permission to date Paris, like a nice Greek boy'' The tall man sighted, trying not be annoyed ''I did asked for your permission to date Toula and you don´t allowed'' he said. Of course, Gus tried to argued, but give up, after all, Ian was totally right. ''Dad!'' Paris approached her father and kissed his forehead ''I finished the garlic bread shift, I will be back home to see how mom is doing and then, I will go to the movies with Bennett'' ''sure, have fun you two and tell your mom I will be home in a short. And Bennett, excuse me any inconvenience'' Ian said and with a nod, the two teens gone away. _/_ It was late one night, two weeks later, when things had turn to the worst. The night in question, Paris was sleeping, when suddenly she felt someone shaking her shoulders. It was her dad. ''Dad!'' she froze upon seeing his face wet with tears ''what is happening?'' ''honey, go call your uncle…or grandparents, I´m taking your mom to the hospital'' he gasped ''what?'' the girl jump out of the bed and rushed to her parents room, ignoring her dad´s orders. ''mom?'' Paris kneeled beside her mom´s side of the bed and took her hand, in return, Toula, who was having trouble breathing, tried to put a brave face to her daughter, in vain. Freighted, Paris rushed to seek help, hoping not be the last time she seen her mother´s eyes. _/_ Toula spend quite a few days in the hospital and when she got back home, things doesn´t look good at her, she wasn´t breathing properly, needing to be hooked into an oxygen tank. To make the matters worse, Dr. Turner told Ian, Maria and Gus, that if they didn´t find a new heart in six weeks, they should be prepared for the inevitable. _/_ For the first time since she could ever remember, Paris had a fit of rage the very next morning when her mother had been taken to the hospital. Once receiving the news, Ian suggested that the girl come home and Aunt Voula, had gone with her, to make sure everything was going to be okay. As they crossed the front door, Paris stomped her way towards the bookshelf and kicked the edge causing pictures to clatter to the floor and a flower vase topple to the ground. \"Shit\" Paris cursed running over to grab a broom. Voula however wrapped her arms around her great niece. \"Sweetheart,\" she said rubbing Paris's back. But the rubbing only caused Paris to cry harder. Voula started to hum a soft Greek lullaby Paris had heard her mother hum several times while she grew up. \"Everything will be fine.\" Voula said pushing Paris at arm's length to look into her eyes. \"Greek woman are strong. We do not die that easily.\" Voula said calmly. \" Listen, when I was your age, back in Greece, one day my appendix exploded like rotten tomatoes, it was blood everywhere, not to mention that I got an infection and ended up in a coma for three weeks'' the old woman said and Paris let the tears fall from her eyes as she hugged Voula once again. \"Thank you Thia Voula. I just don´t want to lose my mom\" She said before burring her face to cry into Voula's arm. _/_ The night after she got home, Toula woke up with a strange noise coming from somewhere in the room. Confused, she reached for the bedside lamp, lighting the room and reveling Ian seating on his side of the bed, his face hidden on his hand as he cried. ''Ian?'' she whispered startling the man, who immediately turn around and hold her hand. ''hey love!'' he smiled ''sorry for having wake you up'' ''don´t worry about this. Here, could you hold me? I miss our cuddle'' she said, making him laugh ''I don´t know what I will do without you my Greek statue'' ''don´t think about it Ian. Everything will be ok'' she said and both sleep peacefully. _/_ On a raining morning, Maria was in her kitchen, folding the laundry, when she heard someone knocking the door. It was Toula, who somehow, had walked her way toward her parents' house, for a visit. \"Toula, what on earth are you doing here? You should be in bed not here!\" the older woman opened the door quickly and helped her daughter inside. Toula was like she was about to faint when her mother make her sit down on the nearest chair. She gripped the handle of the oxygen cart and concentrate on her breathing. ''I was going crazy…'' she gasped and took a painful deep breath through the nubbins of the cannula ''…staying inside the house, so i…'' another deep breath ''…walk over here…. Paris and Ian headed to Zorba´s'' '' Well, since you're here, help fold this shirts'' the mother said, placing a handful of clothes on the woman´s hand ''Toula, Don´t ignore me, look at me'' Upon hearing this Toula let go of what she was doing and looked at her mother ''yes, Ma!'' ''Okay, what are you hiding for me?'' Toula looked confused at her mother, still, deep down she knew what Maria was talking about. ''I'm not hiding anything'' Toula lowered her head, avoiding look at her mom ''Toula, I'm your mother, you came from inside me, I know when you are hiding something, so tell me, what are you hiding?'' Taking a breath and trying to hide the dizziness that hadn´t passed yet, Toula's told her mother everything, every detail at that day on the doctor, when she passed forward her chance of a heart transplant. At the end of the story, Maria just sat beside her daughter and pointed a finger to her ''My daughter, you made a very brave decision'' she said ''but also a very selfish one'' she said and Toula's started to cry ''you don´t thought about us, your family, about your daughter and your husband'' Maria tried to sound harsh ''he… that poor man did everything to stay with you, created a life with you and this is the way you pay him? By leaving him alone with your daughter? And what about Paris? Who will give her advices for her wedding day?'' ''Ma, please, I made a huge mistake, so just let me die thinking I was thinking about my daughter, please'' Toula begged to her mom. ''Nah, nah, come here, my baby'' Maria embraced her daughter, letting her cry ''no one is going to die, huh? Don´t lose hope… what they say? Hope is the last to go, right?'' she asked and Toula just nodded. ''Ma?!'' Toula whispered to her mom ''what sweetheart?'' ''after…'' she stopped ''after, you and dad will take care of Ian and Paris? Promise me you guys will never neglect them'' ''yes sweetheart, I promise'' Maria took a deep breath, trying not to cry in front of her daughter. _/_ They took a while to reach the restaurant, since the traffic was a bit difficult due the rain, however, when they parked in front at Zorba´s, Ian could noticed Paris somber expression she has since they left the house. ''Paris? Can you tell me what´s going on?'' Ian looked at his daughter with a serious frown and in response, the girl just shrugged. ''nothing… I found mom a bit strange this morning, the way she hugged me, like she didn't see me in a long time and she told me she love me more than anything'' she said. It was true, that morning, when the teen go give her mother good morning, Toula wrapped her in her week arms, like when Paris was a little girl and when she was about to walk away, the mother told her to remember how much she is loved, which somehow, shocked Paris. ''well… It is not because you have become a teenager, that your mother and I quitted loving you, we do love you very much'' he say. ''no Dad!'' Paris couldn´t help but laugh at her father´s point ''I don´t know… I just had a bad feeling, that´s all'' ''I understand, it´s a hard time to everyone.'' Ian put a hand on Paris shoulder ''but you don´t need to worry, your mom is going to be fine, let´s have faith'' he said'' now let's go, I will have to pass by the school to solve something and want a nice cup of coffee first'' with that, they left the car and walk toward the restaurant. _/_ Zorba´s was crowded today, not only all the men of the family were there, but also, it seemed that all neighborhood decided to have Greek food today and there was even a few people on the waiting line to get a table. Even Ian's parents were there, trying to help with the costumers As usual, Bennett was there to wait for his girlfriend for another date and of course, Gus was giving him a lecture about how the Greeks invented the medicine. ''Hi Benny!'' Paris approached him and give him a kiss ''so, what my Pappou are trying to convince you this time?'' '' Paris, you should have found a Greek boyfriend with more schooling, this guy does not know anything about his ancestors and still insists that the Chinese invented acupuncture.'' ''they did!'' Bennett tried to convince him ''so let me tell you that the word acupuncture came from the Greek word velonismós which means therapy with needles'' he said angry Upon hearing this, Bennett tried to argue, but Ian signed him to stay quiet ''anyway…'' the boy said, now turning to his girlfriend ''let's go watch a movie?'' ''cool! I liked the idea'' Paris answered ''then I will take you to the best pizza in Chicago, ok to you?'' ''sure. Huh! Dad, you mind if i…'' ''have fun you two and be careful'' Ian nodded and after giving her dad a hug, Paris and Bennett left the restaurant. Just after they left, Ian grab a cup of coffee and seat with his parents, who were whispering something to each other, near where Gus was sitting. ''hey Mom and Dad, how you guys are doing?'' the tall man asked a bit uncomfortable ''we´re fine son, we want to know about you, how are you holding up?'' Mrs. Miller asked ''anxious'' he said ''every minute that passes, I got more and more anxious, waiting for a call from Dr. Turner about some donor he found for Toula.'' ''Ian…'' Mr. Miller started ''I know it´s a hard thing to say, but you already thought of the possibility of this surgery does not work? What you will do if this heart they find for your wife, doesn´t work?'' ''Doesn´t Work?'' behind them, Gus had listened the conversation and upon hearing Mr. Miller´s assumption, he and Taki got up from their seats and walked toward the other table, looking angry ''listen here, my daughter it´s decedent from Alexander, The Great, this transplant will work for her and she will be fine!'' Gus snapped. Ian on the other hand, was more embarrassed then shocked and for a moment, his only desire was to disappear under the table. ''hey, it wasn´t my intention, don´t put that way ''Mr. Miller tried to defend himself ''I don´t want nothing to happen to my daughter-in-law, she is an amazing woman, she give us a granddaughter and on top of it she made my son very happy. But I also want to be realist'' ''yeah, but you were also a lot harsh'' said Angelo ''nothing is going to happens to my sister, Mr. Miller'' Nick tried to calm both old men down ''You should apologize ''Taki agreed ''listen, you aren´t Greek'' Gus looked at the other man ''I know it´s hard for you understand what family means, but…'' ''Okay, that´s enough!'' Ian raised his voice. The last thing he wanted now, was a fight with his parents and In-Laws ''Dad, Mom, remember? Silence is Golden'' he said, grabbing his things ''Ian, you will go home?'' Mrs. Miller asked ''yes, but I will pass by the school'' he said ''call you guys later'' he said and rushed away. _/_ Toula was sitting on the couch watching the news when Ian arrived home a few hours later. After the conversation with her her mother, the sick woman felt a bit better, so, once back home, instead of going to bed, she decided to stay on the TV room, waiting for her husband to came. ''Hi!'' he greeted her with a kiss ''what are you doing down here?'' ''long story, short version? I was tired to stay in bed all day.'' She replies, as he sat down ''how was your day?'' '' It was tiring, extremely tiring.'' He said ''but… I have good news'' ''really?'' Toula´s eyes widened in surprise ''what is it?'' ''well, I would wait till Paris got home after her date with Bennett, to tell everything, but… even I can´t hold it much longer'' he said, wrapping his wife on his arms ''Dr. Turner called me on my way back here, they had find a heart that matches with your blood type. He ask if we could go to the hospital tomorrow morning to do some tests and if everything goes smooth, which will go, they can perform the surgery by Friday'' he smiled and in response, Toula gives him a passionately kiss ''well… this is… huge'' Toula smiled, a new hope rising inside her ''I can´t wait to tell Paris this!'' she exclaimed ''me too'' Ian said, suddenly, noticing something different at Toula´s frame ''what?'' ''nothing… suddenly I felt strange, like afraid of undergo this surgery. ''she said ''I mean, not afraid of the operation, but what will happens next, i mean, if the new heart make me love someone else?'' ''well…'' Ian thought of a good answer '' you will have at least 59 other organs to persuade the heart to love me'' he said, making her smile ''Righ, very funny of you. And if the heart belongs to a man?'' ''I can turn myself gay, no problem'' he said, kissing her ''the thing is babe, I love you very, very much, you´re my life Toula, my whole life now, you and Paris. As I told you once, I gain life when I met you and I can´t lose you… I don´t want to lose you… we can´t lose you'' ''Ian, this is the most romantic thing I heard in the last two weeks'' they laugh ''okay, let's talk about something else. When this is over, let's go travel somewhere? Just the two of us?'' ''nice thing. Where? Grece?'' ''nah, well, my parents want to go to Greece again, but I prefer England. London, is so beautiful'' ''okay'' Ian agree'' London it is, God Save The Queen'' he laughed again ''hey, we have to celebrate'' ''I agree'' Toula said ''let me go grab some refreshment'' she said, trying to stand up, but Ian prevent her to do so. ''oh no, no, no, you had done a lot coming down the stairs with this oxygen tank, you need to save your energy for when Paris came so we can tell her the great news'' Ian said ''I will grab us some juice'' ''ok then'' she agreed, they kissed and after Ian help her lying down at the couch, he hushed to the kitchen, to grab something to drink. Once he got back to the kitchen, he felt something strange, Toula had her head up against the couch´s armrest, her eyes were closed and her hand curled into her lap. \"Toula?\" Ian asked setting the cups on the coffee table and siting down next to her. Her breath was very quiet and soft. \"Toula?!\" He said louder. When she didn't move or her breathing didn't quicken, he knew instantly that his wife wasn't better. Fear gripped into his mind as he reached for the cellphone dialing 911. \"Yes,\" he said when the operator answered. \"I need an ambulance...it's my wife, hurry!\" he shouted, fighting to keep the tears from running down his cheeks. He grabbed her whist, finding a very faint pulse. ''don´t leave me babe, don´t leave me'' he whispered over and over again, praying to the ambulance come quickly and to his wife to make trough the hospital.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER 5 – THE MEMORY REMAINS The Dancing Zorbas was closed for costumers, but crowded with family and close friends of the Potokalos and Millers. Even with all the people there nobody cheered. Nobody spoke except to express words of comfort to Ian and Paris, who sat in the corner of the tiny family restaurant packed shoulder to shoulder with people that cared for her late mother. Ian sat in alone at a table near the register, the same spot he sat when he first laid eyes on his Greek Goddess of a wife. He looked up expecting to see her thick framed glasses, long brown hair, moth eaten sweater holding a coffee pot. But she wasn't there. He was alone once again. 'If only,' he thought staring back at the table he sat at. 'If only.' FLASHBACK: Toula was unconscious when the ambulance arrived at the hospital. As the paramedics fought to revive her. Ian ran beside his wife his hands holding hers tightly. As they gurney passed through the double doors that lead further into the hospital, one of the nurses gently stopped Ian who tried desperately to be by his wife's side. But the nurse gently shook her head and told him that everything will be fine. Ian paced his hands running through is hair as he called his in-laws and his own parents, telling them that Toula wasn't doing so well. END OF FLASHBACK _/_ The priest started the first rites of the funeral, after everyone give their eulogies. At the first pew, Paris sobbing uncontrollably, as Ian wrapped her on his arms, trying to protect her from the situation, while trying to keep himself from broke down in front of the entire family. FLASHBACK: Ian paced nervously fingers running through is hair as Toula's and his family sat comforting each other in the waiting room of the hospital. Ian sadly smiled at the speed in which his in-laws and his own parents arrived at the hospital when he had called his best friend, who had married a cousin of Toula, who then proceeded to call everyone in the family. \"She's a Greek Woman,\" Voula said confidently as she rubbed the back of a highly distraught Paris. \"Greek Woman are strong. Your mother will be just fine. She's Greek.\" \"But Thia Voula,\" Paris squeaked tears running down her cheeks smearing the light amount of make-up she had put on for her date with Bennett that morning. \"I'm scared she won't.\" \"Oh stop that nonsense.\" Voula remarked strongly giving her a proud nod. \"Negativity is brought on by non-Greeks.\" Ian spun around but Voula's face changed. \"No offense Ian. You are Greek. It's all those non-Greeks at your school. They rubbed off on you.\" Paris smiled for a split second before succumbing to the tears once again. \"Voula is right.\" Gus announced with a stern nod. \"We Greeks invented positivity. Alexander the Great was positive and thus he passed it down to his family...Us.\" A small quiet cheer spread through the small waiting room, making Ian smile. That smile quickly vanished when he felt a soft tap on his shoulder. He spun around but before the young doctor could say a word, the entire Potokalos family rushed him surrounding the small Jewish man who looked like he was about to pass out by the sheer sight of everyone. \"How is she?\" Gus demanded sizing the man, which wasn't hard. \"How is my daughter?\" \"Kosta,\" Maria hissed gently prying her husband away from the poor man. \"Let the man speak.\" But quickly took the space before the doctor. \"How is my daughter?\" \"Well, Mrs...\" He looked down at his clipboard that had every single member of the Portokalos family on it and looked back at Maria. \"Portokalos. I'm afraid I only wish to speak with Mrs. Miller's husband.\" The waiting room went cold as Ian was quietly led a ways away while everyone strained to try and hear what the doctor had to say. All they heard was a wailing 'No' coming from Ian a ways down the hall and they watched as Toula's husband turned around and slid down to the floor his face twisted in sorrow, a river of tears flowing down his cheeks. Only Paris who continued to sit next to Voula silently cried at the unheard news. Her mother, the strong Greek woman who everyone praised of being the strongest, wasn't coming home after all. END OF FLASHBACK _/_ Once the service and burial over, the family gathered together at Ian´s house for the luncheon and while the adults talked and eat, the kids played at the front yard, when one of them, noticed one of the neighbors, trying to spy on the house. ''let´s go scare her? ''One of the boy suggested ''cool, great idea'' his brother said as they walked toward the neighbor ''hello!'' the first boy, Mike smiled ''hi?'' the neighbor, Mrs. White look annoyed at him ''er… we want to tell you something… it´s an warning'' the other boy said ''a warning?'' ''yeah. Our aunt died… and in Greece, when a neighbor spy on the dead person´s house at the day the person´s funeral, the spirit get mad and hunt the person who is spying, for the rest of their lives'' Herons explain Upon hearing this, Mrs. White paled and after a awkward ''excuse me'' she marched toward her house very fast and the boys brooked down laugh. _/_ Back in the house, Gus was quiet, he was having trouble believe his younger daughter had died and was having no desire to talk to anyone, so he just kept checking his Facebook from time to time and observing everyone around. ''Pappou... \"Gus looked up for a second, to see Paris and Bennett standing right in front of him. His granddaughter gave him a sideways sad smile and looked into his eyes. \"Pappou, Bennett wanted to say something to you.\" She said and stood and took a step back, giving Bennett some space. \"Mr. Portokalos, I'm very sorry for your loss.\" Bennett said his eyes full of sincere grief but Gus wasn't wanting this. His daughter wasn't dead. This was just all a misunderstanding. That this was nothing more than a nightmare he was going to wake up from. \"Yeah, thanks.\" He said to Bennett, his voice annoyed. He looked up at his granddaughter who looked close to tears. \"Paris, where's your father?\" \"He's in the dining room.\" Paris said wrapping her arms around Bennett's arm and turned to leave. \"If he asks, I'll be in the yard.\" Gus nodded and watched as his granddaughter and Bennett left the house and out the door. _/_ ''Nick, could you please left this tray of spanakopita to the living room please and ask Harry if she could help with the soda'' at the kitchen, Maria was trying to keep herself busy, cooking something, giving orders to Athena and Nick, helping Mrs. Miller with cleaning the dishes, just to have something else to think. Sometimes she raised her head to see Gus at the couch and shake her head in disapproval. ''Ma, why don't you have some rest?'' Athena asked, coming with a few cups of soda ''Athena, how can I rest now with all this people around?'' Maria asked acting like her daughter´s question was an absurd ''now, could you Keep an eye on the sauce for me? I will go see if Ian needs something'' she said and walk away from the kitchen. _/_ At the other side of the room, the three kids were watching TV and laughing at the prank they had thrown on Mrs. White, when suddenly, Mr. Taki appear behind them. ''what the three of you are doing?'' he asked angry ''sorry Theo Taki, we were just laugh about something'' one of them explain '' Well, stop it right now, today is not a day of laughter. Stay still or go to the garden.'' The old man warned them, before walk away. _/_ The wake was drawing to an end as mourners started to leave giving Ian a comforting goodbye hug. \"Are you sure you don't want to stay with us for the night, son?\" Mr. Miller asked. But Ian shook his head and tried to give him a smile. \"I need some more time to come to grips with this.\" he said taking in a deep breath to calm himself down. \"Besides Paris needs me right now. But thanks dad.\" \"Well, if you need anything just call.\" Mrs. Miller said pulling her son into a hug. \"Will do mom.\" Ian smiled and gave his mom a hug and he watched as his parents walked out, both feeling regretted for what they had said to their son at the restaurant. ''Mr. Miller, I'm very sorry'' Bennett said, shyly shaking hands with Ian ''no need to say sorry, kid, just been there for my daughter today, let me relieved'' Ian replies ''cool… ah! My parents ask me to apologize they could come an ask me to express their condolences'' \"Tell your parents I appreciate that'' Ian said and after giving another good bye to his girlfriend, Bennett go back home. Soon it was just him, his daughter and only a small handful of his late wife's family. Feeling like he didn't want to talk to any of his in-laws, he just sat down next to Paris who immediately threw her arms around her father and they cried together both aching with the major loss they both experienced. _/_ Sitting in that armchair, Gus couldn't handle all the buzzing of his phone as alerts from his Facebook page, so he sat looking over all the comments he had received while Maria kept herself busy by trying to plan meals to make Ian and Paris in the next few weeks. Paris sat with Nikki and it was clear, Nikki was trying to distract Paris with thoughts of other things, such as hairstyles, make-up and fashion. It seemed to be working as Paris smiled and joined in the conversation. Ian was saying goodbye to some more people who were leaving when Voula and Taki approached him, both seemed very tired from the day. ''my dear, came to our house for a talk someday'' said the old woman ''I will make a vegetarian dish I found on internet, it doesn´t seems so tasty, but I will do it for you'' she said, making the tall man chuckle ''our house are open for you and Paris every time you need Ian'' Taki patted the other man´s shoulder. ''thank you, for everything'' Ian give them a hug ''oh, my poor niece, she chose the right man to merry'' Voula lamented ''well, I will be back tomorrow at evening, to see if you and Paris need anything'' she said walk away with her husband. _/_ Ian´s house was winding down to only a small handful of family mourners. Maria sat on the couch beside her husband, both of them were staring at Ian fighting back the emotions as he was hugging Nick, who was giving Ian a bone crushing hug. \"You know Gus,\" Maria said softly making him turn and look at her. \"Sometimes I feel like this is just a bad nightmare. That we're here for a whole different reason. That our daughter will be walking in with lamb sandwiches. Laughing and telling stories about her and Ian.\" Maria's eyes were clouding over, so Gus closed his phone and pull her into a hug. They silently allowed several tears from falling out of their eyes. \"Please call if you need anything,\" Nick said still crushing Ian. \"I mean it Ian. You call me if you need anything.\" \"I will, I will.\" Ian groaned gently prying himself free form the hug. \"Thanks for coming. its means a whole lot.\" \"Anything for family.\" Nick remarked giving Ian another bone crushing hug before he let go walking out of the house with his wife and kids. \"Well, I need to go as well, Ian.\" Athena said gently hugging her brother-in-law. \"And don't worry, I'll be over tomorrow to help with the cleaning…'' ''No need to w-'' ''Of course I need to worry, we need to take care of family. Come on kids, let's go. Yannis, where´s my coat'' she shouted to her husband and go out the house. ''Hey bud'' Ian´s friend Mike gives him a hug ''I'm really sorry. Call me if you want to talk'' ''Came to our house for lunch, I will make baklava'' said Mike´s wife _/_ As everyone left, except for Maria and Gus, Paris plopped herself into the couch and hold a pillow close to her chest. Her face and eyes were puffy and red from crying, still, she let the tears fall. ''glykiá mou'' Maria sat beside her granddaughter and hold her into her arms, saying soft word as she cried. ''I want my mom Yjayja'' Paris cried, calling for her mother ''I know sweetie, I know'' the old woman tried to comfort her granddaughter, in vain. Meanwhile, Ian walked from a side to another in the house, trying to fix and clean small things, in order to keep his head occupied, otherwise, he would certainly lose it and he needed to be strong for his daughter. Suddenly, a soft but heavy hand touched his shoulder, it was Gus, who looked at him with a deep grief in his eyes. ''Ian, I am sorry for been so rude with you when the first time you came into our world, I was wrong about you, you are a very nice guy and I thank you, very much for making my daughter so happy all these years'' he said. It was the last straw for the two men breakdown crying, Gus embraced his son-in-law who did the same and they stood there for a whole minute, then, Gus and Maria decided to go home, in order to let both father and daughter grieve in privacy for a bit, but promised to come back later that day, to check on them. _/_ Back at their home, later that night, Gus couldn´t sleep, after spend half the night comforting Maria who cried herself to sleep, he found himself unable to and decided to stroll the house in order to got tired and sleep, when suddenly, something catch his eyes. A photograph of his three children, taken at the day of Nick´s wedding. With a watered smile then he kissed the photo and took from his pocket a small card that Bennett had given to Paris earlier that day. ''it´s bad luck give romantic cards to someone at a funeral day, that Greek boy should know that'' Gus said, looking at the photo ''so, I will keep this card with me and I will only retrieve it to Paris, after I make sure the boyfriend is a nice person. besides, if Paris goes to New York, she won´t need this card anyway and can for sure, find another Greek boyfriend, wiser than this one'' Gus whispered, hiding the card inside a book and going back to his bedroom, convinced that Toula would approve his attitude.[Chapter 6] We reached the end of the story, i hope you like it and in case i don´t see you. i say ''Good afternoon, good evening and good night.'' thanks for Reading CHAPTER 6 – THERE ISN´T A PLACE LIKE HOME A few months had come and gone since Toula had passed away and slowly each member of the Portokalos family tried to become normal but they knew that they wouldn't be completely normal. The Miller family, however fought with normalcy for weeks, and with school barely starting, Paris felt empty and nervous. Her father had been asking her about where she was going to study and she was feeling annoyed by the constant questioning. \"Dad,\" Paris groaned as she quickly ate a spoonful of cereal. \"Do we really have to talk about this?\" \"I'm just wondering where you're going to study.\" Ian answered his face was soft and his voice matched. He wasn't made about her. He was just wondering what his daughter was planning to do with her life. \"Will you be going to Northwestern or NYU? That's all I want to know. We'll completely support your decision.\" Paris looked at her father with large eyes. She had the same color eyes as her mother. She let out a sigh and glanced at the empty chair that her mom would normally sit while having their discussions. She glanced back at her father who was now looking at his cereal bowl ready to eat the last couple of bites. \"I don't know.\" Paris finally said. She looked at her father who was hiding back tears, she needed to change the subject soon. \"Dad, are we going to Thia Voula's dinner tonight?\" Ian nodded silently. \"Okay.\" Paris stood up and took her bowl to the sink. \"Changing the subject again are we?\" Ian asked watching his daughter move. \"I wasn't changing the subject dad.\" Paris sighed turning around. \"I was just wondering because that way I can tell the whole family what I think all at once.\" \"Okay, that sounds like a good plan.\" Ian said picking up his empty bowl and taking it to the sink. He wrapped Paris in a deep warm hug and laid his cheek on top of her head. \"As long as you make a choice.\" Paris smiled and gently hugged her father back. \"I will dad.\" They broke the embrace and Paris headed for her phone which was charging on the counter near the entryway. \"Going somewhere?\" Ian asked seeing her type something on it before pocketing it in her jacket. \"I'm going...to talk to mom first.\" Paris watched as Ian gave a sad nod in understanding. \"Then I think I'll go talk with Nikki's salon for her to help me with my hair for tonight.\" \"You planning on going on a date with Benny tonight?\" \"No, he's going to be there.\" Paris blushed. \"I want to look beautiful for him.\" Ian chuckled and shook his head. \"You'll always be beautiful.\" Paris smiled up at her dad and rushed out of the house, first giving him a small kiss on the cheek, then with a small wave goodbye left the house leaving Ian all alone to glance at his wedding photo which hung on the wall beside him. \"Our daughter is growing up, Toula.\" He said gently stroking the frozen smiling face of his wife in the picture. ''I love you'' _/_ Paris sat in the beauty salon her mother's cousin Nikki work, and sat down in one of the few unused seats. \"You just want a curl?\" Nikki asked seeing Paris sitting quiet and still like a marble statue. \"Paris?\" Nikki's sharp question made Paris jump. \"You need to relax. I'm sure you'll make the right choice. And regardless, you said it yourself you felt your mom give you a sign that you made the right choice.\" \"Yeah, I know she did.\" Paris sighed and looked at herself in the mirror. \"And I do just want a curl.\" Nikki smiled and began to work curling Paris' hair and then began to style it as well. The girl didn´t mentioned college for the rest of the day. _/_ Meanwhile at the school, Ian was furious to say the least, a few weeks after he got back to work, he had noticed a few people, whispering behind his back and decided to put an end on it at once. Turns out, it was one nosy teacher, who decided to spill the beans to the whole school that the handsome Mr. Miller, the principal, was now 'available' and in result, all the teachers, were just whispering to each other, who would date him first. ''you want us to talk to her?'' asked Nick, when Ian told the story to the family ''no, of course not'' Ian widened his eyes in surprise ''I already took care of that, I'm the highest authority within the school, so i take it as an insult and fire the culprit'' ''well said'' Patrick approve ''why use violence, when we can talk?'' ''let´s cheer on that'' the taller man agree and no one touched that subject anymore. _/_ Zorba´s was crowded that night, full of family members who came to congratulate Voula for her birthday. The place was cheerful, a small band played a few Greek songs as a few of people dance. ''Ian!'' Nick exclaimed his brother in law´s name as both Ian and Paris entered the restaurant ''we thought you two aren´t coming'' ''honestly, I was having doubt if come or not, my back is a bit sore'' Ian confessed ''it´s because you´re been sleeping on the couch'' Maria scold him. For more than once she catch him sleeping there at the last months ''go back to sleep on your bed and you will see that your back will be good as new again'' she said and annoyed, Paris rushed to her aunt´s side, as she talked to Bennett and his aunt. ''happy birthday Thia Voula!'' she hug her '' efcharistó my favorite niece'' the old woman hug her back. ''I will be right back to talk to you, need to ask something to Angelo'' she said walking around ''Paris you look so nice with curled hair'' Bennett smiled at her ''thanks Benny'' the girl smiled and kissed her boyfriend ''Paris, I want to introduce you my aunt, the one I told you about'' Bennett said ''Thia Eudoria, this is my girlfriend Paris. Paris, thia Eudoria'' ''Agapitoí korítsi'' the old woman said in Greek and give Paris a bone crush hug ''it is a pleasure meet you finally, Bennett told me everything about you. I´m so very sorry. But don´t be Sad anymore, know you have an fýlakas ángelos watching over you'' she said and Paris felt a bit embarrassed. ''er…thanks…'' ''let's dance?'' Bennett suggested, trying to break the ice. ''only if it´s now!'' Paris agree and follow Bennett to the dance space. _/_ Conversation, music and dance was heard everywhere at the restaurant. Athena and thia Ginny, were talking to Ian the best day they could go to his house, for a cleanup, after all, in their point of view, he was a bit lazy in regards to clean a house. ''other than that, I think I will need to go to your house this weekend, to iron your shirts, the headmaster of an institution can´t walk around like this, all baggage'' Maria said ''Ian, you should take care of yourself, how you want to be respected?'' 'i…'' Ian was having trouble trying to find a correct answer ''oh don´t worry, we will can discuss it later'' his mother in law smiled ''now come, let's eat'' ''aww! They aren´t cute together, Mr. Portokalo?'' Mrs. Eudoria commented, as she and Gus watched Paris and Bennett join the others to dance ''my granddaughter it´s, as well as all my family, descendent of Alexander the Great! I tell Mrs. Eudoria, if they get married, your nephew will have the perfect wife, my daughter, Fortoula…'' he crossed himself ''…raised her well'' ''Alexander the Great, really?'' she asked surprise ''Bennett descend from Aristotle and Plato'' she said ''if they get married, your granddaughter will have the perfect husband as well'' she said and in response, Gus just rolled his eyes, annoyed. At the other side of the room, the kids were debating the origins of the word ''restaurant.'' While Nick and Angelo were teasing Ian about a football team. _/_ After the prayers and Aunt Voula cut the cake, Paris got up and exclaimed she has an announcement to make and for a second, the family got deadly silent, afraid of hear bad news all over again. ''guys, I talked to Dad and he asked me what school I wanted to go'' she started ''I was kind of in doubt before… and well… I kind of was excited to go away… but…'' she stopped for a second, to look to all her family ''I step back in my decision… and… Northwestern seems a good place to study after all'' Paris barely finished saying that and everyone ran to her, for an embrace and kisses. ''honey mou, what great news!'' Maria exclaimed and hug her granddaughter ''cool, I'm going to Northwester too, we can have lunch together'' said Bennett, giving her a kiss ''honey, are you sure about this?'' Ian asked a bit concerned ''you can go to New York if you want, I'm not going to be sad'' ''hey Dad, why not study around home? I do think Northwestern is a good place, besides, there isn´t a place like home, right?'' the girl said, hugging her father. ''yeah, there isn´t'' Ian agree with a smile. ''Hey!'' Angelo exclaimed ''Let´s celebrate!'' ''in agreement, OPA!'' his mother agreed and one by one, everyone start to hold hand and dance the song rhythm, forgetting for a moment, about the tragedy they faced not long ago. _/_ Later that night, after going back home, Ian Finally decided to have courage to face his own room, once a bath took, he just lied down on his bed, hopping that Maria was right. And the morning after, his back, was good as new again. EPILOGUE: At her new Dormitory at Northwester campus, Paris unpacked her bag, arranging some things and placing a photograph of her parents at her bedside table. When suddenly, another girl entered in the room, with her laptop, she seemed a bit embarrassed, but happy to be there ''hey!'' Paris greeted her ''hello. Nice to meet you, I'm Elizabeth. And you?'' ''I'm Paris. Where do you from?'' ''Boston. And you?'' ''Chicago'' ''The Windy City? Awesome!'' Elizabeth exclaimed, then stop, look at the doorway and back to Paris ''er… are they going to stay?'' At the doorway, Ian and the rest of the family stood still, watching the girls interact, without saying a word. ''guys…'' Paris get up from the bed and walk toward her family, both embarrassed and sad ''okay, we´re going!'' Ian raised his hand on the air, as Gus passed by him and give Paris a bottle of Windex and a kiss on her forehead ''thanks Pappou'' she smiled at him ''call me on Face Time, honey'' Maria said, leaving with her husband ''Don´t forget to eat well'' Voula completed ''tomorrow I will be back to curl both of your hairs, so you two can go to first day in classes, beautiful'' Nikki offered. ''don´t stay awake all night and do your homework.'' Ian ordered ''love you honey, see you Saturday, bye'' ''bye Dad'' Paris replies ''bye'' Ian said, closing the door of the dormitory, certainly that his daughter will be alright and happy with her choice. END. ","Summary":" To Whom It May Concern... My name is Dr. Serpico and I'm here to present you my second story on ''M"},{"Movie":"Bloomington","Title":"A New Life","Author":"c.roy","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8164288","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: I have not posted on here in years. I lost all of my creativity juices long ago and have written very little over the last five years. I recently saw this movie for the first time and I absolutely loved it. The ending left me wanting more, so this is how I channeled that. I do not own Bloomington, the characters, etc. If I did, Allison McAtee would be sitting beside me on a tropical island wearing nothing. I hope you enjoy! I appreciate reviews of any kind! Thank you! I remember watching her out my window as she did an interview before she left Bloomington, I couldn't stop but think that I had made a huge mistake. Part of me felt as though I was just letting her walk away. It is funny for me to think back about how scared she was our first time, but now I am the one who is scared. I had never felt as vulnerable with anyone else and I was terrified. That was close to two years ago and I still think about Jackie often. I just accepted a teaching position at UCLA and couldn't be happier to get out of the lull I had been stuck in recently. Jackie had risen to instant stardom once Neptune 26 came out and it was crazy to think about our time together and how quick it all went by. I can't exactly say that I have gotten over her either. I remember the last time we were together she asked me if I hated her, I almost broken down right then, but I was able to hold myself together until she left. I never intended to fall in love with her, she was different though. She was so different from all of the others. I wish I could tell her that now. Being back in California was always one of my dreams, after selling my house in Indiana, I bought a house in Brentwood, which was close enough to school but far enough away for privacy at the same time. The best thing about the move was that none of the ridiculous rumors followed me. I was able to really start all over again. I arrived in California in early July in hopes that I would get the house ready before the school year. I figured it would keep me occupied, but it didn't take as long as I expected and I was moved in within the first two weeks, with plenty of time on my hands for the rest of the summer. Ethan loved the new yard, he enjoyed spending his days outside while I read on the porch. One day during my second week of living in Brentwood I met some of my neighbors, a very friendly couple with two young children. The husband, Daniel, was a producer in Hollywood and the wife, Abigail, was an elementary school teacher. The couple invited me over to a dinner they were having later in the week, I gladly accepted in hopes that I would continue to meet more people. For the last two years I had stayed to myself, I was scared to let anyone in. I immersed myself into research work and ignored everything else around me. I knew that I could not continue my life of solidarity. Saturday night came quicker than I expected and I found myself wandering over to the Tripp's with a bottle of red wine. I was excited to meet new people and get to know my new neighbor's a bit more. \"Catherine, so good to see you again!\" Abigail greeted. \"Abigail, thank you for inviting me. This is for you and Daniel. It is one of my favorites.\" \"You shouldn't have, thank you. Remember Daniel's friend from work, Samuel, who I told you about earlier in the week?\" Obviously one of their first questions when we met was if I was married, I think one of the reasons they invited me tonight was to set me up with one of their friends. It was a kind gesture, nonetheless. \"Yes, I do remember you telling me about him.\" \"Great! I was just telling him about you, come this way.\" She ushered me towards a very handsome man in his early 30s. He was extremely attractive and I smiled at him politely. I kept reminding myself that I needed to meet people and one date would not hurt me. One date means I am moving in the right direction and that is exactly what I needed. \"Samuel, this is Catherine. She just moved in next door, she is a professor at UCLA. Catherine, this is Samuel, he works with Daniel.\" She moved me closer to him, she looked at us both and smiled before walking away. \"I'm sorry about that.\" I apologized. \"No, don't be sorry. Abigail is sweet like that. She has a huge heart.\" Samuel smiled and I found myself smiling as well. \"Do you want something to drink, I was just about to grab another beer.\" \"Sure. I will have a glass of red wine.\" We walked over towards the bar that was set up and he ordered our drinks. \"What brings you to Brentwood?\" \"I really have not been here very long, as Abigail mentioned. I worked at a small college in Bloomington, Indiana for as long as I can remember. I took some time off from that and traveled over the last two years, mostly backpacking around Europe. I got the opportunity to teach for UCLA's master program in Psychology and I could not turn it down, so here I am. What about you? What brings you here?\" \"I was born and raised in Los Angeles, it is really all I know. My father was a producer and I followed in his footsteps. Daniel and I have worked together on several projects and have become great friends along the way. Were you originally from Bloomington?\" \"Yes, I grew up there. I went to Stanford for my undergrad though, so California is not a completely new experience. I fell in love with it many years ago and just never had the opportunity to make a life for myself here.\" \"Brentwood is a gorgeous area, you could not have picked a better location. I always give Daniel a hard time for moving out here once he started a family with Abigail. We had houses next to each other in Hollywood, but he did not want his children being raised in that environment.\" \"I really love it so far. It is nice to be so close to the city but live outside of it enough to have a yard. My dog is smitten with his new space. I have not been to Hollywood in years.\" \"Perhaps we could change that?\" I took that as my cue that he wanted to ask me out. I went with it, for the first time in two years I went along with the notion of someone asking me out. \"Maybe Monday night, if you are free?\" \"That sounds wonderful, yes, I am free on Monday.\" I smiled before taking a sip of my wine. \"Great. It is a date.\" We talked a little while longer before one of his friends needed him. I made conversation with a few other people before calling it a night. It was nice to get out of the house. Ethan was waiting at the door for me when I got home, like he always was. \"Good evening, Mr. Ethan. And how was your night?\" I laughed as I talked to him, already knowing he was not going to give me a response. He followed me as I walked upstairs to my master bedroom. At night I would think about Jackie the most, probably because I missed having her next to me. I miss watching her sleep, all curled up, next to me. I only have myself to blame, I let her leave and I did not even try to stop her. I just wish I told her how I feel. Even Ethan misses having her around, whenever she is on TV he sits straight up and his tail starts wagging, it is quite adorable. For the next two days I started moving things into my office at school, making it my own. I found old books that I forgotten I had, bringing me back to different research that I had done. I found a book that Jackie had given me for Christmas. Inside she had written a short message: Catherine, You amaze me every single day. Thank you for everything. I finally found a book that you might enjoy. Merry Christmas! Love, Jackie It was nothing over the top, it was short and sweet. I did love that book too, she knew me too well. I finished putting things away and headed home when Samuel called me. \"Hello?\" \"Catherine, its Samuel.\" \"Hi, how are you?\" \"Great, you?\" \"Good, just on my way home.\" \"I made us reservations for tonight at STK. I have a car picking you up at 8:30. I am at work still and I won't get out until a little bit later than normal. Is that okay?\" \"That's fine, thank you. I will see you tonight then.\" I smiled. I was really looking forward to dinner with Samuel tonight. When I got home I got ready for the night and when there was a knock on the door, I was just finishing up. I figured it was probably the driver he sent for me. I was not sure if he was trying to show off or simply was being kind. One of the biggest turnoffs to me has always been when someone tries to show off in an attempt to woo me. I was leaning towards it being a kind gesture because he was working late. When I opened the door I was greeted by a young driver. \"Hello Ms. Stark, I am Westley. I will be your driver this evening. Mr. Williams has instructed me to take you to STK where he will meet you. He apologizes for not being able to pick you up himself.\" \"Well thank you, Westley. I just need to grab my purse and shoes and I will be right out.\" \"As you wish, I will be by the car.\" I grabbed the last few things I needed and before walking out the door I took a deep breath. I had not been on a date in years. I wondered if I still had it in me to date or if I had any idea of what is expected. Does he think I am going to sleep with him on the first date? I do not sleep with anyone on the first date. Well, only with Jackie, but that was much different. If he buys me dinner do I have to sleep with him as a thank you? Good lord, I am an adult. I can do whatever I want to do. I will not let him pressure me into anything I do not want to do. Okay, Catherine, relax. It is going to be fine. You hit it off really well with him the other night. Tonight will be fine. My mind was racing with all of these different thoughts and I needed to calm down and just enjoy the evening. The ride through Beverly Hills to West Hollywood was busy, just as I had expected. We managed to arrive right on time though and Samuel was waiting outside of the door. \"Catherine! So good to see you again.\" He said as he helped me out of the car. He gave me a quick hug and small peck on the cheek. \"It is good to see you as well.\" \"Our table is already.\" He said as he placed a hand on my lower back and showed me the way in. We were sat right away at a private table in the back. \"How was your day?\" \"It was good. I started to set up my office at UCLA today. I have a lot of things to go through before it is quite how I want it set up. How about you?\" \"Long. Daniel and I are in the beginning stages of a new movie we are hoping to produce. It is a lot of time spent on the phone at this stage. I am sorry that I could not be there to pick you up, I have been waiting to speak with a director for a week now and the first time I could get him on the phone was the same time I had to leave to pick you up.\" \"It's fine. No need to apologize. Thank you though.\" \"May I ask what the new movie is about?\" \"Of course, it is based on a true story of a family from Baltimore and how they were able to get off the streets and they now live in one of the nicest suburbs of Baltimore. It is a feel good story.\" \"What gave you the idea of the story?\" \"I met the son of the family at a charity event in New York two years ago. He was there representing the charity the family formed that is an affiliate of the charity putting on the event. His story amazed me and ever since I have been trying to put together a movie based on their story.\" \"Wow, that's...\" I was cut off by a voice behind me. \"Samuel!\" \"Jackie! How are you, dear?\" \"Good, very good. I just got back from shooting in England. It was...\" For a moment I thought I was dreaming. I hoped that I was dreaming. I turned around and there she stood, right behind me. I could not move. I could not think. I could not do anything but sit and stare at her. I was finally torn away from reverie when Samuel stood up and gave her a hug. Her face showed the same shock as mine when our eyes met and she stopped mid-sentence just as I had before when I heard her voice. We both stared at each other, still in shock that we were standing in front of one another. I did not know what to say and the silence was becoming increasingly awkward. Samuel finally broke the ice and introduced us, even though neither of us needed any introduction. \"Catherine, this is Jacqueline. I worked with her last year on a film.\"[Chapter 2] After Samuel introduced Jackie to me I wasn't sure what to say or do. Jackie looked just as equally shocked. \"Hi Catherine, very nice to meet you.\" She finally broke the silence after what felt like hours. The way she said my name put my stomach in knots. \"Good to meet you too, Jacqueline.\" \"So, you were saying, you just got back from England?\" Samuel made an attempt to further the previous conversation. \"Yes, the shoot kept getting extended. One of the other actors had a hard time getting to the set on time. I enjoy London though; Chris lived there for a few years, so we got to see a lot of his friends.\" \"You and Chris are still together? That's awesome, I better be invited to the wedding.\" \"Whoa now! We are not in any hurry.\" I had read rumors online that she was dating an actor who she had worked with last year. I had always hoped they were just rumors though. \"Samuel, how did you and Catherine meet?\" \"Daniel and Abigail set us up. She just moved into the house next to them. I will let her introduce herself.\" \"I just got a teaching position at UCLA for their masters program in Psychology. I moved out here from Bloomington, Indiana. I'm jealous you just got back from London, it is one of my favorite cities.\" \"Oh wow! Congratulations on your new job. I should get back to my friends. It was very nice to meet you, Catherine. Good to see you Samuel. I'm sure I will see you again.\" \"Nice meeting you as well.\" I said softly as she turned around to go back to her table. I sat back down slowly trying to ease myself back into reality. \"Catherine, are you okay?\" Samuel asked as we started looking over the menu. \"Yes, I am good. What do you recommend?\" \"The filet is always amazing. It may sound cheesy, but the truffle fries are to die for.\" \"That sounds really good.\" \"I'm Patrick, I'll be your server this evening. Ms. Kirk has already requested to buy your first round of drinks. What can I start you off with?\" Of course she did. \"That was very sweet of her. I'll have the Strawberry Cobbler.\" \"I will have the Green Intensity.\" Samuel ordered his drink and turned back towards me. \"Jackie is sweet like that. She's a great kid, never forgot her manners when she made it big. So, Catherine… Tell me more about yourself, any brothers or sisters?\" \"Unfortunately no, I was an only child. My parents passed away when I was a teenager. I had an aunt who raised me afterwards, but she passed away a few years ago.\" \"I am so sorry.\" \"It's okay. You didn't know. It was a long time ago, I am a stronger person because of it. How about you?\" \"I have three sisters, they all live here in LA and they all work in the industry. As I mentioned the other night, my father was a producer, so we all grew up around movies and TV. Did you ever want siblings?\" \"Not until after my parents died. I enjoyed growing up as an only child, but it was lonely once they were gone.\" Patrick came back with our drinks and took our food order. I was trying to enjoy Samuel's company but my mind kept going back to the young blond sitting somewhere behind me. My mind was swirling with everything from the past two years. \"Are you sure you are okay? You look distant all of a sudden.\" \"I'm fine, don't worry. Just enjoying tonight, it has been very lovely. I am having a really good time.\" \"Good, I'm glad. You just seem quiet.\" \"I apologize. I was setting my office up today, that is where I was when you called earlier.\" \"Oh yeah, when do you start teaching?\" \"The first week in September classes begin. I have been starting to create my lesson plans and go through the curriculum a bit more. I have had quite a few students already start to email me for the syllabus for the course. It does not look good when the students are more prepared than me.\" \"You are going to hate me, but I researched some of your papers that you have had published.\" \"Oh god, no you didn't?\" I said as my face turned red. \"They were great! I loved the one on the reversal of self-denial. You seem very passionate about the topic, it showed through your writing.\" \"Thank you.\" I relaxed a bit at the compliment. \"It is one of my favorites, I spent quite a bit of time on that paper.\" \"I enjoyed reading it.\" \"I should be honest with you then, I looked up a few of the movies you have produced. I had actually seen a few of them already. I am not a huge movie buff, I would rather read, but there are some good movies that you have done.\" \"I would like to think so, thank you. Do you miss Bloomington?\" \"No, my time there was over before I left. I needed a fresh start more than anything. I am really looking forward to what is to come.\" An hour ago this would be true. \"Me too.\" He smiled widely. We enjoyed the remainder of our dinner, he was right about the food. It was incredible. As we finished our final drinks, he paid the bill and we got up to leave. This is when he is supposed to ask if I wanted to go back to his place for a drink. I was actually dreading the moment, even though the date was lovely. I wanted to get home and freak out about seeing Jackie. I wanted to be alone more than anything so my mind could slow down. \"I have had a great time this evening, Catherine.\" \"As have I, Samuel.\" \"I would like to see you again.\" \"That can be arranged.\" I did have a good time and I really did enjoy his company. I should not let the fact that I saw Jackie ruin what could be. \"I have a premiere on Thursday if you would like to join me.\" \"Really?\" \"I would like you to be there with me.\" \"Of course. I look forward to it.\" \"Good. I do too. I would love nothing more than to ask you back to my place this evening.\" \"But…\" I continued his sentence. \"I have a conference call at five o'clock in the morning, I have to be at the office by 4:30 so I can prepare. We are proposing a budget for a new movie and the people we are proposing the budget to are in New York.\" \"Ahh... That's okay. We have Thursday night.\" I smiled, mostly because I was relieved that I would be going home. He drove me back home and walked me to my door. I was kind of shocked at how much of a gentleman he was. Chivalry may not be dead after all. \"I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, Catherine. I had a great time tonight.\" \"Me too, thank you for dinner.\" \"Thank you for joining me.\" He said before leaning in to kiss me goodnight. It was a simple kiss that let me know he really wanted more, but did not want to rush things. \"Good night.\" He said before turning back towards his car. I opened my door and was promptly greeted by Ethan. \"Hey buddy. I had a great night, thank you for asking. I ran into an old pal of yours, do you remember Jackie?\" At the sound of her name he perked up and got excited. \"Yeah, I remember her too.\" I walked to the kitchen and poured myself a glass a wine. After I took my first sip a tear rolled down my cheek and I had to sit down as I became overwhelmed with all of the emotions from the last two years. I moved to the living room and put the TV on as I drifted to sleep. It was almost one in the morning when the doorbell rang, I thought I was dreaming. It took me a few moments to get up and walk towards the door and when I finally looked out the window I saw a small form retreating back to the driveway. I opened the door and started walking towards the form. \"Jackie, is that you?\" She turned towards me and my thoughts were confirmed. \"What… How do you know where I live?\" \"I shouldn't have come here. I'm sorry, I saw the light on and I thought it would be a good idea to ring the bell, but it wasn't and I'm sorry. I'm leaving.\" \"Jackie, stop… What are you doing here?\"[Chapter 3] Disclaimer – I don't own any of the original Bloomington characters. I just have fun writing about them. \"I wanted to see you.\" \"At one in the morning?\" I asked, trying to be upset with her. \"What are you doing here?\" She replied with a question. \"You are asking me that question as you stand outside my house at one in the morning.\" \"I mean in LA.\" \"How do you even know where I live?\" \"Samuel said that you were neighbors with Daniel.\" \"So you thought it was a good idea to show up at my house at one in the morning…\" \"Catherine…\" She started before pausing for a moment. I cut her off before she could continue. \"Come inside, it is late and the last thing we need is for someone to take pictures of you out here.\" We both laughed lightly as we thought back to the last time that happened. We walked back inside and Ethan immediately ran up to her. My heart started beating faster as I watched the interaction between the two. Her face had the smile on it that I had been missing for the past two years and all of a sudden I felt complete again, even if it was just for that moment. She looked at me as she pet the top of his head. I cannot begin to explain how big the smile on my face was in that moment. As soon as I let myself enjoy it, the moment was over and we were both left standing there inside my house. Ethan continued to look at Jackie with his tail wagging at full speed. \"I…\" She paused again. I could tell she had not fully thought through why she was here. \"I needed to see you. My entire body has been on edge since I saw you earlier tonight and I needed to see you again.\" \"Jackie…\" \"You never called.\" I was surprised by the statement. \"Neither did you.\" \"I miss you, Catherine.\" \"Why are you here, Jackie?\" \"I told you, I needed to see you after earlier. This is my world, this is where I live and you just show up out of nowhere on a date with one of my bosses. I never thought I would see you again.\" She sounded upset. \"Abigail and Daniel set us up. It was a good opportunity to meet someone.\" \"So you won't be seeing him again?\" \"I really do not see how that is any of your business.\" She looked down after my snark remark. \"Do you want something to drink?\" I asked as I made my way to the kitchen on a mission to find the first bottle of wine. \"Water would be nice.\" \"The cups are up there, there is a pitcher in the refrigerator.\" I rested my hands on the counter and took a deep breath. I felt her close behind me and lost all feeling in my limbs when I felt her hands on my hips and her head rested on my back. \"Catherine…\" She whispered. I stood motionless. \"Why did you leave, Jackie?\" I finally asked. \"Huh?\" I felt her lift her head off of my back and I was able to breathe again. \"That last night, why did you leave?\" \"If I didn't leave, I would have never left… I didn't want to.\" \"We…\" She cut me off before I could even formulate a sentence. \"Don't say that, we both know it is not true.\" She knew me too well. I took this as an opportunity to turn around and face her. She put a hand up to my face and wiped away a tear that had formed. She took the glass of wine out of my hand. \"You don't really need that.\" \"You were different, you know.\" \"Huh?\" \"You asked me one day if you were different from the others and I wasn't ready to admit that you were.\" I was hoping that she wouldn't inquire further. \"What have you done the last two years? I don't think I have ever really gotten over the guilt that I felt for being the reason you lost your position.\" She looked down and I could see the sadness painted across her face. \"Whoa, do not think for a minute that was your fault.\" My eyes widened to emphasize the fact that it was in no way her fault for my termination. \"I knew what I was doing, I knew the consequences… I knew that…\" I stopped to think if I really wanted to say what was about to come out of my mouth. \"I knew that you were worth it.\" She looked back up at me with a weak smile. \"You didn't seem to think that I was worth the distance though.\" \"Jackie…\" I sighed as the dejection was written across my face. \"I travelled. I went to Spain and Thailand, France, Italy, Greece, Germany, England, China, Japan… I went all over. I met some incredible people along the way, who taught me lessons that I would have never learned.\" I answered her previous question in hopes that she would forget about the present question. \"What about you?\" \"You were always good at changing the subject, Dr. Stark.\" She smiled and accepted that I did not want to answer the question at that moment. \"I have been working… I don't know if you saw the Neptune movie or not, but it did really well. I never really thought I would get back into acting, but this is where I belong. This is my passion.\" \"And Chris?\" I had wanted to ask since she mentioned it at dinner earlier. I could not tell if I was jealous or actually curious. \"Is that really any of your business?\" She laughed. \"He's just a friend. It looks good in the press if we are dating. We are good friends, but that's it. I haven't really had the time to date anyone since I have been out here.\" \"Since when do you care what people think?\" I was surprised at her answer about Chris. That was not the Jacqueline Kirk that I knew. I think she was stunned by the question because she backed away and sat down at the table. \"The studio thought it would be a good idea, especially once the movie gets released next week.\" \"Next week?\" \"Yes, next week. We have the LA premiere this Thursday and then next Wednesday we are in New York and then London the following week.\" The premiere that Samuel had invited me to was for the movie he had produced with Jackie in it. Fantastic. How do I tell her that I am going to be there with her boss? I don't actually owe her an explanation, but at the same time, she holds my heart. Even if she does not know it, she still holds my heart. \"Oh.\" Was all I could say. \"For some reason the way you said that makes me think that you may have already known about the premiere on Wednesday…\" \"Samuel asked me if I wanted to go with him…\" \"So you will be seeing him again.\" \"Jackie…\" \"Catherine, it's fine. You and I were two years ago. I want you to be happy.\" I stopped for a moment as I saw the hurt on her face. \"I want the same for you, Jackie. You have no idea.\" She didn't say anything in return as we stood there in the darkness of the kitchen. \"You know, he has never attached to anyone the way he does to you.\" I spoke softly referring to Ethan who was lying at Jackie's feet. \"I definitely missed him. I remember sitting on the couch with him when you were helping me write my essay. He has always had a calming effect over me.\" \"He does that for me too. Just so you know, I didn't know it was your premiere that he invited me to.\" \"It's okay. Like I said, I want you to be happy.\" It stayed quiet for a few moments before I broke the silence. \"What made you come out here to teach?\" \"I did my undergrad out here and I really enjoy California. I applied for the position over a year ago, but it took a little while for it all to work out. It's doesn't hurt that they have one of the best Psych programs in the country.\" Or that you were out here. I kept that last part to myself because I really wanted to try and see if I could do this without clinging to her the first moment she appeared, each moment she stood in front of me told me that this would be harder than I ever imagined. \"I'm glad you moved away from Bloomington. You are so much more than a small town professor, you'll have so many more opportunities out here for your research and writing.\" \"Small town professor?\" \"You are insanely intelligent, Catherine. I don't think you give yourself enough credit sometimes. You are meant to be at a school like UCLA.\" I looked down at my watch and realized how late it was getting. \"I should go though. It's getting really late.\" \"Why don't you stay? I'll set up the guest room for you.\" \"Thank you, but I'll just drive home.\" \"Jackie, stay. It's late.\" \"Okay…\" I could see her take a deep breath before agreeing to my request. We walked upstairs and I grabbed her shorts and tee shirt to sleep in. I set her up in the guest room and we said good night. \"Here are these, so you don't have to sleep in your clothes. If you need anything else, just let me know.\" \"Thank you, Catherine.\" \"Good night, Jackie.\" \"Night.\" I turned to leave for my room and Ethan jumped up on Jackie's bed. \"Come on Ethan…\" He didn't move. \"It's okay if he stays in here. We can catch up.\" \"Are you sure?\" She just nodded and I turned to leave. I sat down on the edge of my bed and put my head in my hands. I couldn't believe that she was right down the hall from me, in my house… How did we get to this point? Why did we let things fall apart in the end? Why didn't either of us try to stop each other from creating this mess? I got into bed and laid there, staring at the ceiling. I was not going to be able to sleep tonight. After two years all it took was seeing her for all of the emotions I tried to push aside to come flooding back. By six I was downstairs making myself coffee. I heard Ethan coming downstairs followed by soft footsteps. I think Jackie was surprised to see me up because she looked like she had planned to skip out without saying goodbye. \"Oh – good morning.\" She said softly. \"Morning. You are up early.\" \"I could say the same to you…\" \"I couldn't sleep.\" \"Ha, me neither.\" \"Did Ethan keep you warm?\" My attempt at small talk was disappointing. \"Yes, he did.\" \"Good… Are you busy today?\" \"Yes… Interviews and press for the movie. You?\" \"Setting up my office and some teaching stuff.\" The silence between us was deafening. \"Catherine…\" \"Yeah?\" \"Can we try to be friends?\" I was surprised at the question and to be perfectly honest, I was not sure how to answer her. I was still debating on whether or not I should kiss her. The idea of a friendship with Jackie was scary because I knew that more time around her would make every thing so much harder. When had either of us ever been able to be \"friends?\" Even after we ended things we still found our way into my bed one last time before she left. \"Sure.\" I spoke softly and the words confused me as they came out of my mouth. \"I'd like that.\" \"Good. I'm going to get going, but I'll see you Thursday.\" She walked over towards me and we both stood there awkwardly before she wrapped me in a gentle hug. The small action surprised me. \"Yeah, Thursday…\" I said breathlessly. A/N – I apologize that this has taken so long. Life has been hectic and writer's block has found it's way into my brain. I had started the chapter last summer but never got around to finishing it. If there is anyone that is still reading this, thank you. I hope you enjoy. Feedback is always appreciated.[Chapter 4] A/N: It's been a loooonnnngggg time. If there is anyone still out there - I hope you enjoy the new chapter. Sincere apologies for the nearly six year wait. I don't write so much anymore, but I'm trying to get back into it. Tuesday and Wednesday seemed to drag on as I tried to keep Jackie out of my head. I attempted to stay focused on getting my curriculums ready for my courses, but every time I started something new my mind wandered to memories of when we were together. I had to be honest to myself, I have never felt the way I did about Jackie for anyone else, not before her and well, there had not been anyone after her. I know that I need to continue to move on, but I was not fooling myself thinking that Samuel would help with that. He was very nice, successful, charming, intelligent and could offer me the world, but something was missing. I hate to admit it, but seeing Jackie changed everything for me. My phone rang, pulling me away from my thoughts. \"Hello?\" \"Catherine, it's Samuel.\" \"How are you?\" \"Good, I'm just on a little break right now at work, but I wanted to let you know that I set up an appointment with my personal shopper for you to get an outfit for tonight.\" \"You don't need to do that, I was just going to wear something that I already have.\" \"Nonsense. There should be a car to pick you up at two and Monica will take you shopping and then to get your hair and make-up done.\" \"Wow, thank you. That is really sweet of you, Samuel.\" \"Not a problem. I look forward to seeing you tonight.\" I paused for a moment before responding. \"Same, I'll see you this evening.\" \"Bye Catherine.\" \"Bye Samuel.\" He was a very sweet guy and that phone call was just another way he showed that. I feel bad that I'm going to have to let him down, but he is too nice. He deserves someone who is going to fall in love with him and not have anyone else on their mind. The afternoon flew by and I found myself sitting in the back seat of a jet-black sedan holding hands with Samuel. He had a permanent smile on his face and I looked out the window wondering how the night was going to go. I knew I was going to see Jackie, which made me happy, but at the same time things were awkward. Two years without any communication would do that though. When the car stopped he got out and came around to open my door. He took my arm and led the way. Even thought it was evening you wouldn't be able to tell with all the lights flashing and bright lights lining the 'red carpet.' I smiled softly as people took pictures of us and I instantly felt uncomfortable. \"You okay?\" He asked. \"Yeah, I'm good.\" \"I'm going to have to take pictures for a little bit. If you want to go ahead and get a drink inside you are more than welcome to.\" I nodded my head and responded, \"I'm okay for now.\" \"Samuel!\" I heard her voice despite the press yelling around us. \"Jackie and Chris! We are going to take some photos with the cast before going in.\" When I turned around her and her 'boyfriend' were behind me. \"Hi again. It's Cathleen, right?\" She said and winked at me. \"Catherine.\" I corrected her. I knew she was trying to be funny, but I was jealous seeing her with Chris. She's the only one who ever made me feel that way. \"Right, sorry. This is Chris.\" She introduced us and I smiled politely and he seemed like he lacked a few brain cells and I wondered how Jackie could stand that. We both shook hands and said hello. \"Samuel, I think I'm going to wait for you inside. Can I get you a drink?\" \"I'm good for right now. Thanks, though. Abigail is probably inside, she hates this stuff.\" He said referring to the pomp and circumstance of the red carpet. \"Great. It was nice to meet you Chris. I'll see you guys inside.\" I smiled and turned to walk inside. I finally found my way inside and grabbed a red wine at the bar. I found Abigail and we made small talk until Daniel and Samuel joined us. Shortly before the movie started I excused myself to find a bathroom. There was a short line when I got there, but I didn't want to risk having to go during the movie. \"You look beautiful.\" She spoke softly so only I could hear her, but her breath on my neck instantly caused goosebumps. I turned to look at her and she had this small smirk on her face, like she knew exactly what she just did. \"Thank you. You do too.\" \"Are you free at all this weekend?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"I was hoping to maybe come over and see Ethan before I leave on Sunday for a couple of weeks.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"New York and then London, I told you the other day.\" \"Oh… yeah, I'm free this weekend.\" \"Great. I'll stop by.\" \"Jackie, you can't just stop by… At least call beforehand, in case I have visitors.\" \"Right, sorry. I'll call before I come over. I think you're up.\" \"Huh?\" I was confused. \"The bathroom is open.\" \"Of course.\" The night went smoothly and the movie was pretty good. I was diagonally behind Jackie during the viewing and on occasion I caught her looking back to see if I was enjoying it. When we went to leave Samuel held my hand as we made our way back to the car. \"I made a reservation for dinner at this little Italian place.\" \"Great, I'm starving.\" \"Me too!\" He laughed. We had a nice night, much like the first night he took care of everything, but there just wasn't a spark. I hope he doesn't think that there is, because I'm awful at ending things with people. And he is nice, so nice. After dinner, we were in the back of the car sitting there quietly. He lightly squeezed my hand before he started talking. \"Catherine... Did you have a good time tonight?\" \"Yes, I did. It was very nice.\" \"That's it though, just nice…\" I looked at him strangely. \"Don't get me wrong. I've really enjoyed spending time with you, but I think we are both on the same page that this probably isn't going to go anywhere.\" I instantly felt like a weight had been lifted. \"I have had fun, but I feel the same way.\" \"Abigail is always trying to set me up and it's sweet, but I'm just not in a place to really be dating.\" \"I know the feeling. I just got out here and have a lot on my plate getting ready for the fall semester.\" \"You're a good date though, Catherine. I might have to call on you if I'm ever dateless to an event.\" \"You aren't so bad yourself. I'd be okay with that.\" I laughed. We talked a bit more on the way back to my place and he walked me to my door when we arrived at my house. We hugged good night. I knew I'd probably see him again, but was happy with how things ended this evening. As always, Ethan was waiting for me at the door. He followed me upstairs as I took my shoes off and soon after the beautiful dress I was wearing. I changed into something comfortable and took my phone out of my bag. I noticed that Jackie had texted me about thirty minutes earlier. Porcupine: Would now be a bad time to come visit Ethan? Catherine: Jackie, really? Porcupine: It's fine if the answer is no. Catherine: I just got home. I'm about to take him for a walk. Porcupine: Is that a yes? Catherine: Are you going to stay over again? Porcupine: Probably not. Catherine: I'll see you when you get here. I smiled at the exchange, but I also knew that I needed to slow down. I told myself I wouldn't run to her the first chance I got. I've only been here three weeks. At the same time, why should I waste more time? It's been two years. Ethan and I went out for a walk around the neighborhood and when we returned home she was sitting in front of the front door. \"You didn't waste much time.\" \"I don't live very far from here.\" \"Oh… You didn't mention that before.\" \"I didn't want to freak you out.\" \"When you say not very far, what do you mean?\" \"We're practically neighbors.\" \"Wow. Of all the places…\" \"I thought the same, but it's not a big deal.\" \"Hmm.\" I opened the door for us. \"I wondered how you got past the gate the other night.\" \"I'm in the next community over, but I have friends in this one, so I have a guest pass.\" \"I'll have to talk to the guard next time about limiting your access.\" I laughed. \"Oh yeah?\" She said sarcastically. She grabbed for my hand and pulled me closer to her. We both took a deep breath at the same time and I pushed a piece of hair behind her ear. She wrapped her arms around my waist and rested her head on me. \"I still can't believe you're here. I honestly didn't think I'd ever see you again.\" \"I knew you were out here, but I was going to work up the courage to get in touch with you. Just to see how you were doing.\" \"Really? \"I don't know how long it would have taken, but it doesn't matter much at this point.\" I ran my fingers through her hair and one hand was gently rubbing her back. \"Can we sit on the couch?\" She just nodded and we pulled apart. When we sat on the couch she curled up beside me and put an arm across my front as one of my arms draped over her shoulder. \"This is almost too easy.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"How we fit together, like no time has passed.\" \"Jackie…\" \"I'm serious. It's like we were always meant to be right here in this moment. Look, we haven't seen each other in over two years. You've traveled around the world. I've traveled around the world. But yet, we were both in the right place at the right time the other night. Don't you think its fate?\" She is sitting up now, holding one of my hands and staring at me as if I am the only person in the world. \"We would have run into each other at the premiere.\" \"Exactly. It was inevitable.\" \"We can only be friends.\" I said softly. \"Why would you say that?\" \"Because in reality nothing has changed. You are now a big star, bigger than two years ago. Are you ready to risk that?\" \"You were worth it then. You're worth it now.\" \"Don't say things you don't mean.\" \"Why do you think I'm here?\" \"Huh?\" \"Why do you think that I showed up here the other night and tonight?\" \"Because a blast from your past popped up out of nowhere.\" \"That's part of it.\" \"What's the other part?\" \"That I never stopped thinking about you.\" \"You never called.\" \"Neither did you.\" \"I'm not sitting here telling you that I didn't stop thinking about you.\" \"You don't need to.\" \"There it is again! Do they teach that type of narcissism out here? You just assume you know what I want and what I'm thinking!\" I stood up and threw my hands in the air. \"Here we go. A gross over reaction to keep me an arm's length away. We haven't seen this before. You just said to me you knew I was out here and you were going to contact me, but you didn't want it to be the first thing you did.\" \"You should leave.\" I was starting to get upset. I wanted to prove to myself that she wasn't the reason I came here. Pushing her away was the only way I could lie to myself. She was calling my bluff though. \"Where did that get us the last time, Catherine? It's been over two years and here we are. Single. Alone. Easily falling into something that never should have ended.\" \"It had to end. You were leaving.\" \"You could have come with me.\" She stood up from the couch and just stared at me. She looked deflated. \"You live in a world where you have to pretend to date your co-star because it will help the box office numbers. There isn't room for me in that world.\" \"And I'm telling you I am willing to make room for you in that world, because I need you in mine.\" With that she walked towards the door. She turned back to look at me one more time before she walked out the front entry. \"When you're done wasting time, you know how to reach.\" ","Summary":" Author's Note: I have not posted on here in years. I lost all of my creativity juices long ago and "},{"Movie":"Bloomington","Title":"Buring the Candle at Both Ends","Author":"greystone2009","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9331135","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I don't own anything! So I'm pretending that the ending of the movie didn't happen in this fic! Finals are coming up and Jackie is having a hard time juggling everything. Will Catherine help or make things worse? Jackie's eyes slowly fluttered opened and in an instant she knew something was wrong. Was there normally this much sun light coming through her window in the morning? She grabbed her phone and yelled, 'shit' when she saw that it was 8:50am. Her first class started at 9am and she couldn't be late to her psych class. She knew if she was late she would for sure be lectured by Catherine. She wasn't normally one for skipping class or not doing her homework, but she did occasionally skip her geography class to try and get caught up on other homework. As she rushed to her class she looked at her phone, not surprisingly she had three unread texts, both from the professor she would be seeing soon. The first one read: 7:30 am 'Good morning porcupine, can't wait to see your face in class' This made Jackie smile as she hustled to get to class. 8:00 am 'I hope you're not planning on skipping my class Miss Kirk' 8:45am 'Seriously? I better see you class!' Jackie ran the rest of the way to class and stopped when she got to the door, luckily the door had a little window on it and she could see in and she noticed that even though it was 9:05 students weren't fully seated yet. Maybe she could get away with it. She quickly walked in and found her usual seat by her friends. As she sat down she caught the eye of her professor who mouthed the words, 'you're late.' Jackie just sheepishly mouthed back, 'sorry.' Normally the young student was hooked on every word that Catherine said during lecture, but today she found herself doodling in her notebook just to stay awake. Jackie was just praying to get through the hour and fifteen minute lecture so she could go to the coffee shop and get some caffeine before her next class. Finally, she heard those words that all students love to hear, \"Ok class that wraps it up for today, see you Thursday.\" She knew she should talk to Catherine and explain why she hadn't responded to her texts but she only had a few minutes before her next class. She tried to sneak out with her friends when she heard, \"Miss Kirk, may I have a word with you?\" Of course she got a look from all her friends that said, 'glad it's you and not me' and before her one friend left, she asked, \"So we'll see you for study group tonight right?\" Jackie had to think for a second, \"Uh yeah that should be fine.\" Jackie walked over to her professor's desk and quietly watched as she was putting her papers away. \"What's up?\" Jackie finally said growing impatient. \"Are you ok? You're never late for class, even by just a few minutes.\" Jackie took a deep breath trying not to get frustrated. She knew that Catherine only had her best interests at heart, but in this moment she didn't feel like being lectured. \"Yea I'm fine, I just overslept. I would love to stay and chat, but I need to get going otherwise I'm going to be late for another class.\" She started to walk away when she felt Catherine's hand on her arm. \"Jackie...\" Jackie cut her off before she could finish her sentence, \"Catherine, really I'm fine. I'll call you later.\" With that she took off to the coffee shop. On her brisk walk there she suddenly felt bad for being so short with Catherine. After she ordered her drink she decided to send her a text to apologize. I'm sorry about that. I'm just really tired. Chat later? She heard her name called and walked up to get her coffee, she only had 6 minutes to get to her next class. Thankfully she made it to her seat just as her professor was walking into the classroom. The caffeine was starting to kick and she began writing notes. About half way through the lecture she saw her phone light up with a message. She instantly smiled, hoping it was from Catherine. I just worry about you :) Of course, want to stop by my office after 4? It was the week before finals and time was very precious, but so was Catherine. Jackie was having a hard time balancing everything right now, friends, studying and Catherine. She desperately just wanted to be with her girlfriend, all curled up on the couch enjoying a drink and each other, but that would all have to wait till after finals. After a few minutes of debating how to fit everything in, she finally responded. I can stop by for a few minutes. I've got a lab till 4 and a group meeting at 4:30. Sounds great, see you then. The rest of the day went by pretty quick, during her break she spent time in the library working on a study guide for her Geography final. During her lab, she tried to get done as soon as possible so she could head over to see Catherine. She hated that her time was so limited. She texted Catherine to let her know she would be there a few minutes early. When she got to Catherine's office the door was closed. Since they were on campus she tried be as discreet as possible. \"Professor Stark?\" She knocked on the door and waited for an answer. \"Doors open, come in.\" She opened the door and saw the pretty blonde sitting behind her desk working on papers. Catherine quickly stood up and walked over to Jackie. Just as Jackie closed the door she was swept up in a hug by Catherine. Jackie just relished the moment with a huge grin on her face. When the two finally separated, Jackie said, \"Thanks, I needed that. Today has been crazy and it's not even over yet.\" She walked over to the couch that was in the office and sat down. Catherine just smiled and walked over and sat next to her. \"Just so you know, it sounds very sexy when you say 'Professor Stark.' Jackie just gave small smile back to the professor. \"You seemed pretty stressed earlier. Have you eaten today?\" It was simple question, yet Jackie had to do some serious thinking to answer the question. \"Um….yes…wait…no. I just haven't had the time. I typically eat after Stats class, but I was in the library instead.\" Suddenly Jackie's eyes were feeling very heavy, even though she had just finished her second cup of coffee. Catherine gave her the 'I'm about to give you a lecture' look when Jackie intervened. \"I know, I know, I'll eat after my group meeting and before my study group.\" \"No, you're going to eat something now, you have some time before your group meeting.\" Jackie knew better than to argue with Catherine and just nodded as she stood up. \"How about a turkey sandwich?\" \"Ok, sure. Thanks\" With that Catherine was gone. For the second time today Jackie woke up oddly confused, she vaguely heard her phone go off and wondered what time it was. She about had a heart attack when she saw that it was 4:45pm. No wonder she woke up to texts asking where she was. \"Holy shit! Catherine, did you know what time it was? Why didn't you wake me?\" Jackie was scrambling to get her things ready and walk out the door. \"You need sleep, you can only burn the candle at both ends for so long babe. Take a deep breath, sit down, eat your sandwich. You're fine.\" \"Are you kidding me? I'm already 15 minutes late to my group meeting. They are probably pissed off, I've got to go.\" Jackie ran off and all but slammed the door on her way out. As always, let me know what you think! Not sure how many chapters this will be. Maybe 3 or 4![Chapter 2] A/N: Thanks for the favorites/follows and what not! I appreciate it. This chapter is a bit shorter. Sorry. Jackie didn't even bother sending her group a text letting her know she was on her way. She just made a mad dash across campus and into the library where she found her group in one of the corners of the library. \"Hey guys, I'm so sorry I'm late. What can I do to help with the project?\" She was hoping that if she offered to do a bit more on the project they would forgive her for her tardiness. After some discussion and delegating different parts of the paper Jackie offered to be the one who was in charge up putting the paper together and getting it professionally printed before the due date. She really didn't want to be stuck doing that, but she felt bad for being so late and it needed to get done. Truth be told, she really didn't trust any of her other group members to do it. When she walked out of the meeting she ran through a mental chick list of things she still needed to do. Her 'to do' list was quite long, but there wasn't anything that needed to be done at that moment. She wanted to work on her study guide and get some notes ready for tomorrow, but she decided that could wait until she had dinner. As she was walking back to her dorm she received a text from Catherine, ' You should come over after your group meeting, I have food :)'. Jackie grinned and the thought of being able to spend time with Catherine tonight made her practically run to her house. As she was on her way, she sent a text back letting her know that she was on her way and that she was starving. When she was getting closer to the house she was suddenly feeling guilty for the way she had acted earlier. Jackie was normally a pretty level headed person, but the stress of everything was just starting to build up. She was passing by some rose bushes and decided to pick a few, hoping the small gesture would be accepted by Catherine. Jackie was greeted at the front door by Ethan and followed the amazing smell of roasting chicken into the kitchen. \"Hey, how was your meeting?\" Catherine looked up from the cutting board and asked Jackie. \"Long, boring, pretty much the usual.\" Jackie responded and walked around the island to properly greet Catherine. \"Do you want a sa\" Catherine was cut off when Jackie put her hands on the older woman's face, leaned in and kissed her. Jackie wrapped her arms around Catherine's neck and hugged her as tightly as possible. \"I'm sorry about today. I've just been so stressed out. I know I shouldn't take it out on you.\" \"I know Jacks, it's that time of the semester, things get crazy. But please know that I'm only trying to help. In hindsight, I should have woken you up for your meeting. I'm sorry too.\" The timer went off and Catherine went and pulled the chicken out of the oven. Jackie put the flowers in a vase and poured some wine for the two of them. They made small talk as they ate dinner. Jackie stood up from the table and starting clearing the dishes. \"Don't worry about those, I can do them later\" Catherine responded as she took her plate to the sink. Jackie nodded and asked \"ok, I'm going to make some coffee, do you want any?\" \"Really? It's almost 8pm? Are you sure you want to caffeine this late?\" Catherine cared a lot about Jackie, she never wanted to seem controlling. But sometimes it came across that way. \"Yeah, I've got a list of things I want to work on, and I need caffeine to do that\" Jackie said as she kissed Catherine on the cheek. \"My first class isn't until 10am tomorrow, so I can work on some things tonight, and still get some sleep before starting again tomorrow.\" \"Are you going to do your studying here or go back to the library?\" Catherine asked while starting to do the dishes. \"Well I was just thinking of doing them here, if that's ok. You don't have to be on campus till 9 tomorrow right?\" \"Yup, I've got class at 9 then office hours after\" Catherine started to explain before Jackie came over and wrapped her arms around her waist. \"You know, the coffee takes a while to percolate….\" Jackie said in between placing kisses on Catherine's neck. \"Hmmm…I wonder how we could kill some time?\" Catherine grinned. Please let me know what you think! Also, I'm looking for a beta reader. If anyone has any suggestions let me know! Thanks![Chapter 3] A/N: Wow, I'm so sorry I abandoned this! But thank you SOOOO much to the people who have recently liked it! Here's another chapter, I'm hoping for another one quite soon! As always, I don't own anything! The two blondes were wrapped in each other's arms on the couch. Jackie knew full well that the coffee was done but she just couldn't leave the warmth of Catharine's arms. Finally, Catherine slowly started to move and said, \"it's nearly 8:30pm, you have studying to do and I have papers to grade.\" Jackie just let out a tired moan and got up as well. \"Finals need to be over! I'm tired of studying all the time!\" Catherine put her arms out to offer to help Jackie up and said, \"they will be soon babe, before you know it. As soon as they are over we'll do something fun to celebrate!\" She kissed the younger blonde on the forehead and pointed her in the direction of the coffee. Around 11pm Catherine looked over to see Jackie still dutifully studying, pen in one hand and highlighter in the other. \"How about you take a break for the night and come to bed?\" \"I was thinking about heading back to my dorm soon, I want to get up and go for a run in the morning and I need my stuff.\" Jackie said as she let out a yawn. \"Jacks, its after 11, stay here; you can wear my workout clothes in the morning if you really want to go for a run. Plus, my bed is much closer than yours!\" Catherine said with a slight smirk. It didn't really take much convincing to get Jackie to spend the night, Catherine was pretty sure Jackie was asleep before her head hit the pillow. The older blonde wrapped her arms around Jackie and for a moment reminisced about her time in college and preparing for finals. They were always such a nerve racking time, so many projects to complete, group meetings to attend, and study guides to make. She was just hoping that Jackie wouldn't overdue and push herself to far. The professor was trying to walk a fine line between being too protective and helping Jackie. She knew Jackie felt a lot of pressure to do well in school and prove that she wasn't just some actress trying to skate through college. Jackie was smart, but always wanted to do her best. Catherine set her alarm and drifted off to sleep with a slight smile on her face as she slept next to her girlfriend. An alarm went off and 7am and Catherine rolled over to find Jackie all ready lacing up her shoes. \"Wow, you actually are going for a run.\" Catherine said, frankly surprised that she actually was able to wake up on time. \"Yeah, I woke thinking about study guides and projects and couldn't fall back asleep so I figured I would just go get my run done.\" \"Well do you want to come back here after, I could make breakfast.\" \"No that's ok. I'm going to drop my backpack off at my dorm then go run. The coffee shop will be open so I'll just grab something.\" She leaned over gave Catherine a quick kiss and started to head out. \"Thanks again for dinner last night!\" Before Catherine could even say something about eating something more nutritious than a croissant, Jackie was gone. When Jackie made it to her dorm, she grabbed her iPod, switched to her favorite running shoes instead of the ones she borrowed from Catherine and headed out. The campus was so beautiful and she loved running through it early in the morning. Most students didn't start coming to life until 8:30 if they had a 9am class, so the campus was relatively student free. As she started her run she tried her best to clear her head off all things school related. So of course, her thoughts were left to Catherine, the beautiful professor who captured her heart not too long ago. She was so thankful that they had made it through the semester without anyone finding out their relationship. She really did work for her grades and she didn't want anyone to think otherwise. Sure, she had some inside tips on some things, but even Catherine wouldn't give her hints on tests. As she started to hit her stride, doubt crept in, and she couldn't help but think what if someone finds out about them. She had already signed up for another class Catherine was teaching next semester, but now she was thinking about switching it to another professor, or dropping the class all together. She loved Catherine dearly, but didn't want to jeopardize her career. All she wanted to do was spend all her time with Catherine, but she also thought about joining a club on campus. She really wanted the full college experience while she was there. Plus, she had started to develop a friendship with one of the girls from her study group and was worried she might accidently say something about Catherine that would give them away. She tried to shake those thoughts as she made her way back to the dorm. Once finals were over she would have to talk to Catherine about that. After her shower and repacking her bag for the things she would need for the day she headed to the coffee shop to get her favorite coffee and a bagel. As a joke she took a picture of the bagel and texted it to Catherine, \"Breakfast of Champions! :) Jackie knew that Catherine was a bit of a stickler when it came to eating healthy meals, and sometimes Jackie liked to tease her about it. A/N: What do you think of Jackie's doubts? Will it all work out?! :) Thoughts are always much appreciated![Chapter 4] A/N: So there isn't a lot of dialouge in this one, sorry in advance. Just kind of what's going through Jackie's head and such. A little bit more angst :) Let me know what you think! As always, I don't own anything! Catherine was just getting to her office when her phone buzzed. She couldn't help but chuckle when she saw the picture. Of course Jackie would eat a bagel, even though there were healthier options, but once again Catherine just chalked it up to finals week. She decided to text back, \"Ya know that they have fruit and granola right?! :) Have a good day, see you tonight?\" Catherine hit send and was hoping that she would get to see the younger blonde later. They hadn't made any plans for it and with finals week their semi regular routine had been all messed up. She put her phone on silent and headed to her first class of the day. She had told her students she would be there a few minutes early to discuss any questions they had. This particular class only had more meeting before the final and she knew her students were nervous about the test. Jackie decided to stay in the coffee shop and study there instead of heading to the library. Her class was closer to the coffee shop anyway. As she was making notecards she got Catherine's text about getting together. She opened up her planner, which had been such a lifesaver these last couple of weeks. Class at 10 Group meeting at 12 Class at 3 Group meeting at 8 Hmmmm…..she hated how late the last group meeting was, but trying to coordinate 5 students schedules was very challenging. She was thankful that she didn't have to work crazy hours like some students had to, although she knew that it kind of separated her from the other students as well. Sure there were some kids whose parents paid for everything and they didn't have to work, but Jackie was different, she was an actress who was now trying to live the life of a student. She thought about getting a part time job, but it was times like this she was thankful she didn't have one. After a few minutes of thinking she texted Catherine back, \" I would love to see your pretty face, I just don't know when that will be :( today is just so crazy\" She hit send and went back to studying, it was almost 9am and she knew that Catherine would probably already be in class and wouldn't respond until her class was done. Catherine was so happy to be out of her morning class. She loved her students, but finals took its toll on professors as well. She had to repeat the same things 3 times to one student, who she was pretty sure had only shown up to class about 5 times over the course of the semester. As she was walking out of the classroom she went to get her phone out of her bag when she was stopped by another student who had one more question. Finally, she said goodbye to the student and continued on her way to her office. She pulled her phone out and smiled when she saw she had a text, but quickly lost that smile when she read the last part of the text. She tried to think of how she could squeeze in a little time with her favorite person. \" How about I fix you dinner? 7pm?\" Catherine hit send and kept walking to her office. Unlike her girlfriend, Jackie usually kept her phone out during class, depending on the class of course. She was sitting in her last lecture of her geography class with her notebook open and her phone on the desk. It was a large class and she wasn't worried about getting in trouble. Her phone lit up and she quickly read the message from Catherine. She quietly sighed as she read it. Dinner at 7 wouldn't leave her much time to get back to her group meeting at 8. She immediately thought back to her run this morning and the doubts she had. If she was dating anyone else, they could meet up wherever and whenever they wanted. They could go to the pizza shop that was just a block from the school. They could hang out in her dorm or even eat in the cafeteria on campus. Unfortunately, Catherine wasn't just anyone, she was a professor. And even though you occasionally saw professors and students mingling in a coffee shop or the pizza place downtown, Catherine wasn't a normal professor. She had a reputation, if any student saw her with another student rumors would start flying and Jackie didn't want that to be her. Jackie decided that it was best to just not see Catherine again today. She texted back, \"I don't think that is going to work, maybe tomorrow?\" She knew that Catherine was probably going to be disappointed, but she really wanted to focus on finals and not secretly running around campus trying to hide the fact she was dating a professor. She debated a second before sending it…was she being too harsh? It wasn't Catherine's fault she was a professor, Jackie knew she should just talk to Catherine, but she was scared and worried what Catherine's response would be. She finally hit send and decided to put her phone in her backpack and focus on class. Catherine was working on creating the final for one of her classes when she got the text from Jackie. She was slightly confused when Jackie didn't want to get together for dinner. Granted, she knew she was busy with finals and didn't know what her schedule was. But usually, Jackie came over every chance she got. \" Everything ok? We can change the time if you want. Let me know ! ;)\" Catherine hit send hoping she could somehow see Jackie later. Jackie sat in class, paying attention and taking notes and had no idea that her phone just went off. A/N: Ok, what did you guys think? Do you think that Jackie will finally tell Catherine what she's feeling? How will Catherine respond? Let me know your thoughts![Chapter 5] A/N: So originally I think I said it would be 3 or 4 chapters...well this is Chap 5! Haha. I think I've got a couple more chapters in me. Let me know what you think. I don't own anything! After class Jackie headed straight for the library to reserve a table for her group meeting. They library was always packed during finals week and finding a table was always a struggle. Once she found an open spot, she went to the vending machines that were located on the first floor of the library to get a water bottle. When she sat back at the table she reached for her phone so she could text her group and let them know where in the library she was. After sending out that text she read Catherine's text. She loved that fact that Catherine wanted to see her and was willing to make it work. But she still thought it would be best if she didn't see Catherine. She decided to wait until her meeting was over to text Catherine. Jackie wasn't much help during her group meeting, while they were talking finals and study guides she was thinking about Catherine. When the group meeting was finally over she decided to respond to the text Catherine back, \" Will you be in your office around 5pm?\" Even though she had thought about not going to see Catherine today, she knew that she just needed to get these thoughts off her chest so she could get back to being focused on finals. She quickly got a response from Catherine, \"If that works for you then I'll be there. Should I have coffee ready?\" Jackie almost broke down, Catherine was just always so thoughtful and of course she would have coffee ready for Jackie. \"Sure that would be great, I have class at 3. I'll see you after\" before she hit send she decided to add xo to the end of it. During her 3pm class, she was getting more and more stressed about talking to Catherine, she really needed to be focusing on the notes the professor was giving them for the final, but she kept thinking about Catherine. Finally her class was over and after talking with a few classmates about getting together to study she headed off for Catherine's office. As she rounded the corner in the hallway, she could hear voices coming from the professor's office. It was the week before finals, of course there would be students coming and going from professor's offices. She decided to wait in the hallway and pretended to be looking at a bulletin board when the other students came out of the office. When the students were safely out of site she walked through Catherine's door. Most students would sit in the chair that was next to Catherine's desk so that is what Jackie decided to do, even though the couch looked much more comfortable. She started pulling her psych notebook out just to be prepared if students walked in she could pretend to be asking a question. The older woman gave her a bit quizzical look and stood up to go close the door. Before she could get to the door though Jackie looked over and in a loud whisper said, \"You can't close the door, if another student comes in it'll look weird if you're in here with me and the door is closed.\" \"I'm sure it'll be fine. I technically don't have office hours right now anyway, so no one will be coming\" Catherine simply stated as she walked over to the door. \"Please, just leave it open, I'll feel better about it.\" Jackie asked, trying not to seem so upset. Catherine paused for a second, and then decided to close the door anyway. \"I think it will look even more weird if a student see's me kissing you,\" she said with that classic Catherine smirk and walked over to Jackie who did was trying in vain not to be upset. Catherine reached out her arms to help Jackie out of the chair and gave her a big hug. She whispered into Jackie's ear, \"Everything is going to be fine.\" She pulled the younger blonde back just a bit so she could see her face. It was obvious that Jackie was still nervous about the situation. \"I love you Jaqueline, nothing is going to happen.\" Before Jackie could even respond Catherine leaned in and gently kissed the younger blondes lips. Jackie just started to ease up a bit when she heard students out in the hallway. She broke away and listened to see if she could hear what they were saying. All she could make out was, Professor Stark, final, and questions. \"Shit\" Jackie said as she grabbed her backpack and notes. As she quickly grabbed her bag and notebook she said loudly, \"Thanks for your help Professor Stark, I was a little confused by one of the study guides questions you had. Thanks!\" She opened the door right as she said 'thanks' and tried not to make eye contact with the 2 students who were just about to knock on the door. She was pretty sure she didn't recognize them, and just hoped that they didn't think too much of it. As she walked away she could her Catherine snap back to her professor role and say, \"what can I help you both with this evening, have a seat.\" Jackie walked as quickly as she could to the library; it was all she could do not to start crying on her way. If she had just stuck with her original plan none of that wouldn't have happened. That was way too close of a call for her and just put her even more on edge. They only reason she had decided go was so she could have talked to Catherine. Now she would have to wait till the weekend most likely. She made it to the ladies bathroom on the 3rd floor of the library; she knew hardly anyone ever used it. As soon as she made it to the sink the waterworks started and she didn't know how to stop it. She knew it was partly due to stress, she rarely got this upset. But she loved Catherine so much and she was just so worried about it ending due to someone finding out. After a few minutes she finally stopped crying and splashed some water on her face. Just as she was looking at her puffy face the door opened and Jackie put her head down and pretended to wash her hands hoping the girl wouldn't notice how red her eyes were. Unfortunately, the girl noticed and walked over. She simply said, \"finals are a bitch, don't worry, they'll be over soon.\" Jackie just smiled a bit and said thanks and walked out of the bathroom to try and find a table. Back in the professor's office she was just saying goodbye to the students who interrupted her moment with Jackie. She sat down at her desk and thought about what happened. Of course she was worried about what would happen if someone found out about the two of them, but she never really let it bother her. She truly did love Jackie and whatever happened they would deal with it at that time. She just wished she could find a way to make Jackie feel more relaxed. A/N: Let me know what you think. Any thoughts or comments! I've been thinking about taking a bit of a break from this one and doing the other fanfic I have for Bloomington, \"Holding on by a thin, thin thread.\" I've heard some songs that make we want to write, so we'll see. Anyway, thanks for the comments! They make me happy! :) ","Summary":" A/N: I don't own anything!

If font is in italics, it means a flashback or an event that hasn't taken place yet. I'll make it obvious. Jason had rules. However these rules were there for reasons. His job. A Transporter. But these rules weren't only to be abided, but, to be broken. Rule 1: The deal is NOT to be broken. Rule 2: Defiantly NO names. Rule 3: Whatever happens. Don't look in the package. Having been living by these rules, Jason made a mistake. A grave mistake. One that ultimately result to a breaking of these rules. Prelude: Future Events Jason sat admiring his new car, his Audi R8. After a successful transportation, he decided to treat himself with a new automobile. His old BMW 3-series had started to show signs of wear, and as technology was increasing, Jason felt change was needed. The Audi gleamed from the Service Station's lights and the 20inch alloys drew attention to a few onlookers. Showing signs of satisfaction, Jason took a munch into his cheese and tomato sandwich. It was starting to get late. Looking at his slick, titanium watch, it read 23:00pm. 'Shit, need to clean up and head off', Jason thought as he wiped his mouth with a cloth. Finishing his last bite, he looked up at his black Audi. Passerby's looked by with awe, and the odd person would take meaningless photos. Grinning, Jason took out his box of cigarettes and his playboy lighter. Putting the fag into his mouth, he was getting ready to light it when an Asian man shouted. \" Hey you, what you doing? Can't you read? No smoking dumb ass.\" Jason paused. His eyes slowly looked up at an Asian gentlemen sitting on the opposite table. His fag still in his mouth, Jason smirked. \" Who do you think your calling dumbass?\" Jason said keeping one eye on his car. \" You,\" the Chinese gentlemen said getting to his feet. In the corners of the room others started to get up and walk to the Chinese man's side. \" Hey, hey. I want no trouble in my store. If you gonna fight, take it outside,\" the checkout man said as he took out a shotgun from under the counter. \" Look. I don't need any difficulty,\" Jason said putting his hands up. The counter guy slowly put his shotgun down. The Chinese man smirked. \" Didn't think so.\" He clicked his stubby fingers and his men followed. Looking back at Jason, the Asian man uncovered a bit of his blazer to show an Uzi 21mm. Laughing, they took off in their green tuned Nissan Skyline's. The cars had overly installed vinyl's of howling wolfs and alloys slightly bigger then Jason's. The body work of the car showed excellent craftsmanship with the car's body lying quite low to the floor. Loud deafening music played from the car with the bass shaking Jason's seat. Starting the cars, blue neon lights lightened up from under the car and pulsed in time with the music. The three identical cars shot off with a cloud of smoke being the only thing left behind. Jerks Jason thought as he put his black camera pen in the inside of his leather jacket. Getting up from his table, Jason's mobile rang with the recognizable tune of mission impossible. \" Hello,\" Jason answered in his low, almost growling voice. \" Jason, with have just received highly important details for a delivery needed to be made by you,\" the caller said. The caller was unmistakably from MI5. She was Violet. A close friend to Jason, and she too was a transporter. In the whole field of MI5, there were only 4 transporters. These were people who have trained in MI5 and learnt the traits needed for being a Transporter. Trait number one. Strength. Trait number 2. Driving skills. Trait number 3. Intelligence Having all three of these attributes makes an incredible Transporter. A transporters job is to deliver information or packages to given destinations in a set time while abiding by rules. \" OK. Give me the details,\" Jason asked as he moved towards the counter to pay for his sandwich. \" A black bag weighing 12kg, 67cm in length and 34cm in width. Destination, Docks in New Port. Come to MI5 academy to receive the package. The rest of details will be told there\" replied Violet. \" OK. Thanks for the update,\" Jason put away his slick Razr2 into his jacket and took out some cash. Leaving the money on the counter, Jason departed out the service station and entered the cold night. The moon glistened in the night's sky. Not one cloud or star was seen. Taking out his car keys, Jason opened the doors to his Audi. They opened upwards and Jason entered the warm car, sitting on his leather seat. Closing the door, he pushed the ignition button, and the car roared into life then a calm sound of the engine was heard. He set off onto the quite, serene roads heading to the fisrt packages delivery first. Putting the radio on, Jason set the car to cruise control and winded down the windows feeling the fresh air flow through his short blonde hair. Passing under a tunnel, the radio stopped and sounds of monstrous engines could be heard behind the Audi. Looking to his side mirror, Jason saw the dreaded sight of three green Nissan Skylines. These bastards again. Shit was going down… Well that's the prelude to my first chapter I intended it to be short by the way.[Chapter 2] DISCLAIMER: The Transporter does not belong to me and belongs to it's respectful company.

If font is in italics, it means a flashback or an event that hasn't taken place yet. I'll make it obvious. The Chase 23:05. Jason couldn't afford to waste time but he knew that there was no other clear way of getting out. The piercing looks the Chinese men gave to Jason didn't look too promising, however Jason wasn't going down without a fight. He winded down his black tinted windows and levelled up to a Nissan to his right. \"Do you guy's have a problem?\" Jason asked with his almost growling voice. The Chinese man gave an evil smirk. \"You know what we want. You give it now, and there be no trouble,\" the man took out an Uzi and aimed it towards Jason. Jason gritted his teeth. What do these bastards want? He then instantly remembered. He looked down to the passenger seat and saw the black suitcase. He then met eyes with the man. \"I see,\" Jason's hand slowly lowered down into his compartment and flicked a red switch. A quiet whirring sound could be heard as the body of Jason's elegant Audi was covered in an unbreakable as was transparent coating. Jason gave himself a satisfied grin. A bullet-proof layer of glass had covered the car's black body. At least being with the MI5 had it's good points. Jason smirked then quickly braced himself in his seat. He tightly gripped his left hand onto the steering wheel and his right on the gear stick. He gave a quick glance to the Chinese man until he flashed him the finger and pressed hard onto the throttle. His engine roared through the empty tunnel and was soon followed by three others. Rapid gunshots could be heard from behind but it was to no avail. The bullets bounced off the car's body and onto the road. Jason looked at his watch, 23:07. As Jason rocketed out the tunnel, the radio blast into life again. Cringing by the shear intensity of the volume, Jason quickly switched it off and immediately pressed a round purple button. A clunk was heard. The license plate was changed from 'L348 AHA' to a more appropriate 'F0CK Y0U.' Grinning, Jason sped down a narrow street and quickly pulled onto the handbrake. The rear of the Audi span uncontrollably to the left, but Jason counter-steered and levelled up the car. Looking into the carbon fibre wind mirror he saw the three cars right behind him. They equally drifted much so like the Audi and caught up. More gunshots were heard but the glass easily stopped them. Jason tried shaking the cars off but they stuck like glue. A narrow alleyway lay ahead but with some pedestrians. Jason took the risk. He slammed his brakes and entered the quiet road. He zipped past pedestrians, mostly hookers or tramps and quickly turned to the right. As he soared through the streets at unnatural speeds a group of police caught up. Five Peugeot 105's joined into the pursuit. Holy shit, at this rate I'm gonna be late. Jason came up to a bridge. Bell's started to ring. Jason gave a quick glance to his right and saw a cargo ship approach.Jason gripped hard onto the steering wheel and changed rapidly into the next gear. His eyes showed clear determination. He had to lose this bastards. He pushed hard onto the throttle and kept his focus on the bridge. It was at a near 35°. Looking into his wind mirror he caught sight of the police but no the Nissans. Not having time to ponder over where they had gone, Jason approached the bridge. It was a risk, but he couldn't afford to be captured. It was nearly at 45° and Jason braced himself. He flew. As he soared thought the air, the tides below ripped fiercely. If Jason was to fall, it would end. However, landing cleaning, the Audi sufficed, and it elegant body was unharmed. Jason drifted the car to a halt and looked to see if he was followed. He paused. No sign of the police. 23:10. Jason slammed his fists onto the steering wheel in frustration. There was only ten minutes left. He slowly reversed the car out onto the quiet road and headed directly to his destination. He took out a small cloth from inside his suit. Dabbing his forehead, two Nissans cut off Jason's exit out and a Nissan stopped the Audi from leaving behind. Shit. Four Chinese men left each of the car's each with a gun. Jason gave an impassive look. \"You. Get out the car!\" A man shouted pointing a rifle towards Jason. The bullet proof glass had been taken down after he landed the bridge, so it required to bring it back up again. Jason remained in his seat and slowly got out a black gun from the glove compartment and put it slowly into his black suit. \"Get out now!\" Another Chinese man shouted. I don't have time for this bullshit Jason thought. He gradually gripped the handle and opened the door. \"And the suitcase,\" the man growled.

I don't own Atlantis: The Lost Empire . If I did, there'd be aliens. \"Knock knock.\" Vinny said, tossing a stick of dynamite up and down. \"Room service!\" Cookie yelled, aiming his shotgun at some random place in the air. The king's guards stiffened, their spears pointed at the intruders. \"Tell them to lower their weapons. NOW!\" Helga yelled as she shoved Kida forward, pointing Rourke's pistol-which she took from him when her soldiers had restrained him-at the princess' head. He looked to his left and saw Milo fighting tears as he clutched The Shepherd's Journal to his chest. The poor linguist hadn't signed on for this, for robbery and genocide. He'd thought he was truly on an exploration mission, only to have the entire crew turn on him, threaten him and use him. Well, almost the entire crew. The night before they reached Atlantis, after most everyone else had gone to sleep, Lyle had taken Milo a little ways from the camp, so no one else would hear what he had to say. He didn't want anyone else to know yet, but he'd finally become confident enough to tell Milo. After all, it took guts to tell someone you were in love with them. To his relief, Milo revealed that he'd felt the same way, but was too afraid to say so, fearing yet another rejection. When Rourke asked what he meant by that, he hadn't been prepared for the heartbreaking amount of rejections and standups Milo had been through that left the young man sobbing quietly in his arms. He couldn't understand it, how someone as kind and sweet as Milo hadn't been taken yet. But he was also glad, for it meant that Milo was his now. Which was why seeing him like this hurt. Lyle wanted so badly to pull him close and dry his tears. But all he could do was watch as Helga's goon, Clayton, roughly shoved Milo forward, sending him stumbling and almost dropping his glasses. Rourke didn't pay much attention to what was being said. He could guess what was happening. Helga asked the king where to find the crystal, he refused, and she punched him. Kida yelled something in Atlantean, trying in vain to break away and run to her father who lay on the floor now. Rourke had been in the same position just minutes earlier. He'd tried to get to Milo's side as Clayton yanked him out of the water by his hair, the linguist yelling in pain, only to be pulled back by two more soldiers who then bound his hands. Suddenly, Helga seemed to figure out the answer to her question as she went out to the middle of the pool, dragging Kida with her. Clayton followed as the platform began to sink, pulling Milo and Rourke onto it with him. Milo held out a shaking hand to brush against Rourke's as they descended. Rourke responded by giving it a soft squeeze, as if to say \"I'm here for you.\". With his hands tied, the act was hidden behind Lyle's back as he shot a glance at the scared, sad looking Milo. \"Finally!\" Helga said when they came to a stop. She took a few steps forward, staring up at the enormous blue crystal, as Kida dropped to her knees, speaking rapid Atlantean. Helga whirled around and jabbed the pistol at Milo. \"You, tell her to knock it off. Now!\" Reluctantly, Milo did as he was told. What else could he do? Helga then shoved him aside and started questioning Kida about getting the crystal down. Clayton huffed and kicked a stone into the water. Suddenly, the crystal turned red, beams of light circling the room as if searching for something. Clayton had joined Helga in interrogating Kida, seemingly forgetting about Milo and Rourke. \"Milo\" Rourke whispered, \"Can you untie-Milo?\" But something strange was happening. One of the beams had fallen on Milo. Suddenly, his eyes changed. Where his pupil and iris had been was now solid glowing blue, just like the Crystal. He slowly walked past Rourke and everyone else, his gaze never leaving the crystal, as if he were in a trance. As he passed them, the others finally noticed. \"Start talkin' princess.\" Clayton growled, \"What's goin' on?\" \"I do not know.\" Kida said. She was spared further questions when Milo turned around and spoke. But It didn't sound like Milo only. It sounded more like someone or something talking THROUGH him. He spoke Atlantean, yet somehow, Rourke knew what he said. \" All will be well, Lyle Rourke. Be not afraid. \" Then Milo turned back toward the crystal and started walking out toward it...on top of the water. Even Helga and Clayton could only watch in silence as Milo finally arrived at the center of the pool, the other beams of light converging on him, becoming a thin strand that expanded again with a flash over Milo's chest. Now his eyes were closed, as if he were asleep, his brown hair floating weightlessly around him. Despite the situation, Rourke couldn't deny that the sight was beautiful, even as Milo rose into the air, slowly turning around in the beam of light that lifted him high above their heads. \"Milo!\" He gasped as the scholar was taken into the crystal. The stones around it started to spin faster and faster, until there was a blinding flash of light. When it faded, all that was left was a sliver the same color as the crystal. As they watched, it changed and morphed, taking the shape of Milo without his glasses. He had become the crystal. Milo, what have we done to you? Was all Rourke could think about as Milo was slowly lowered down to the water and it seemed the water would not even touch him. For as he stood on the water a perfect circle that surrounded him. Rourke took a step forward somewhat horrified by what he was seeing and what they may have caused the scholar to become, but before he could take another step Helga and Claton grabbed his arms stopping him. \"Hold your horses, lover boy. Let's see what happens.\" Helga told him gazing at Milo with greed. Rourke glared at her, then looked back at Milo with sad eyes. \"Milo.\" He softly called seeing that the man had his eyes closed and his head down. At the call of his name, the crystal being lifted his head and opened his eyes showing a pure light blue glow. Gone were Milo's soft brown eyes, replaced by pure power. \"No!\" Rourke gasped, a tear forming in his eye, \"Milo!.\" He repeated unable to believe that the man he had fallen for, the man he loved, had become this living crystal. If it could even be called living, that is. There was no color to Milo except bright blue, almost as if he was just made of that flowing power which caused his hair to flow almost as if a wind was blowing it around. Rourke bit his lip hard to keep from crying as the crystallized Milo moved toward them, the stones that had been floating above them began to fall into the pool one by one showing that they were carved with faces. Milo finally walked onto the shore and began to walk toward the hidden platform. He went to stand in the center of the platform that had brought them down here. Once they had all joined him, the crystal being lifted his arms out to his sides and the platform rose up again. Kida freed Lyle's hands as they rose, but he was too heartbroken to care. A few minutes later, Rourke watched helplessly as Milo was shut into an airtight, watertight container. The glass in the portholes crystallized, obscuring Milo from view as armed soldiers pushed him back \"How can you people do this?\" Kida cried, \"He is one of your own! He trusted you! All of you! He-\" \"Save it.\" Rourke said, \"They don't care about him. They never did. They only pretended to so he would lead them on their damn treasure hunt. That's all they care about. Money. Riches. Wealth. And obviously, they're perfectly fine with killing people to get it.\" He saw some of them flinch at that, but he didn't care. The one thing he cared about was sealed in a metal prison on the back of a truck. \"You seem to care about him.\" she pointed out, \"Why do you and not them?\" Rourke sighed. There was no point in hiding it anymore. Just then, Vinny spoke up. \"We did care about him, Rourke, but-\" Vinny was cut off. \"No you didn't!\" the commander yelled, \"None of you did! None of you EVER did! You treated him like dirt the whole way here!\" \"And what did YOU do?\" Audrey demanded, \"Why do YOU care?\" Rourke recoiled at that. \"I...I LOVE him, dammit! And I'm losing him so you people can get rich! I didn't realize people's lives meant so little any more. I bet you'd all still do this if that was someone you loved in there!\" Audrey's eyes went wide. She obviously didn't expect that answer. \"Oh boo hoo, Lyle, you lost your little boy toy. No one cares.\" Helga said. \"HOW DARE YOU!' Lyle roared, \"I would NEVER treat Milo like that! Ever!\" \"Whatever. Here, you can have this. Let's go, people!\" Helga tossed something into his hands that he realized was Milo's bag, filled with his pencils, notebooks, and journals, as well as his beloved photograph of his grandfather. Lyle pulled it out, staring sadly at the tiny child Milo leaning on the old explorer's knee, his smile almost too big for his little face. Lyle was dimly aware of doors slamming, until a moment later, he was joined by Audrey, then Vinny, then Mole, Cookie, and Packard. Sweet was still back at the palace. Suddenly, Kida jerked the photo from Lyle's hands. \"It cannot be!\" she gasped. Before anyone could ask what she meant, she raced for the palace. Rourke turned around in time to see Helga driving across the bridge. \"We can't let her do this! Milo!\" Rourke yelled, running after her. \"Wait a second. It's bombed.\" Vinny warned. A second later, the bridge exploded. \"NOOOOOOOO!\" Lyle screamed. But he knew it was hopeless. Milo was gone. Forever. Reluctantly, he turned and went back to the palace where Sweet had called him, the others following him. He arrived to find Kida sitting beside her father, crying as Sweet told her he'd done all he could for the old man. \"I'm so sorry.\" Was all Rourke could say. \"You have lost someone, too, Rourke.\" Kida reminded him. As if he needed reminding \"Why him? What did Milo do wrong to deserve this.\" \"It is not anything he did.\" the old king rasped as Rourke came over and knelt by his side, \"It is who he is that got him chosen. This man-\" he held up Milo's photo and pointed to Thaddeus, \"-I know him. He is my younger brother, Prince Talos.\" \"That's Milo's grandfather.\" Rourke said. The king nodded. \"Talos left us sometime after the great flood. No one knew where he went or why he went there. Until now, we've found no trace of him since he left.\" \"But what does that have to do with the Crystal and Milo?\" Rourke asked. \"In its time of need, the Crystal will choose a host, one of royal blood, to protect itself and its people,\" the king explained, \"This host can be any member of the royal family, even if they do not hold a throne. Since your companion is a blood descendant of Talos, he is royal blood. Thus, the Crystal chose him.\" The old man's eyes closed. \"I hid the crystal to prevent this from happening, to keep anyone from ever meeting the fate of my wife.\" \"What fate?\" Rourke asked, worried now, \"What's going to happen to Milo?\" \"If he remains bonded to the crystal, as he is now, he could become lost to it...forever.\" Rourke gasped. So he really COULD lose Milo forever! \"No. Please, there's gotta be a way to save him. I'll do anything. I-\" He cut off as the old king took his hand. \"My daughter has told me of your love for the one called Milo. It is not unlike that which I have for my daughter. Thus, I can understand your pain. But there is only one way to save the ones we love now. Take my daughter with you. Return the Crystal...Save Atlantis...\" the old man coughed, \"...Save your dear Milo...\" His hand suddenly went limp and fell from Rourke's. But there was still a warmth in his hand. Rourke opened his hand to see that the old man had given him his crystal. The old man who now lay as if he were asleep, with his eyes closed. Kida cried softly at her father's side, and Lyle could tell they'd been close. He silently backed away to give her a moment with him. He looked down at the crystal in his hand and Milo's photograph. It killed him that the king's last image of his great nephew had been seeing him crystallized and taken away. And poor Milo hadn't even known he was related to the man. Well, at least he still had one living family member left in Kida. But his relief at this didn't last, as he remembered that he was trapped here, in the doomed city. He couldn't save Milo. \"I know I'm a physician, not a psychologist,\" Sweet said, \"but if I remember correctly, I think Thaddeus Thatch once told you that when you hit rock bottom, the only place left to go is up.\" \"Great, Doc, but none of us can fly.\" Rourke said bitterly. Kida's head shot up at the word \"fly\" \"Rourke...I may have a way after all.\" All eyes fell on her as she took Rourke's hand. \"Come, I will show you.\" He let her leadhim out of the palace to where a large stone fish sat. Without missing a step, the princess leapt onto the fish and sat on it like a horse. \"It is a vehicle.\" she explained, \"Milo showed me.\" She inserted her crystal, put her hand on the pad, and turned the crystal, just as Milo had instructed. A small crowd had gather and now they gasped in awe as the stone fish suddenly came to life and slowly rose off the ground. Rourke couldn't believe his luck. Of all the vehicles, the fish turned out to be a flying machine! Exactly what he needed! \"Kida, you're a lifesaver!\" Lyle cried. He then turned to the crew and small crowd of Atlanteans. \"I'm not going to ask anyone to do this with me, as it may very well be a suicide mission. But I'm going after her. Yes, Audrey, I'm aware it's a crazy thing to do. But it's also the right thing to do. It's...\" a tear shone in his eye, \"...it's what Milo would want.\" No one argued with him. No one said a word, until an Atlantean standing beside the stone fish called out \"How is this done?\" Rourke let Kida spout off the instructions as he jumped into a long narrow vehicle that looked like a hammerhead shark. Using the king's crystal, he started the vehicle, its low hum filling the air, joining the others as more of the vehicles rose into the air with it. \"We will return the Heart. We will save Atlantis! Or we will die trying!\" Kida called out, the cries of the Atlantean warriors answering her. But what she said next, what earned the loudest response, took Rourke by complete surprise. \"FOR MILO!\" the princess screamed, the warriors repeating her cry despite not knowing who Milo was. His heart went out to these people, who rallied behind the name of his love, and who were willing to fly into a fight they may not return from, to save a person they didn't know. His heart warmed at this as he came alongside Kida and the two shot forward with the rest behind them. Rourke could only hope they weren't too late. Rourke was a master strategist, but Kida knew her people's skills better than he did. So instead, he focused on his own crew. The minute they saw the Gyro-evac rising into the air, the crystal hanging from a set of black chains below it, Rourke ordered Audrey and Sweet to try and free the crystal, while he and Vinny would be decoys, to draw attention away from them. Mole was sent to cover them. Then Rourke saw her. Helga. The traitor. The one who stole his Milo away. The one who would kill an entire race of innocent people. For money. The fact made him sick, and as Helga shouted some inaudible order to her soldiers, Rourke surged forward into the fray, dodging the very anti-aircraft weapons he'd been trained to use. The stone shark actually handled better than any other vehicle he'd ever driven, responding to even his slightest action as he flew toward the huge balloon in a curving, serpentine way. He spotted Milo's container and saw Audrey on top of it sawing at the chains as she yelled something at Sweet and he responded. He heard buzzing engines and saw small, single pilot portable airplanes launching from one of the trucks, some headed right for him. \"That's right,\" Rourke snarled, \"come and get me.\" He steered them away from the balloon. Having been trained to fly one in preparation for this trip, he knew his stone shark was faster and more maneuverable, more agile. That, and the dimwits flying the planes kept almost hitting each other, then hurling swears at each other for doing so. Clayton dropped one of the balloon's weights onto Sweet and Audrey's vehicle. Fortunately, Mole was there to pull them out. Helga was firing wildly with her big gun, that is, until an energy bolt from Vinny's fish sent it spinning to the ground. But the dratted balloon was still rising. Rourke knew there was only one way to fix that in time. He whipped around and shot like an arrow toward one of the secondary balloons. At the last moment, he jumped out, grabbing a cable on the main balloon and watching as his shark slammed into the secondary balloon, exploding it, and finally, the balloon began to reverse direction. \"We're losing altitude. Lighten the load!\" Clayton yelled as he and Helga started throwing things overboard. \"That's it.\" Clayton announced, \"unless someone wants to jump.\" \"After you.\" Helga smirked, shoving a surprised Clayton over the side of the gondola. He managed to grab the bottom of it and was now hanging from it by his hands. \"You said we were in this together!\" Clayton roared, \"You promised me a percentage!\" \"Next time, get it in writing.\" Helga sneered as she stamped hard on the man's fingers, causing him to let go and fall, screaming, to the ground below. \"Nothing personal!\" Helga yelled. This whole scene had angered Rourke even more, with the way she backstabbed her most loyal partner as well her lack of remorse for likely killing him. Helga barely had time to turn around before, out of nowhere, Kida leapt onto the platform, engaging her in a hand to hand fight. Helga had good training, but she didn't have the warrior princess' experience or strength. \"You will NOT be allowed to destroy my people, vile witch!\" Kida yelled. At least Rourke hoped she'd said \"witch\". It was difficult to hear when he was being shot at by machine guns. Unbeknownst to any of them, Clayton had survived his fall. He'd sustained serious injuries, maybe even life threatening ones, but he still had a bit of strength left in him. It was painful to move, but his anger at Helga's backstabbing quickly overshadowed that. He groaned as he pulled out a flare gun and aimed at the main balloon. \"Nothing...personal.\" he snarled as he pulled the trigger. A flare shot from the barrel, blazing toward the huge balloon leaving a pillar of smoke in its wake. Clayton strained his eyes to follow it. Only when he saw the impact, and the balloon burst into flames, did he let his arms and the gun fall, a smile on his face. Kida had just started to gain the upper hand when something slammed into the craft and it erupted in a blazing inferno. Kida barely managed to jump back onto her vehicle in time, the ends of her skirt and hair singed by the blaze. Helga was now beyond furious. She was INSANE. She finally pulled out Rourke's pistol and started firing like mad at any target she could find. The flames were rising up the canvas toward Rourke, leaving him no choice. He took his cable in both hands and swung down toward the gondola. Helga turned and saw him at the last second before he collided with her, his weight and momentum carrying them both over the side railing, where they caught another cable that dropped them onto the secondary gondola, just above the huge rotor blades that spun beneath the craft, trying to push it up. A pierce of the upper railing, which had broken apart when they fell through it, lodged itself in the blades, stopping them from spinning. While Helga was still somewhat disoriented by their fall, Rourke seized the chance to haul himself over the railing and climb down through the blades to the chain rig holding the crystal. Holding Milo. Ordinarily, he would've done more actual fighting than he had this whole time. But that wasn't what he was here for. His main objective, above all else, was to get the crystal back as soon as possible. The king's warning about Milo being lost to the crystal echoed in his mind as he tried to find a way to detach the crystal from the balloon. Hold on, Thatch, he pleaded silently, Just a little longer. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Helga growled, climbing down after him, a fire axe in her hand. She swung crazily at him, even breaking one of the glass portholes on Milo's container. Immediately, Rourke's instincts had him duck under her swing, while also grabbing a large shard of the glass, which he noticed was crystallized like Milo. \"Nothing personal, Lyle.\" she grinned as she wound up to take the swing that would rend him in two. And that's when Rourke struck. As she turned her back to him in the wind-up, he gave an almost feral cry as he drove the shard into the traitor's back, tearing a scream of pain from her. Rourke couldn't ignore the irony of his attack. Helga, who had backstabbed even her most loyal man, had literally been stabbed in the back herself. But instead of collapsing with blood rushing out, Helga was changing. She became a crystal version of herself, dark blue with cracks of red all over. Empty pits were her eyes, a fiery hole was her mouth. Before she was done changing, Rourke was on his way back up the rig, the monster following him. The piece of railing that had jammed the blades was finally broken and they spun freely again, trapping Rourke where he was. The crystalline nightmare that had been Helga finally caught up to him, climbing up onto the support ring and slowly inching toward him. the rig shifting slightly whenever it moved. This gave Rourke an idea for one last possible defense. He wasn't even sure it would work, but if it didn't, he was a goner either way. He waited until Helga was all the way up onto the ring before he launched himself backward off of it, holding on with only his hands. As he had hoped, his weight and speed jerked his side of the ring down and sent the other side-and Helga with it-shooting straight up into the rotors. Rourke looked away as he heard her awful screech as she was shattered. The flying crystal shards were enough to sever the chains that held the box up. Rourke dropped onto it and landed beside it in a pile of soft ash, having only a second to move it before the fiery skeleton of the balloon came crashing down. The next few moments were a blur for Rourke, as they attached the crystal to the stone fish to fly it out, only to have the hook break. He remembered jumping back down and securing the chain around the box, riding out on it. You're safe, Milo. he thought as they raced back to Atlantis. Without waiting for the box to even touch down, Rourke was already prying it open with an Atlantean's spear. Suddenly, a blinding light shone from within, and as Rourke backed away, the box broke apart on its own, its parts spinning around the crystal Milo, who now stood in the center of the landing area. The pieces of the box flew away, splashing harmlessly into the water. All around them, the carved lines and symbols started to glow with the Crystal's light. When the entire city has been lit, Milo raised his arms out to his sides. The ground shook as the huge carved stone faces, now glowing like the rest of the city, broke through the ground and rose into the air, along with Milo. The stones then spun around him, getting faster until they were a single, blurry ring around Milo. Beams of light shot from Milo out to the edges of the city, and wherever a beam struck, an enormous statue rose out of the water and walked out to the cliff's edge. They stood in a circle around Atlantis. Then they clapped their massive hands together, and when their hands parted, a glittering shield spread outward as the statues opened their arms out to their sides. Rourke couldn't help but be amazed as the glittering shields merged with each other and expanded upward, until they finally converged above Milo, sealing Atlantis inside a glittering dome. And not a second too soon, for a tidal wave of lave rushed over top of the dome, covering it completely. Something about the dome instantly cooled the lava into rock. For a moment, nothing happened. The, glowing cracks appeared in the rock, spreading from the top of the dome downward, the rock finally flaking off and falling in huge chunks which raised enormous dust clouds with their thunderous crashing down. And then it was over. All was silent as the dust rose above the city. Rourke looked around, not believing what had just happened. A few gasps turned his attention back to the area where the crystal had risen from. A single beam cut through the dust clouds. Rourke stared up at it, his heart all but leaping out of his chest at what he saw. Milo. Restored to his former self, his brown hair floating around him as he descended, his eyes closed behind his glasses as if he were sleeping. As he neared the ground, Rourke stepped into the beam of light, arms out to receive him. For a moment, the scholar hovered there. Then the light faded and Milo dropped into Rourke's waiting arms with a heavy sigh. Rourke wasted no time hugging him close. It didn't matter who saw right now, all that mattered was that Milo was safe and in his arms. Tears stung the commander's eyes as he held the small man close, his fingers dug into soft brown hair. \"mmmmm...Lyle?\" Milo said softly, tiredly. \"Yes.\" Rourke answered smiling through tears, \"Yes, Milo, I'm here. Everything's okay now. You're okay now.\" He hugged Milo again. \"I thought I lost you, Thatch.\" That was an understatement. Rourke had been in pain from the moment Milo was chosen, pain caused by the idea that he would never see the young scholar with his nose in a book again, never hear his voice rattling on about some dead language, and never get the chance to hold him close again, to feel Milo's hair brush against his chin, so softly he almost didn't notice it. He'd thought he'd never look down into those warm brown eyes so full of wonder and innocence again. But here he was. Milo was back with him, head now resting on Lyle's shoulder. Milo then lifted up one hand that Rourke just noticed had been closed. Slowly he opened it and his eyes went wide. In Milo's hand lay a crystal pendant, but it looked much older than the ones on the other Atlanteans. Also attached to it was a small metal compass. It looked like it had seen better days, but Milo's eyes filled with tears when he saw it. Rourke was about to ask him what it was, Milo answered him with a soft whisper. \"Grandpa.\" And then it clicked. Of course. The compass and the crystal had both belonged to Milo's grandfather, who had raised him and loved him up until he died. Rourke gently took it and slipped it around Milo's neck. \"It's okay, Milo,\" he said, \"They all know about us now. You don't have to hold it inside anymore.\" He placed a soft kiss on Milo's forehead. Milo looked down at the compass, whose needle still spun to point North. At the moment, it also pointed to Rourke. Without warning, Milo leapt up into Rourke's embrace, throwing his arms around the huge man's neck. Rourke gladly accepted, lovingly stroking Milo's hair out of his face and gently drying his tears. \"I love you, Milo. I love you so much and I never want to lose you again.\" Milo smiled at this. \"I love you, too, Lyle.\" Milo said, showing that smile of his Rourke loved. He couldn't help it anymore. Right there in front of the crew and at least half of Atlantis, Rourke full on kissed the scholar on the mouth. And Milo kissed him right back. It was like every love story they had ever heard, the two lovers sealing their bond with their first kiss at the end. Except this was real. This was actually happening. Though he hadn't come looking for it, Rourke had discovered the greatest treasure he could ever imagine on this trip. And it was all his. As for Milo, he finally felt like he'd found his place in the world. In Atlantis, the place he'd always dreamed of finding, he'd found the person he never thought existed. A person who loved him so much that they would face all the terrors of hell and even Death itself, just for him. He'd never thought such a person could be real. Until he'd found Lyle Rourke. He would later hear from the crew just how much his being taken had hurt Lyle, how much the commander had worried about him. Rourke too had once thought he would die alone. But then he came here and met the selfless, brave linguist who had still stood by what was right, even with guns trained on him, his life hinging on whether or not their fingers moved. It was such actions that made him admire Milo, and showed that Milo's true strength was far greater than any of their own. His strength was in his heart, so overflowing with love now. He knew Kida was talking to the others and loading a vehicle full of treasure for them. Of course Rourke had decided to stay in Atlantis, knowing how happy that would make Milo. After their last picture, the commander waved farewell to the giant fish vehicle. They could have all the gold and silver and jewels. Rourke would have traded it all anyway to be with Milo. Neither of them had any money, or influence, or power, but neither cared. As long as they had each other, they were the richest, most important men in the world. Hope you liked it, Saphira!

This takes place after Safe and Sound but is a standalone fic. Thought of this while listening to \"Lothlorien\" by Enya. Lyle knew the sound before he was even fully awake. Milo, waking up screaming from another nightmare. Sure enough, when he turned over, the linguist was sitting bolt upright, shaking and clutching the covers. His face was ghostly pale, his brown eyes wide with fear, and his face wet with tears. His lower lip quivered as he stared out over the sleeping city of Atlantis outside their window. Thankfully, their room was in the royal palace, which meant it was unlikely Milo had wakened anyone else in the huge building. Only Lyle, who didn't mind. Who understood what was wrong. \"Milo?\" he said softly, so as not to startle the young man. \"L-Lyle...I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to wake you.\" Rourke sat up beside Milo and brushed his hair aside. \"It's okay, Milo. That's what I'm here for.\" He dried a few tears from the scholar's eyes before they had a chance to fall, \"Was it the flashback again?\" Milo nodded and Rourke pulled him close, letting his chin rest in Milo's hair and rubbing his back soothingly. \"I know it's over and all, but it still seems so real. Especially...\" He cut off, wondering if he should share the change in the dream with Lyle or not. But then, if he couldn't tell Lyle, who COULD he tell? \"What?\" Rourke asked, concerned. \"Well...it was reversed. You were injured in the volcano battle. You fell off the balloon...You were the one dying, not me. A-And...\" His tears started to form again and he unconsciously clung to Rourke. \"...th-the crystal...d-d-didn't s-save you!\" He shook harder and Rourke hugged him close. \"I'm right here, Milo, and I promise, I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here, and no one is going to hurt you in any way. I promise.\" \"I know. God, why am I so...worked up by this?\" This was normal, too. Milo still beat himself up whenever he showed anything remotely akin to weakness. Perhaps it was a result of his tragic past and hard, lonely childhood, where he was always the target for bullies because of his small size, intelligence, and glasses. Hearing such things so much had made Milo start to believe them. \"Why can't I be more like you, Lyle?\" \"Because then you wouldn't be Milo, the man I fell in love with on the trip to Atlantis. You'd just be some dumb grunt toting a gun and spewing orders.\" This achieved its goal, as Milo gave a tiny smile and shook his head against the broad chest. \"You're not dumb, Lyle, you just have a different kind of knowledge.\" Rourke couldn't help but grin at the sweet, innocent way he said it. Sometimes, he'd say things on purpose, just to get Milo to talk that way. It was one thing he loved about the scholar, along with the starry-eyed look of wonder that had become natural for Milo. This man was so different from all the military and mercenary types he'd encountered before. He never felt any connection to them. But the minute he'd seen Milo, he'd felt a sudden need to protect the young linguist. He remembered dragging the frightened and disoriented Milo through the submarine to the EVAC shuttle when the Leviathan attacked, how truly scared to death he'd been, hugging The Shepherd's Journal for dear life and screaming in terror as the beast chased them. Of course, Milo had been through much worse since then, thanks to Helga's betrayal. Rourke still shuddered at the image of the broken and bloody Milo dying in his arms on the floor of the volcano, and the memory of the panic that overtook him when he learned nothing could be done in time to save Milo, just before the Crystal had taken Milo up to it and healed him before placing him back in Lyle's arms. Much like he was now. \"Well, no matter, I don't want you to be like me, Milo. I love you the way you are, and I wouldn't change it for the world.\" Milo reached up and hugged his neck, their crystals knocking against each other. \"I wouldn't change you either, Lyle. You always make me feel safe and loved.\" \"Because you are, Milo. You are the most wonderful person I've ever had the privilege of knowing, let alone loving.\" \"Even though I wake you up like this every night?\" Rourke laughed and ran his fingers through Milo's soft hair. \"Yes, even then. Besides, you love me even though you say I snore like a sawmill.\" Now Milo laughed. \"You do, but not as bad as Cookie did. Anyway, I don't mind it. It helps me sleep some nights.\" Rourke smiled and lay back down, Milo on top of him, the linguist's head against his heart. With a contented sigh, Rourke pulled the covers back over the two of them and laid there just holding his love, watching those warm brown eyes slowly close as Rourke continued to rub his back soothingly. This was still so strange to him, being soft, gentle, affectionate with someone else. But it came easily to him when it involved Milo, who naturally wouldn't hurt a fly, though his sometimes clumsiness got him injured a few times. He found he rather liked this side of himself, mainly because it helped him become closer to Milo, but also because he knew it was necessary. Being his old, strict, military self would only hurt Milo, and that was the last thing he wanted to do. His thoughts wandered to the war that had been about to start on the surface when they left, and how Milo had said he couldn't go back for fear of being drafted. Lyle had almost said he would go and protect him, but stopped because he knew that wasn't how the military worked. Besides, Milo was so happy here in Atlantis, the place he'd dreamed of finding his whole life. The only thing that made it better, according to the scholar, was having someone to love and share it with. As Milo slept peacefully against him, Rourke looked up at the ceiling and thanked whatever higher powers or Fates existed for giving him the wonderful gift of this paradise to call home, and giving him an amazing man to share it with. Then he hugged his Milo close and fell asleep again, a blissful smile on his face. ","Summary":" I don't own Atlantis. This takes place after Safe and Sound but is a standalone fic.

I'm trying to work on my other stories but sometimes I need to work on another one until I can get ideas following for my other fanfics. And as usual this will switch P.O.V.s( point of view) throughout the chapter. Please let me know what you think it will mean a lot to me and when my friend Firedust934 post a fanfic please be nice to her she is a new author and will do her best. I know I'm not perfect with my writing and it does mean a lot when I get help from my fellow writers, readers and others that take the time to leave me a review or pm on ways I can improve my own writing. And finally on to the story. Helga P.O.V. The first thing I registered was intense pain throughout my whole body, as I tried to roll over to reach my flare gun that I had tucked behind my back. With every breath I took my chest erupted in pain. I was finally able to reach my flare gun and proceeded to painfully roll over grunting as I did so. I lined up my shot and pulled the trigger saying the same words he told me \"nothing personal\". I managed a small smile as I hit my target then I gave into the blackness that was calling my name. That is the last thing I remember. Mere hours later still Helga P.O.V. Muffled voices are the first thing I heard when I briefly came to. \"Where did you find her again?\" \"In a cave that the lava missed, the explosion must have thrown her there.\" \"It's a miracle she's still alive. With that many shattered and broken bones she should be dead.\" \"What are we to do with her my queen?\" \"When she is done healing, yes? \"Yes.\" \"Give her a second chance.\" \"But she is one of the ones that tried to kill you?!\" \"Yes, I know that but she saved me as well even if it nearly cost her her life in the process.\" They were silent after that and I gave into the darkness again, hoping it would claim me. I didn't deserve a second chance. Not after everything I've done, why couldn't they see that? Kida P.O.V. I hope I know what I'm doing. I could basically feel the regret radiating off of the blonde. She does feel sorry for what happened and she had done and almost done. I meet Milo outside of the healers room in the palace. He hadn't been allowed to enter. \"Kida, who did they find? And what happened to him?\" Milo almost immediately questioned. \"It wasn't a him but a her? My healer said they witnessed her being thrown from a great height. And when they went on patrol after the crystal protected our city from the lava they found her in a small cave untouched by the lava.\" I replied to him as we began walking away from the room. \"Kida by chance does this women have blonde hair down to the middle of her back?\" Milo questioned. \"Yes she does, why? \" \"It's Helga Sinclair. What are you going to do with her?\" \"Once she has healed fully, give her a second chance and before you say anything yes I know she tried to kill me.\" I explained seeing his face scrunching up in anger. \"And what if she betrays us? She's already done it before what's to stop her from doing it again?\" Mio pestered me as we continued to walk to the throne room. \"Nothing but herself. I believe she can change, you should show the same respect as well.\" I tried explaining and again why couldn't anyone understand. \"If she hurts you in any way, she gets banished.\" Milo stated as we came to a stop outside the throne room. \"Deal.\" I agree recently and from there we parted ways. Weeks late Helga's P.O.V. I woke up to a damp cloth being pressed against my face. It was cold and I tried pulling away from the coldness but the movement caused me intense pain. I slowly blinked my eyes open at least that didn't cause any pain. \"Kida she's awake.\" a male voice spoke in a hushed tone. \"All right Milo, I'll be over in a second.\" a female voice that I believe was Kida answered My mind was groggy and I couldn't think clearly. I felt like I knew them but I couldn't be sure, at least for the time being. \"What happened?\" I asked my voice cracking from not being used for what I would guess is weeks if not at least a month. \"You nearly died.\" Kida answered as she came to stand behind Milo. 'So that's what happened' I thought. It hurt like hell to breath and when I tried to sit up I was stopped by Kida. \"You need to stay as still as possible or your ribs won't properly heal.\" Kida explained as she pushed me back onto the soft bed. That's what I assumed was wrong when I was fighting to air into my lungs. \"Where am I?\" I asked my voice sounding more hoarse now and not cracking with every word. \"In the healers room in the palace. We brought you here because it would be the safest place for you to be.' Kida answered as she took a seat on the beds edge. \"How long will I be here?\" I questioned quietly. \"For another few weeks until your ribs and right leg fully heal.\" Milo answered me this time. 'Great another two to three weeks of doing nothing but laying in a bed' I thought to myself, \"This was going to be fun.\" I couldn't do anything and I didn't like that at all. \"And what will happen to me once I'm fully healed?\" I asked tentatively. \"You will be given a second chance.\" Kida answered before walking over to tend to a small fire I had just now noticed. \"But I don't deserve one. I tried to kill your whole culture.\" I reasoned hoping to prove a point. \"We know, but we also know how you saved us all once you realized your mistake.\" Kida replied as she placed a bowl in my lap. \"I know that but I still shouldn't get a second chance.\" I mumbled quietly. \"Helga, just eat your food before it gets cold.\" Milo sighed. I considered not eating the food at all saying I wasn't hungry when my stomach decided to let out a nose of discontentment. I needed to eat even if I didn't want to. Without trying to move too much I reached for the bowl and spoon. I brought lifted the bowl with one hand and the spoon in the other. The soup didn't smell the best but I refused to let that show on my face. Out of the corner of my eye I spotted Milo giving off a small smile. Once I had finished to my amusement and displeasure Milo took the now empty bowl and from my hands and gave it to Kida who then then left the room. Milo stayed behind and right by my side which was beginning to annoy me deeply. But I couldn't blame him, not after what I had done. \"If you want to say something just say it already.\" I told him carefully as I watched for his reaction while keeping my rising temper in check. \"Why?\" was all he said. I remained silent taking my time to compose an answer before answering, \" I realized I made a mistake and I couldn't blindly follow orders that had such deadly consequences. I didn't want to follow his orders anymore but I had to. He threatened to kill me but that almost happened anyway.\" The whole time I talked I watched Milo trying to gage what his reaction would be. For all he knew I could be lying but I wasn't. He sat in silence while I spoke and what he answered surprised me. \"This is exactly what Kida means. You do feel sorry for what happened and you should be given a second chance!\" Milo exploded a huge grin becoming plastered on his face as he spoke. \"Milo, I shouldn't be alive, that fall should have killed me instantly.\" I argue back before whispering to myself, \" I wish I was dead.\" Milo stopped what he was saying mid sentence and sighed a frown etched onto his face now. I hope he didn't hear the last thing that came out of my mouth. \"Helga, did you ever think you were given a second chance for a reason?\" Milo re-corrupted sounding defeated. \"No.\" was my simple answer. I had grown up in a very strict environment and I could make very little to no mistakes. If I made too many I was punished. But no one knew that expect for myself and Rourke. Damn that asshole. He trained me for most of my life and was the one to dish out my punishments if I did something wrong in training. \"I'll be back, don't go anywhere.\" Milo told me as he left the room and probably forgetting I couldn't really walk. Great now no one wants to be in the same room as me. I decide I might as well try and get some more sleep.

The King looked at the same view as her but she's certain that what they're seeing are two different things. She saw gentle rolling hills and the embrace of a giving ocean but the King… he saw sculptures, men and women, in the hills and riches beyond the horizon. The Queen knows this is why she loves him. When the stones gave way to flying fish and the waters receded beneath their feet, the King nodded and she bowed before the Crystal and sworn that blood will always yield honor and duty. Their hands touched as they planted the stones in the throne room's pond. The Queen knows this is love as their child held her fingers and didn't let go. She didn't say anything when the King revealed his plan. The Crystal could be used for power. Could be used as a weapon. For protection, of course. He whispered it in bed and they, along with his hands trailing along her back, caressed her in a warm embrace. This is love as fairy tales say it is so she does nothing but hold their child tight and tries not to let go. But love will always win, always endure. Love is something she has succumbed to since the moment she breathed air for the first time and a crystal was laid upon her forehead for blessings she didn't understand until this moment. The gentle rolling hills she had first seen when the King opened her eyes to the wonders of the land are crumbling beneath the anger of the waves. The giving ocean is no longer giving as it recedes, recedes, and comes back stronger and higher until the sun is no more. The Crystal calls. She hears nothing, sees nothing, feels nothing because she is love incarnate and she will go to the Crystal because she knows the Crystal is protection, is power, is glory, is honor, is all the things she had vowed back in the cool cave beneath the waters. The Crystal calls. Love calls. And she answers, gets pulled up, feels air beneath her feet, and turns into a crystalline light. - Probably no one will ever read this but just wanted to put this up here for my own satisfaction. - Hit me up if you don't understand it.

Hope you enjoy! I still don't own Atlantis, but I still love it even though Disney's buying Fox and now I don't know the fate of my favorite new show The Orville . Anyway, on to...whatever this is. Lyle Rourke almost missed the last member of the team, until Mr. Whitmore called him over and the smallest young man Rourke had ever seen eagerly greeted him. He figured this must be Whitmore playing a practical joke, as he sometimes did. He had to be. No way could this tiny, frail, toothpick of a person be the one who would lead them to Atlantis. \"Milo! I want you to meet Commander Rourke. He led the expedition that recovered the journal from Iceland.\" Or maybe he could. Yes, there was the Shepherd's Journal in his hands. \"Milo Thatch. Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus.\" Thaddeus Thatch hadn't been one of Rourke's favorite people, being an academic, but Rourke had still respected him and found him to be resourceful in a crisis. Unlike most academics, Thaddeus wasn't a know-it-all shoving his knowledge down others' throats. The young man before him looked exactly like the many photos Thaddeus had always carried with him of his grandson. The boy was without a doubt Thaddeus' favorite subject, and he had endless stories to tell about him. Lyle remembered one Thaddeus had told where the little boy had found what he thought was an arrowhead in a creek. The child had been so excited and overjoyed that Thaddeus didn't have the heart to tell him it wasn't an arrowhead after all. From the photos, one could track the boy's growth, from tiny baby, to puny toddler, to runty child, to scrawny teenager, and finally to the stick figure before him. The two must've been very close, for even Rourke could see the sadness that ghosted over Milo's face when his grandfather was mentioned. Great, thought Rourke, he's an emotional one. Just what we don't need on this trip. Still, his instincts told him to protect the young linguist, and Rourke had learned long ago to ALWAYS trust his instincts. \"Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.\" Helga said. Rourke nodded and started to issue an order when something slammed into the sub, sending everything into chaos. Alarms blared, people shouted, and Rourke spat out the orders he was trained to issue, even as they were relentlessly attacked and he saw Milo fall backward over the railing. The linguist lay stunned for only a second before realizing the glass of the sub was the only thing between him and the blood red eye of the Leviathan, which shrank as it focused in on him like the aperture of a camera. \"...it's a MACHINE!\" he heard Milo yell. The sub rocked again, and Milo was thrown back up onto the deck. Rourke grabbed him by his collar before he could smack into the wall and possibly end up dead. At that time, the order to abandon ship sounded. \"Let's go, people, MOVE!\" Helga yelled. \"Move? Move where-AH!\" Milo stumbled amid the other crewmembers, confused and panicked, his eyes wide, as people mercilessly ran into him, buffeting him back and forth. \"Come on.\" Rourke said, finally grabbing the scholar's hand and practically dragging him along the corridors and pushing him down into the EVAC shuttle. \"Everybody grab a seat and buckle in!\" Helga ordered. Rourke saw Milo fussing with the restraints and finally getting the harness fastened over his tiny body, stuffed between Sweet and Audrey, clutching the Shepherd's Journal against his chest. His eyes were still wide with fear, and Rourke could see him shaking as Helga fought with the EVAC's controls to get it free from the main sub, which was taking a brutal beating. Though no one said it, they all knew no one left on board that sub would survive much longer. A few seconds later, an energy burst from the Leviathan exploded the sub and probably vaporized anyone still on it. He managed to get Milo to identify where they would go, before a burst from the Leviathan rocked the craft and sent the linguist into hysterics, screaming with every bump and hit the craft took. He was shaking violently now, hugging the book against him like he thought it would save his life. Even when they finally surfaced in calm water, Milo still shook hard, even when the others exited the craft. Lyle had seen this look before, on new recruits in the military, getting their first up close look at the horrors of battle. Because of this, he took pity on Milo, unbuckling him once everyone else had left the craft. \"Come on, Thatch, you've got a job to do. Show us the way to Atlantis.\" Milo simply nodded and left the vessel, but Rourke could tell this disaster would plague him for a while longer. Everything was finally ready to begin the long underground journey. All the trucks were started up and in line...and an annoying horn sound caught Rourke's ear. He turned toward it and had to fight hard to keep his straight face. It was Milo, playing with the horn on his truck as avidly as a child played with a new toy, a happy little smile on his face, his eyes sparkling with delight. It was such an unexpected sight that the only way Rourke managed to keep his resolve was to break the horn off. And even then it was hard, because the look Milo gave him was so sweet and innocent that Rourke had to resort to talking in a condescending manner to the young man to cover up how badly he wanted to smile at this. Oh damn, I'm calling him \"cute\" now. Rourke thought. Milo was going to be the death of him, he was certain of that. Everyone knew Cookie's food was basically inedible. Everyone except Milo. Rourke noticed that everyone pretty much ignored the linguist throughout the trip, shutting him out of the group. Rourke actually felt sorry for him. He knew what that was like. As he watched, Milo suddenly stood up and ran for the edge of camp, a hand over his mouth. Alarmed, Rourke got up and followed him. Milo wasn't hard to find. All Rourke had to do was follow the horrible retching sounds he was making, and he found the young man on his hands and knees, puking into a hole most likely dug by the geologist. Milo's small form was almost convulsing with every heave he took. Rourke peered into the hole and was alarmed at the amount of vomit that came from the tiny man, who stood panting and gasping on all fours. \"No one told you not to eat that, did they.\" Milo shook his head. \"No,\" he squeaked, \"but I won't eat it again.\" Rourke nodded and held out the sandwich that was going to be his dinner. Hr figured Milo needed it more now, since the linguist hadn't known to bring his own supply of food to eat instead of Cookie's...whatever it was. Milo gratefully took the sandwich and ate it slowly under Rourke's watchful eye. The commander wanted to be sure the scholar wasn't actually ill and in need of medical care. \"Thank you.\" Milo said when he was done, and Rourke felt something warm in his chest. He stood up before the feeling made its way to his face. \"Don't eat that stuff anymore.\" Was all Rourke said as he walked away, thankful to the darkness for concealing his smile. Rourke could only stare in disbelief at the city of Atlantis before them, even as they drove across the bridge, with Milo chattering a mile a minute. \"Someone's enjoying themselves.\" Helga remarked, rolling her eyes at the oblivious Milo. Rourke only nodded and kept his gaze straight ahead. He'd distanced himself from the woman the closer they got to Atlantis. The same feeling that told him to protect Milo also told him not to get close to her, and it had never failed him before. \"Commander,\" she said, quieter, \"there were not supposed to be people down here. This changes everything.\" A chill ran through him at the lust in her voice. Lust, Rourke had learned long ago, was never a good thing to hear in someone's voice, for it usually led to deception, betrayal, and people dying. None of which would be good for this trip. Especially for Milo. As Rourke had grown more wary of Helga as they neared Atlantis, he'd also grown more protective of Milo, his heart nearly stopping when he called Milo's name after the bridge fell and the scholar didn't answer. Inside, he'd feared Milo lay crushed to death under the trucks and rubble. Only when the digger broke through the rock and he saw Milo staring at the city did he relax. He learned Milo had been knocked unconscious from the fall and thus hadn't heard his name being called. The young linguist had quieted and was now hanging out the side of the truck, staring in awe, his eyes sparkling in wonder at the city he had dreamed so long of finding. The place his grandfather had told him so many stories of. Rourke allowed the left corner of his mouth to curve up into a smile at the innocence and joy in Milo's face. Rourke's smile faded when he thought of what the news of their discovery would do. More people from the surface would come to Atlantis, plunder its resources and wealth, and leave only destruction in their wake. If Milo got to return to the city, he'd be heartbroken. On their journey, it had become clear that unlike everyone else on this trip, Milo wasn't interested in the money they would receive for this job, nor did he care what sources of wealth he might find in Atlantis. Someone (Helga was the first person that came to his mind) could easily manipulate the naive scholar into pointing the way to such treasure. He hated the thought of that happening to Milo and decided that as long as he was in command of the team Milo was part of, it was his job to make sure that didn't happen, no matter what. \"This changes nothing.\" Rourke growled. Especially not my thoughts about you. He was determined to keep her away from Milo at all costs. After the audience with the king, who had agreed to let them stay in Atlantis for one night at Helga's persuasion (which both Rourke and Milo found uncomfortable), Rourke pulled the linguist aside, ducking into a small, dark alley behind a building. \"What is it, Com-\" \"Shhh!\" Rourke hissed, peering out to make sure no one was around, \"Keep your voice down, Thatch. I pulled you here because I need to warn you about something. Someone, actually.\" \"Who?\" Milo asked, quietly now. \"Helga.\" Rourke said, \"Don't trust her, and don't be alone with her.\" \"What? Why?\" Milo said, confused. \"I just have this...really bad feeling about her. I was always taught to trust my instincts, and they're telling me she's bad news. And they have yet to be wrong.\" \"But she's-\" \"One of us? I thought so at first, but now I'm not so sure, and I'm trained in this stuff.\" Milo nodded \"So what do I do?\" \"Just don't trust her.\" Rourke said, \"Stay alert and watch your back with her. Can you do that, son?\" \"Yes sir.\" Milo agreed, \"Consider it done.\" Just to be on the safe side, Rourke made sure to keep Milo in his sights, following stealthily as Milo went with the princess on a tour of the city. Since he was alone, he didn't worry about hiding his smiles at the adorable (he had to admit that was the only way to describe it) way that Milo kept tripping over things or stumbling because he was too busy staring at the sights around him. He even found Milo's awkwardness with the princess cute to watch, though he did feel a tinge of jealousy toward her. At dinner that night, he sat near Milo and Kida, listening to them still talking about the crew's names. \"...and the little digging animal called Mole...he is your pet?\" the princess asked. Rourke snickered to himself as Milo answered. \"Close enough.\" Mole chose that moment to belch loudly, much to the annoyance of everyone, Atlantean and foreign. They never should have trusted her. That was all Rourke could think as he watched Helga's goon yank Milo roughly out of the water by his hair, ignoring his cries of pain. She'd just revealed that she had the missing page to the Shepherd's Journal AND that everyone-except Rourke, whose hands were tied behind him with a soldier on either side-was in on her plan to steal the Heart of Atlantis. Another soldier yanked Kida out when she surfaced. The two got dressed with guns pointed at their heads. It made Rourke sick to know that everyone had finally started acting friendlier toward Milo, and making him think he was accepted, only to now reveal that they were just using him the whole time, that they never really cared about him at all. They had double crossed him, and the poor linguist hadn't been prepared for it. With a gun trained on the princess, she shoved the page in his pace again and this time Milo obeyed, knowing that was the only thing he COULD do, as hie and Kida both had their hands bound. Helga took the lead, grabbing Milo's arm and roughly dragging him toward the palace, where Vinny blew the doors apart. Rourke didn't hear much of what was said, though he cringed when Helga kicked the old king hard in the gut and sent him crumpling to the floor, Sweet declaring that this was not part of the plan. Rourke was watching Milo try and fight the tears that wanted to fall. He was surprised how much it hurt him to see the scholar like that. It was more than just the feeling he should protect him, it was the fact that seeing Milo hurt made HIM hurt as well. He watched helplessly as Helga and her big goon dragged Milo and Kida down into the crystal chamber with them. When they returned, Kida was now a crystalline version of herself. She was sealed into an airtight, watertight container and winched up into the back of one of the two trucks. Milo tried one last time to plead with everyone that what they were doing was wrong. They gave him sad, apologetic looks, but continued their tasks. Helga then told Milo he could stay and become \"part of the exhibit\". Which, of course, really meant he could stay and die. The sergeant announced that they were ready to go as Helga ran through a checklist out loud. Only then were Milo and Rourke freed from their bonds. Helga gave a nod to the goon after they were freed, and the huge man suddenly whirled around and slammed his fist into Milo's face, earning a collective gasp from the Atlanteans as the scholar flew backward, his glasses flipping off his face. Milo landed sprawled on his back, his lip and nose bleeding as he felt around searching for his glasses. There were big bruises on his arms from being so roughly dragged around. His treasured photograph of his grandfather came out of his bag, the goon stepping on it with a mocking sneer on his face as the glass crunched under his foot. He dropped Milo's glasses on the ground beside him. Immediately, Rourke was at his side, carefully handing them to Milo while glaring daggers at the traitors. He took hold of Milo's hand, helping him up. A slamming door caught his attention, and then Audrey was at Milo's side too. A second later, Vinny joined them, followed by Cookie and Mole and finally Packard. He couldn't believe it. Milo had gotten through to them. Or at least seeing his face still so determined even with blood dripping down it had. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to convince Helga as she tried to argue the others back and they held firm in their protests. Finally, she gave up. \"If that's the way you want it, fine. More for me.\" she declared. With that, she climbed into one of the trucks and signaled to the driver of the other. \"Move out!\" I want to thank my frie nd pankeiki-pandemic for giving me the idea for the thing with the car horn.

He doesn't bite… often.\" When Helga first went to pick up the linguist, she didn't expect that he would be so… small. He was like a little puppy, all timid and jumpy. Still, he had fire, given the way he stood up to his bosses earlier that day. Not many day to day workers would threaten to quit over a single trip. That took guts. He had stammered his way through her charms as well, though it seemed like he was barely able to. He was the grandson of Thaddeus Thatch, which spoke highly in his favor, given how driven and determined Thaddeus had been to complete the search for the Journal. Well, now that they had the linguist they had a full team of people for the Atlantis expedition. Mister Whitmore must be over the moon. Rourke would be, too. They finally had the last piece they needed. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Thatch.\" Welcome, indeed. The boy clearly didn't know enough about Rourke, and went in for a handshake. Rourke, as usual, ignored the attempt and got straight down to business. She didn't know what he was thinking, trying to shake Rourke's hand. Maybe he was just being nice. Well, he would learn soon enough that Rourke didn't do nice. Of course they had to give him their undivided attention. It was the slide show that got her attention. Not the picture of him in his bathing suit, that was just embarrassing. But the mention of a great Leviathan was something worth taking note of. It could be rumors, but the alternative was far more lethal. When Rourke got called back to the front viewport, she thought that the idea of a Leviathan would be put to rest. What she got instead was a massive ship graveyard that ranged from all eras. This monstrous defender was seeming more and more plausible by the second. When the thing itself appeared, she was shocked by the sheer size of it, given that it had to be twice or three times the size of their own submarine. All of that awe bled out when cold, hard training took over. They needed to get to the escape pods, and fast. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Move it people! Sometime today would be nice!\" She watched as they piled in, one by one. She relaxed a little when she saw the linguist get in, at least the expedition wouldn't end here. Helga refused to let it end here. She scrambled with Rourke to the cockpit, vaguely hearing Packard sound of the evacuation alert one last time. THe moment she was in her seat Helga was trying to open the bay doors, but the damned lever was stuck. While she struggled with the lever, she heard Rourke say something demanding and passive aggressive to try and hurry her up. She focused on making the lever work, barely giving a retort. There was work to do. With one final kick, the lever was free and the doors were open. Seconds later she was steering their shuttle out of the bay and away from the fight. Thatch said to look for a crevice, and once they had found it the only hurdle left was getting in before the titanic machine sunk them all. As they bounced around in their seats, she couldn't help but notice that aside from his whining, the linguist was taking this far better than anyone would have expected. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Seven hours ago, we started this expedition with two hundred of the finest men and women I've ever known. We're all that's left.\" As Helga closed her eyes in honor of the fallen, a sliver of her couldn't help but be glad that she had been part of the surviving crew. The moment she thought it, of course, was followed by a twinge of guilt over celebrating their survival. They were the only ones who made it. Still, they had a job to do, and now was the time to do it. Rourke got back into his bravado quickly, barking orders and generally acting imposing. With that, the moment was over, and it was time to work. Helga made sure that all the people were in their proper places, especially Vinny. It was better for everyone if he didn't get near the oil rig again. She didn't want a repeat of the Iceland fiasco. She was glad that someone had stopped that incessant honking, it was getting on her nerves. Looking over, she saw that it was Thatch who had been honking the horn, and Rourke had come over to stop it. Since Rourke had decided to see to Milo personally, she assumed that the linguist was ready to go. She hoped he was. After all, the rest of the expedition depended on his ability to read that book. Their lives depended on how he read that book. No pressure. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx She had to admit, Milo was exceeding her expectations. When they had started out, she was sure Milo would be nothing but trouble. After they had revoked his driving privileges, there hadn't been a single problem from him. The little nerd had spades of determination, wanting to deal with all of the hardships on the journey in silence. He was nothing if not dedicated to the cause, seeing as he always had his head stuck in that book. Thankfully he had only ever made one mistake when it came to guiding them along the highway. As Helga watched him, she started to realize that her heart would race every time they made eye contact. At first she ignored it, thinking it was just adrenaline or something else. However, as time passed and they continued to progress further into the Atlantean highway, she found she couldn't ignore the feeling any longer. This was going to become a problem. She couldn't be infatuated with him, could she? After all, he wasn't anywhere near her type. When she went for men, she usually went for the strong yet mentally challenged type. But as the days passed, she knew she would be fooling herself if she thought otherwise. She had fallen for the little nerd, and if she wasn't careful she could jeopardize the entire mission. This was still a mission for money. They had to secure the crystal and take it back to the surface, sure, but after that they would sell it to the highest bidder, and live a life of luxury, all of their dreams within their reach. It wasn't a very ambitious plan, she knew, but it was ambitious enough that it would work. Unfortunately, they still didn't know if Milo would play ball with them on selling the crystal, and as the days passed she became more and more certain that he wouldn't. But that didn't matter. She wouldn't throw away the biggest payday of her life over a simple crush. That's what it was, a crush. It couldn't be anything more, after all. She hadn't known him long enough for anything to be there more than passing fancy. When it came down to it, it was a life of luxury versus a crush on a linguist. There was no question which one was the better option. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Get some water on that fire!\" \"No time! Get us into those caves, move it!\" This couldn't be happening. The entire camp was going up in flames. How had this started? She had no idea. By the time she had woken up, half of the tents had been engulfed in flames. It's a good thing that Milo had been shouting, or else some of them wouldn't have made it. Milo. Well, now she knew what started the fire. She had to admit that no matter how cute he was, and she had finally come to terms with the fact that she thought he was cute, he was a bit of a problem for this expedition. Whether it was misreading the map and leading them into a giant centipede den, or drinking the last of Vinny's nitroglycerin, the boy was guaranteed to make some kind of inconvenience through pure accident. With a shake of her head, Helga put her concentration back on the task at hand. As she jumped into her rig, she watched the rest of the crew move with quick efficiency to gather all of the supplies needed. Rourke hadn't been exaggerating when he had said they were the finest men and women he had worked with, these people didn't buckle under any kind of pressure. Driving the rig across the bridge was something she needed to keep focused on, she couldn't have herself get distracted at a time like this. As she heard the bridge crack and crumble, the only thing she could do was try and hold her wheel steady The rig was careening out of her control. As she fought to keep it steady, she heard the screech of the digger's wheels as they helplessly tried to find traction. Looking up, the last thing Helga saw was the back of the digger slamming into her windshield. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Mister Thatch, what do you think? Mister Thatch?\" Funny how little things can make someone panic so much. Milo was missing. She hadn't thought to check for him in the aftermath of the fall, assuming he would be sitting down somewhere trying catching his breath. After he didn't respond to Rourke, however, she was concerned. He wasn't one to play dead, so that meant he was either out of earshot or… No. He was okay. He had to be okay, because she didn't know what she'd do if he wasn't. This was troubling, to say the least. When had he become so important to her? Never mind, that wasn't important right now. All that mattered was finding Milo so she could strangle him for scaring her. Or possibly hit him until she felt better. As she and the rest of the crew began their search, she heard a clatter of rocks falling. A disturbance off down the cave. As she got closer, signaling that she had heard something, she could make out the sounds of a person scrambling around, followed by Milo's voice, though she couldn't make out what he was saying. \"It seems like we know where Mister Thatch went, sir.\" She said, turning her head to hide a ghost of a smile. \"It would appear so, Lieutenant. Well, what are you waiting for? Get us moving, now!\" As she got back into her damaged rig, she promised herself that she was going to smack that genius of a moron silly when she found him. She threw the rig into gear as she lost herself in thought. Yes, smacking that little nerd would make her feel much better today. That should teach him to scare her like that. She paused as the digger made it's way through the rock walls. She really had been scared, hadn't she? That was something else that she needed to make sure was in check. She couldn't go around losing her head because the liability of the group had wandered off to play with paste. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx When the digger finally broke through the wall, Helga was at a loss for words. There was an island sitting there, with wildlife flying around it. This was so much more than what they had expected to find. She was so in awe that the movement behind her almost went unnoticed. Almost. The moment she heard the scuffle of rocks she was going for her pistol. She watched as a group of what had to be natives surrounded their small crew. The island had been farfetched enough, but people? This was getting into the realm of fantasy. There weren't supposed to be people here. This changed everything. They were supposed to find this crystal amidst a bunch of broken pots and dusty artifacts, not in a living, thriving island. What if the locals refused to play along? What if they tried to fight back? She watched as Milo began to speak what must have been Atlantean to the leader of the natives. Milo, of course, wouldn't have accepted selling the crystal when it was just an archeological find, what would happen now? He'd do worse now, he would try to stop them. As much as she liked him, a crush just wasn't worth throwing away the once in a lifetime opportunity to become instantly rich. Her heart gave a twinge as she thought about how this would go. But she knew what she had to do. She'd speak with Rourke, he would make a decision, and that would be it. If he changed his mind, that'd be fine. If he didn't, well, she'd given it her best shot. As the Atlanteans mingled with the crew, she couldn't help but hold back on the conversation. Best not to get too attached to these people. They might be the enemy later on.. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Milo was babbling a mile a minute. She kept up her pretenses with the bored look, but she couldn't help but smile at the adorable way he talked. As they crossed the bridge, Helga's mind started to wander. There was no way that Milo would be okay with what was eventually going to happen, not as it was now. The only way that there could be anything between her and Milo was if Rourke suddenly decided to change his mind. And she knew how often Rourke changed his mind. \"Commander, there were not supposed to be people down here. This changes everything.\" \"This changes nothing.\" That was it, she guessed. She had made an effort, but the plan continued regardless of her feelings on the subject. Not that she had expected it to go any other way, to be honest. Rourke wasn't a kind person, nor was he indecisive. He was their leader, and this was the biggest payday they'd ever had a chance at, of course he wouldn't back down when complications arose. The rest of the drive passed in relative silence from two of the three people in the car, while Milo managed to talk enough for three people by himself. He really was like a kid at christmas, and she still couldn't help but smile at the way his eyes lit up while he talked. This really wasn't about the money for him. It was an odd feeling, realizing he was in this expedition solely because of his scientific curiosity and love for adventure. Helga shook her head, wiping the smile off her face. This wasn't the time to be daydreaming. They still didn't know if they were going to stay as long as they needed to. Thankfully, Rourke was an accomplished negotiator, even if it seemed the opposite. She got the news when he returned. They were given a single night to rest and resupply. That settled it, they moved on the crystal tonight. She only hoped Milo would be willing to stay with them. She chuckled lowly at the thought. Like there was any chance. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Have a nice swim?\" \"Hey guys. Wha-what's going on? What's with all the guns?\" This was it. This was the moment where it all came together. This was where Milo found the crystal for them and they secured it for transport to the surface. The dawning realization in his innocent eyes was too much to bear, so Helga found herself looking away. By the time she looked back, he had leveled his glare right at her. That glare stabbed her harder than anything she'd felt before. Guilt wasn't something she had expected to feel, but that glare hit her with so much guilt she was forced to look away again. Then he did something they never expected him to do. He resisted Rourke. He stood up to the most intimidating men she'd ever met. It was hard to suppress her smile as the tiny man stood up to over two hundred pounds of muscle and cold, hard experience. Just when she thought he couldn't surprise her any more he said something that almost made her change her mind about the entire operation. \"You think it's some kind of a diamond, I thought it was some kind of a battery, but we're both wrong. It's their life force. That crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive, you take that away and they'll die!\" \"Well, that changes things. Helga, what do you think?\" Their life force? That…that didn't change anything. They were too far in to back out now. They'd done too much, worked too hard, and sacrificed too many people to let something get in their way now, right at the end. Milo couldn't understand that, he wasn't in this for the money. He would never understand the idea of making a choice for the long term. \"Knowing that…\" Helga hid her eyes from Milo as she forced a smile.. \"...I'd double the price.\" \"I was thinking triple.\" xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"So, I guess this is how it ends, huh?\" Helga gripped the wheel as she heard Milo start to talk. She didn't need to be told that this was bad. She knew what she was doing was wrong, but she had done enough wrong to know that this would just be another mark against her. Her nerves getting the better of her, she turned back just in time to see Rourke throw his punch right at Milo's face. Her knuckles turned white as she held herself in check. It was all she could do to keep from getting out of the truck and clocking her superior officer. Then, to her disbelief, Audrey got out of her truck and walked over to Milo. Then Vinny, Cookie and Mole. When even Packard left she didn't try to hide the disbelief on her face. They were all going to stay behind and die? How could they? Hadn't they all come this close to the end, this close to their dreams coming true? The end was in sight and Rourke would be the only other person who was going to keep the payday. How could they all throw away their dreams over a simple moral dilemma? Helga put the truck into gear and drove off without a word. Fine, if they wanted to drop their dreams and do the right thing, that was their choice. She had a dream to fulfill. Helga ignored the pain in her chest at the fact that Milo hadn't tried to convince her, too. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Nothing personal.\" She was falling. How dare he. How dare Rourke do this to her. After everything they had been through, everything she had sacrificed and done to make sure that this happened. She felt a twinge as she remembered Milo's glare. Milo. She had left him behind for this. She had doomed an entire civilization to get that blimp in the air. She had thrown away her chances at a life for this expedition. All that, to be thrown away like trash at the very end? To be discarded and set aside like she was nothing more than extra luggage. No. If she was going to be cut out of the deal, then she was gonna burn the deal to the ground. She leveled her flare gun at the blimp as it floated ever higher. Nothing personal, but NOBODY would get out of here with that crystal. Least of all Rourke. Holding her arm steady, she lined up the shot. Right to the main balloon, that should teach Rourke a valuable lesson in team synergy. \"Nothing… personal…\" Helga muttered under her breath as she pulled the trigger, igniting the flare as it sailed into the balloon.. She watched with a twinge of satisfaction as the main balloon went up in flames, sending the entire rig down towards the bottom of the shaft. This was it. She was finally done, and there was no way that Rourke would get out of here alive. She writhed in pain as she watched the rig hit the ground, sending debris scattering across the floor. She was dimly aware of Milo's voice nearby, but she was just too tired to care at the moment. Her eyes slipped closed as a pair of boots crossed her vision. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Helga…. Helga, wake up. It's okay, now, you're safe.\" Helga's eyes opened to the sound of a familiar voice. As her eyes adjusted to the light, she realized that she was laying in the middle of Atlantis. She tried to sit up, but a pair of hands gently pushed her back down, and she turned her head to see Milo standing above her. \"Thatch? What... what happened? How did I get here?\" Her voice was weak, and she fell into a fit of coughing after having spoken. \"You're okay now, but you need your rest. You had a pretty hard fall and you'll need some healing before you're fully recovered. As for how you got here, well, I noticed you lying on the floor not too far from where the dirigible had landed. I couldn't just leave you there, so I had Audrey and Vinny take you on their speeder while I made sure Kida's cell was secure.\" His voice was so calm, so matter of fact, as if he hadn't done anything special. As if he hadn't saved her life through his actions. Still, it didn't add up. Didn't he hate her? He hadn't called out to her like he had to everyone else in the crew. Wasn't that because he thought she was beyond saving? \"But, why me? Why did you save me?\" she asked, confusion clear in her voice.. Milo looked at her like she was the one saying something strange. \"Why wouldn't I save you? Nobody deserves to die like that. Not for profit, not for science, and certainly not for revenge. That's what I had been saying the whole time.\" It was so pure hearted, so naive, that she couldn't help but smile at Milo. He was so good, and he had no idea how much his kindness affected others. How much it meant to her. She was done fighting it, and she shouldn't have tried to in the first place. She was in love with this foolish man, and there was no way she was going to hold back. With an almost desperate fervor, Helga pulled Milo in and brought her lips to his. Milo made a confused noise as she kissed him, but soon enough he just accepted the kiss, returning it with the same passion as her. Eventually they both began to run out of breath, and broke apart, foreheads touching as they stared at one another. \"You're one of a kind, Thatch.\" Helga said, a smirk playing across her lips. \"I guess I am.\" He says, still dazed from the kiss. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \"Atlantis will honor your names forever.\" They had all received honorary crystals, and were being given a rather massive pile of gold and jewelry. Apparently, it did pay to be the good guy. Helga stood off to the side, her neck bare. Of course she wouldn't get an honorary crystal, she wasn't one of the good guys. To be honest, she was surprised that they were letting her hitch a ride to the surface. It wasn't as if they owed her anything. She was mostly just thankful that they wouldn't be stabbing her and had helped her recover, even if it was under Milo's orders. Milo, the name made her heart beat faster and her face grow red. She couldn't help it now, she was far gone for the goofy linguist. But she knew him well enough after all of this adventure, and he knew she didn't stand a chance against the Atlantean princess, Kidagakash. Kida was pure, pretty, and just as interested in Milo as she was, Helga was sure. It made sense, after all. He had always wanted to find Atlantis, what better a place for him to stay? Helga had heard Kida ask him last night. She hadn't waited to hear him say yes. Her heart couldn't take it. It didn't help that nothing had happened after the first kiss they had shared. No, her royal highness had made sure of that. There wasn't a moment where Helga and Milo had been alone after that, whether it was one of the crew coming to talk to Milo or another Atlantean asking him for help interpreting some rune on the other side of Atlantis. It didn't matter now, her window was closed. They were gathering for one last photo in front of the fish, as Sweet had so eloquently put it. Helga remained where she was, certain nobody wanted the \"last bad guy in town\" as Cookie had put it, in the photo. \"Hold up, guys! We're missing someone.\" Milo gestured towards her as he spoke, making Helga reluctantly step forward. \"Helga, come on, you need to be in this picture too.\" She felt the princesses glare from across the landing pad, but did nothing to stop Milo from pulling her right next to him for the photo. She felt utterly content when his arm wrapped around her shoulder and pulled her close. She was sure her blush would show up on the photograph, to say nothing of her smile. \"Say Gochk.\" \"Gochk.\" The flash didn't quite reach her eyes, making Helga think that perhaps the camera had been angled wrong. If that meant that her blush was invisible to the camera, well there wasn't anything she could do. As they all dispersed to finish loading up the fish, Helga couldn't resist the urge to kiss Milo on the cheek one last time, even if it was in front of the princess. Her lips ghosted his left cheek for a second, just barely making contact. \"Goodbye, Milo. Enjoy Atlantis.\" she said, her eyes flickering towards the ground as she walked away. She made it four steps before Milo grabbed her shoulder. \"Goodbye? What are you talking about, Helga? I'm coming with you.\" His voice was unsure, as if he didn't know why she had said what she words were more than enough to stop her dead in her tracks. She whirled around, staring him dead in the eye. \"What?\" \"You heard me. I'm going with you.\" She couldn't believe it. He was giving up a life with a princess and his dream world. For what? For her? \"But you're perfect here. This is where you belong.\" \"I belong with a woman who is very special to me, and there's nothing else to it. Besides, who's to say that I couldn't come back here to visit and teach them?\" Milo's words struck her like a hammer. Why had nobody else thought about that? It's not like the Atlantean speeders were lacking a fuel source. But, what was that about a woman who was special to him? Did that mean what she thought it did? She was at a loss for words. All Helga could do was sputter as Milo's arms wrapped around her and held her close. He had chosen her over Kida? How was this possible. She wasn't the good guy. She wasn't supposed to get a happy ending. \"Are… are you sure, Milo?\" She asked, cursing the way her voice faltered mid sentence. \"Absolutely. On a side note, would you like to go to Coney Island with me some time? They have some mean bumper cars.\" She couldn't believe what she was hearing. Was he actually asking her out on a date? Only Milo would try to be assertive with a date to Coney Island, of all places. Helga couldn't suppress the chuckle, and found that she wasn't the only one. The entire group had overheard their conversation, and the reactions ranged from shock to uncontrollable mirth. Sweet walked over and slapped Milo's back, a mirthful grin on his kindly face. \"Better watch out, Helga. This one's a keeper.\" Helga's grin widened at Sweet's words. \"Don't I know it.\" ","Summary":" \"And, relax.

Disclaimer : Disney Studios, Tab Murphy, Gary Trousdale, et Kirk Wise. N/A: Merci à toutes les personnes du discord qui se reconnaîtront :D all your warlike men in a body sank - Je suis Kida – Kidagakash Nedakh. Le Roi, mon père, va vouloir vous rencontrer, tint-elle à leur préciser, son sourire timide. Son regard curieux glisse sur chacun des membres de l'expédition, ses yeux d'un bleu clair et inconnu; le climat est tropical, humide – dur de croire qu'ils sont encore dans une cave et pas à l'air libre, à subir les embruns de l'Atlantique… Mais Helga Sinclair n'est pas là pour badiner : sa mission dépasse les lubies du vieux Whitmore et les rêves de gosse de Milo Thatch. - Nous conduiriez-vous à lui, Mademoiselle Kida ? S'avance Rourke, un peu trop poliment pour qu'Helga se force à retenir un soupir exaspéré. Lyle était un bon chef d'expédition, un meneur d'homme solide, mais un piètre menteur; Helga avait vu clair dans son jeu à la seconde où il l'avait invitée boire un verre dans un bar de pêcheurs islandais qui sentait le moisi et quelque chose comme de la bouillabaisse. Il voulait fêter la réussite de leur expédition en Islande, et n'arrêtait pas de brandir le Manuscrit du Berger comme s'il s'agissait d'un carnet de chèque – il l'avait même brièvement utilisé comme un dessous de verre, avant qu'un coup d'œil meurtrier d'Helga ne l'en dissuade. Mademoiselle Kida accepte bien volontiers de les conduire à son père, Milo déjà fourré dans ses pattes à lui poser toutes sortes de questions aussi indiscrètes que farfelues auxquelles elle répond vivement en hochant la tête, n'hésitant pas à demander à son tour tout un tas de détails que Mr Thatch était bien en mal de lui expliquer sans se mettre à bafouiller terriblement. - En vérité, nous n'espérions plus trouver, lui avoua-t-il, tout penaud. Même avec tout l'argent que Whitmore leur avait jeté à la figure, Helga s'était jurée de ne croire à rien tant que leur seule preuve était un cahier de vacances rempli de gribouillages illisibles – peu importe que Thatch puisse leur faire une traduction minute : Rourke ne savait pas lire l'Atlante et ça ne l'avait pas empêché d'arracher la page la plus intéressante du bouquin avant de lui lâcher dans les mains. (Helga n'avait eu qu'à patiemment la recopier une fois de retour à leur hôtel, en Islande. Qui aurait cru qu'un gros dur comme Lyle Tiberius Rourke ne tenait pas bien l'alcool ?) - C'est par ici, les invita Kida à sa suite, empruntant le petit pont de bois qui reliait leur petit bout de falaise jusqu'à l'île paradisiaque étonnamment circulaire qui se tenait au centre de la cave. Si le Manuscrit n'avait pas menti au sujet de l'emplacement de l'Atlantide, il était logique de croire qu'il n'avait pas menti au sujet du cristal; Rourke se voyait déjà le sortir par la cheminée de cet ancien volcan semi-éteint, dont la lave bouillonnait sous leurs pieds. - Thatch, avec moi – nous prenons le véhicule 3, et nous ouvrons la marche, leur apprit Lyle en prenant la place du conducteur, ordonnant à l'équipe deux de récupérer ce qu'ils pouvaient après l'effondrement du pont de pierre. Helga monte à sa suite sans se poser de question, bras croisés et décidée à ne pas se plaindre de l'humidité ambiante; Milo Thatch et ses élucubrations linguistiques sur l'atlante les accompagneraient déjà pendant toute la traversée… Et même si elle faisait l'effort d'y prêter une oreille attentive, Helga ne voyait absolument pas ce que le sumérien venait faire là-dedans. C'était évidemment du latin, avec quelques bases grammaticales grecques. - il y en a un qui s'amuse, au moins, marmonna Rourke distraitement, ses scrutant avidement chaque nouvelle structure atlante dévoilée par la brume. Le vieux rêve du grand-père de Milo prenait finalement forme – avec un peu plus d'indigènes que prévu, mais c'était un bon début – Helga n'attendait plus que de rencontrer le fameux Roi dont Kida avait parlé, même si ça compliquait un peu les choses. - Restons calmes, leur conseilla Rourke en descendant des véhicules. Je vais aller à la rencontre du Roi avec Mr Thatch… Lieutenant, vous nous accompagnez. Evidemment , Helga eut-elle envie de maugréer. Sans sa capacité à transcrire les aboiements de Rourke en ordres compréhensibles, ils ne seraient pas allés bien loin. Kida les précède dans ce qui ressemble à une salle du trône, où l'eau est omniprésente et d'une clarté étonnante, si bien qu'en regardant son reflet dans l'eau stagnante qui les sépare du Roi de l'Atlantide, Helga a l'impression de marcher sur un miroir. Ils parlent avec grande vigueur, et Milo ne saisit pas tout. Leur désaccord est manifeste; c'est facile de deviner que sans leur linguiste, ils auraient sans doute terminé dans la lave. Rourke, évidemment, ne l'entend pas de cette oreille. - Nous ne sommes que de pacifiques explorateurs – des Hommes de science, s'explique-t-il avec insistance. Il n'en est pas au point de le supplier mais il s'en approche tranquillement; les yeux voilés du Roi sont peut-être inexpressifs et aveugles, pourtant il a l'air d'y voir plus clair que Kida ou Milo qui ne se doute toujours de rien. L'équipage entier est décidé à ramener une preuve, de préférence un gros cristal sur lequel ils se sont bien documentés qui leur rapportera un paquet d'argent. Helga Katrina Sinclair est là pour tout le reste. - Une nuit, consent finalement le Roi après de courtes négociations et l'intervention de Thatch qui aura réussi à calmer le jeu. Rourke a décidément des talents cachés. Helga ne l'imaginait pas si magnanime – bien qu'apparemment le cirage de pompe fasse partie de ses capacités. Il s'empresse évidemment d'interroger Thatch sur le morceau de dialogue qu'ils n'ont pas pu comprendre, ou seulement en hachuré; il confirme ce qu'Helga soupçonnait. - Ils s'entendent comme-ci, comme ça… Elle nous aime bien mais lui, il est plus méfiant, leur répondit Milo sans s'avancer plus que ça, incertain vis-à-vis de l'attitude du vieux Roi de l'Atlantide. - Il nous cacherait quelque chose selon vous, Mr Thatch ? - Peut-être, j'en sais rien, fit-il en haussant les épaules, se dandinant d'un pied sur l'autre avant de se mettre à fouiller dans son sac. Il faut que je relise mes notes… - Si c'est le cas, je veux savoir ce que c'est, exigea immédiatement Rourke. - Nous pourrions le savoir en charmant la Princesse, plaisanta-t-elle à moitié en échangeant un regard calculateur avec lui. Si Kida avait soif de connaissances, ça n'allait pas se reporter sur un vieux crabe comme Lyle Tiberius Rourke ou sur cet animal de Gaëtan Molière – non, ce serait forcément sur le jeune Milo Thatch. L'équipage, en tout cas, semblait conquis par l'idée. - Il faudrait quelqu'un de diplomate, approuva le Dr Gentil en faisant mine de se creuser la tête. - Histoire de creuser la question, oui, en convint leur expert en explosifs. Thatch avait déjà un crayon perché sur une oreille lorsque Rourke se pencha vers lui, histoire de lui suggérer franchement l'idée; le brave garçon n'a pourtant pas l'air très dégourdi, aussi Helga décide-t-elle de le suivre discrètement. Histoire d'être sûre. Ce n'est pas comme si le long regard insistant de la Princesse avait quelque chose à voir là-dedans. - Miss Sinclair, vous m'accompagnez ? S'en étonna d'ailleurs Thatch en la voyant s'adosser à un pilier au lieu de suivre le reste de l'équipe. - Eh bien, nous ne sommes pas sûrs que les atlantes aient les mêmes coutumes que nous, pas vrai ? Supposa-t-elle à voix haute en prenant son air le plus désintéressé. Peut-être qu'elle préfère les femmes, allez savoir… Un petit rire nerveux secoua Thatch qui devint franchement rouge, visiblement très mal à l'aise à l'idée que leur échange avec la Princesse ne soit pas strictement scientifique. Helga, ayant été entraînée à cette possibilité par ses autres employeurs, s'y voyait déjà (Mr Whitmore est peut-être riche, mais rien ne valait quelques sécurités financières supplémentaires et l'appui d'une puissance maritime comme le Royaume-Uni et son très pratique Commonwealth). - Vous – vous n'êtes pas sérieuse, hein ? Helga n'a pas de temps à perdre avec ses questions; Kida ne perd pas de temps en sortant de la salle du trône, et elle non plus. - Kida ! Ose-t-elle en se rapprochant, Thatch dans les pattes. - Oh, vous êtes toujours là, lui répondit-elle, son regard bleu soudain plus brillant que le cristal autour de son cou. - Nous voudrions en savoir plus, balbutia Milo en essuyant ses lunettes sur le bord de son marcel. - Ah, ça tombe bien, moi aussi, s'en félicita la princesse. Suivez-moi ! Elle n'a pas la patience de les attendre et les attrape par le poignet pour les traîner à sa suite à travers des ruines mangées par la mousse et entourées d'une forêt luxuriante; l'air y est toujours aussi humide, mais il y fait plus frais, plus sombre. - D'où vous venez alors ? Vous êtes nos premiers visiteurs depuis des siècles, se lamenta-t-elle en sautant d'une colonne renversée, les invitant d'un geste à la suivre. Toi, commença-t-elle en précipitant Milo en bas, tu dois être un scientifique. T'es pas bâti pour les travaux d'extérieur ! Helga ne peut pas s'empêcher de ricaner bêtement, d'échanger un regard bref avec la princesse. - Et toi, je sais pas trop, fit-elle mine de se poser la question. Tu dois sûrement être un général. Pourquoi est-ce cet autre type qui parlait à ta place tout à l'heure ? Il n'avait pas l'air très malin, marmonna Kida en croisant les bras. - La hiérarchie, princesse, lui répondit-elle en haussant les épaules. Vous connaissez sûrement ? - Oh, on peut se tutoyer… Sous l'océan, tout le monde est égal, pas vrai ? Elle lui fait un clin d'œil, avant de se tourner vers Milo qui l'intéresse tout autant; elle lui demande d'où ils viennent, ce qui s'est passé depuis le déluge et même de quelle couleur est le ciel. - Woah, du calme, l'arrête immédiatement Thatch, incapable de suivre le rythme d'enfer de la princesse. Une question chacun, ça me parait plus raisonnable. Je te réponds, tu me réponds ? Osa-t-il un peu moins timidement qu'auparavant. - D'accord, d'accord… Tu commences, alors, lui accorda-t-elle ce privilège. Il a l'air d'y réfléchir une seconde, et Helga en profite pour grimper à la suite de Kida sur un bout de vieille pierre. - Comment est-ce que tout ça est arrivé ici ? Vous étiez à la surface, et puis soudain… ? - Il est dit que les dieux étaient devenus jaloux de notre peuple, de notre civilisation… - Sympa le panthéon, ne put s'empêcher de remarquer Helga. Le regard attristé de Kida croise le sien, mais elle lui sourit, juste un peu; Milo a l'air autant désolé qu'elle. - Un grand cataclysme, soupira-t-elle, se remettant à arpenter les ruines. Je me rappelle encore des nuages noirs, des éclairs qui grondaient – et puis il y a eu une explosion de lumière, leur raconta Kida, s'adossant à un pilier coupé en deux. - Tu t'en rappelles ? Releva Helga sans vouloir comprendre. - Oui… J'étais petite, mais mon père m'a raconté que la lumière était venue pour ma mère, et je ne l'ai plus jamais revue, leur avoua la princesse. - Oh, je suis désolé – j'ai perdu mes parents très jeune moi aussi et je… Attends une minute ! S'écria-t-il en comprenant où Helga voulait en venir. Comment tu peux t'en souvenir ? C'est arrivé il y a – - Longtemps, oui, s'en amusa-t-elle en se retenant de maugréer un pas trop tôt, Thatch . - Ça voudrait dire que tu aurais huit mille, huit mille huit cent ans ? Lui demanda-t-il, incrédule, après avoir compté sur ses doigts. Kida a l'air presque déçue qu'il pointe quelque chose d'aussi évident avec autant d'étonnement – ses questions sur le déluge font soudain sens, la façon dont elle leur a demandé ce qui s'était passé et d'où ils venaient. Helga doutait que leurs réponses lui parlent beaucoup. - Même ma grand-mère n'est pas aussi bien conservée, plaisanta-t-elle avec un sourire amène. Comment pouvez-vous paraître si jeunes après autant de millénaires ? L'air souterrain conserve, osa-t-elle supposer, moqueuse. - C'est plus compliqué que ça, fit Kida en évitant sa question. - Et toi, que voulais-tu nous demander ? La réponse fuse. - Comment vous êtes arrivés jusqu'ici ? - Grâce à ceci… Thatch semblait capable de donner des réponses simples, de temps à autre; il tend le Manuscrit du Berger à la princesse qui s'en saisit, aussi avide que Rourke lorsqu'ils avaient finalement exhumé l'ouvrage en Islande. - En quelques jours. Grâce à un sous-marin, précisa Helga, pince sans rire. L'attention toute entière de Kida s'était portée sur le livre, dont elle traçait chaque ligne du bout des doigts; Helga, comme Rourke et Whitmore, s'était demandée comment diable des informations aussi précieuses que précises avaient pu terminer dans un vieux manuscrit. Elle avait fini par se dire que c'était sûrement un atlante qui avait fait le chemin inverse du leur, et ne s'était plus vraiment posé la question. - Vous pouvez lire tout ça ?! Elle leur colle le livre sous le nez, et oh mon Dieu – il a toujours cette vieille odeur de poisson pourri. - Milo peut – il est linguiste, s'en enorgueillit bêtement Helga en désignant Thatch d'un signe de la tête. - Je suis polyglotte, aussi, ajouta-t-il en bombant le torse. C'est mon métier – mais j'ai une autre question qui – Apparemment, la patience et la discrétion n'était pas des qualités très masculines; soucieux de plaire à Rourke, Milo avait copié l'insistance crasse de celui-ci. - Tu peux le lire, alors ?! Tout ? - Oui, je peux lire l'atlante, répondit-il, tout penaud. - Tu ne sais pas le lire, princesse ? Le regard bleu de Kida s'attarde dans le sien, comme ennuyé. - Personne ne le lit, siffla-t-elle. Ce savoir s'est perdu après le Meh-behl-moak. Helga interroge Milo du regard. - Le Déluge, expliqua-t-il dans un murmure. - Apprenez-moi, exigea-t-elle alors, rendant le livre à Thatch. Il se met à lire un passage en marchant, Kida à sa gauche; Helga les suit sans s'imposer, bien incapable de suivre la conversation davantage. Poser des questions, oui – parler atlante, c'était pas compris dans sa paye. - Helga, vous venez ? Ils se retournent vers elle, l'air un peu désolés de s'être emportés; Kida vient à sa rencontre, touche son épaule et la guide aux côtés de Milo qui s'apprête à tourner une page. - Apprends-nous ? Osa-t-elle proposer à Thatch en jouant des cils. Ils se prennent au jeu, lisent quelques lignes chacun; Kida se moque de l'accent campagnard de Milo et de celui trop nasillard d'Helga avant de les guider hâtivement vers un autre coin de la forêt qu'elle a l'air de bien connaitre. . - J'en ai vu des engins, mais celui-là ? Jamais, murmura Helga en s'accroupissant le long du flanc du véhicule atlante. - Je sais, maugréa Kida. Ça fait des siècles que j'essaie de le faire marcher, et rien n'y fait ! Elle donna un coup de rageur dans un caillou, ce qui fit franchement rire Helga; Milo se penchait déjà sur des symboles atlantes gravés dans le métal – la pierre ? – de ce qui devait être un tableau de bord. - Voyons ça de plus prêt… Helga regarde leur petit manège depuis l'arrière du véhicule contre lequel elle s'est appuyée; c'est du bel ouvrage, y a pas à dire. - Vous croyez que ça va à quelle vitesse, ce petit bijou ? Osa-t-elle leur demander. - Sûrement très vite, fit Kida en hochant vigoureusement la tête. - On essaye ? Bouche bée, la princesse acquiesce bêtement et s'installe devant, au poste de pilote; au premier quart de tour du cristal, le véhicule se met à flotter tranquillement au-dessus du sol, si naturellement et confortablement qu'Helga ne se revoit pas monter sur sa moto avant un moment. - Vous montez, Mr Thatch ? Invita-t-elle Milo à les suivre. - Qui ça, moi ? Non, non vraiment je – - Vous faites pas prier, Milo. - D'accord, d'accord – Ils tombent au premier virage un peu trop serré que Kida leur fait prendre – mais ça ne les arrête pas. - La perfection vient avec la pratique, lui promit Helga en aidant Milo, puis la princesse à se relever. Kida garde sa main dans la sienne, plus longtemps que Thatch qui s'était regardé sous toutes les coutures à la recherche d'une coupure; son gant paraît soudain être de trop à Helga, qui n'ose pourtant pas bouger pour l'enlever. - J'ai autre chose à vous montrer, les y invita Kida en les dépassant. Elle les emmène au sommet d'une statue qui dépasse les faux nuages d'Atlantide, là où le vent bat leurs visages et emmêlent leurs cheveux; brièvement, Helga se demande si la nuit telle qu'elle la connaît existe encore ici, si bas sous terre, quand votre monde tout entier est illuminé par de la lave en fusion. Thatch en profite pour jouer au grand sentimental. Mais Helga doit avouer que cet endroit lui plaît bien. . Evidemment, Rourke ne compte pas passer une nuit tranquille (la nuit existe, apparemment); il interroge immédiatement Helga sur la princesse – - Vous n'allez pas me demander sa couleur préférée, quand même ? Soupira-t-elle d'agacement après quelques questions du même genre. - Voyons Lieutenant, même la plus petite information a son importance – mettez ça par ici, ordonna-t-il à quelques-uns des soldats qui les avaient accompagnés en ville, et qui transportaient une longue caisse en bois. Les carabines n'avaient pas pris l'eau, fort heureusement; il leur en restait deux caisses, et ça suffirait bien assez à persuader les atlantes de leur foutre la paix. - Vous croyez vraiment que ça nous sera utile ? Fit-elle en haussant un sourcil à la vue des Springfields alignés dans la boîte. - Helga, je pense que vous savez comme moi que l'échec n'est pas tolérable, trancha-t-il d'un ton final en se saisissant d'un fusil. Elle le regarde charger l'arme, et se sent secouée par un frisson de dégoût pur; bien sûr qu'ils n'allaient pas repartir les mains vides, mais Helga a la sensation d'avoir compris trop tard à quel prix. - Ce sont juste des indigènes, tenta-t-elle en haussant les épaules. Forcez-leur la main, même sans fusils sous le nez ils accepteront… - Je n'en suis pas si sûr, moi, siffla-t-il. Helga, bras croisés, se demande si Mr Thatch n'avait pas eu raison d'expliquer à Kida qu'ils ne s'attendaient pas à trouver grand-chose vivant dans la poche d'air qui abritait la cité et ses habitants. Rourke, lui, avait définitivement envisagé cette possibilité et ne se voyait pas s'épargner ce plaisir coupable. - Dois-je vous rappeler la somme que Mr Whitmore nous paie, Miss Sinclair ? Elle le regarde droit dans les yeux, aussi inflexible que lui. Elle était peut-être jeune quand l'armée impériale a fait feu sur la place du palais d'Hiver de Saint-Pétersbourg, en 1905, mais elle n'oubliera jamais la couleur du sang dans la neige et l'odeur âcre de la poudre; ses cheveux avaient senti des jours durant, pas moyen de faire partir les taches sur son manteau. Ses gants sauveraient peut-être ses mains mais pas son âme. - Pas la peine d'aboyer, Rourke, le rabroua-t-elle en s'éloignant. Je sais très bien que vous ne mordez pas ! Rageuse, Helga ne fait pas vraiment attention où elle va; tout ce qui l'intéresse, c'est s'éloigner du camp et de ces maudits fusils. Ça ne devait être qu'une solution de secours ! - Helga ? La princesse l'observe depuis le haut d'une colonne, où elle attrape des lucioles pour les enfermer dans un globe de verre pendu au bout d'un bâton; comme quoi, ces insectes incendiaires peuvent être dociles si on sait comment les prendre. - Hey, princesse, la salue-t-elle en retour, se forçant à lui sourire, même rien qu'un peu. - Quelque chose ne va pas ? S'enquit Kida en descendant de la colonne. Elle n'a pas envie de lui mentir – mais dire la vérité, qu'est-ce que ça changerait ? - Milo et moi allons plonger dans le lac, tu veux nous accompagner ? La surface miroitante reflète les lucioles, la lueur bleue ou orange des lampes suspendues à travers la ville; c'est magnifique, et ils s'apprêtent à mettre la ville à sac à la recherche d'un cristal dont personne n'a l'air de se souvenir, pas même la princesse. - Je ne suis pas sûre que ce soit une bonne idée, s'excusa-t-elle en rajustant ses gants. Ses mains moites ne lui rendent pas la tâche facile, et Helga se refuse à envisager un plongeon; Thatch était le seul qui sache correctement lire l'atlante, et même un maladroit comme lui doit être capable de retenir sa respiration assez longtemps pour suivre Kida sous l'eau. - Franchement tu devrais venir, insista Kinda en se passant de l'eau sur la nuque, déjà enfoncée jusqu'à la taille dans le lac. Thatch préfère tremper précautionneusement un orteil avant de se lancer; l'eau de ne doit pas être bien fraîche vu la lave qui bouillonne au pied de la cité et l'air tiède mais respirable de la caverne. - Je ne le lis pas l'atlante, moi, contra Helga en repoussant sa tresse par-dessus son épaule, presque dédaigneusement. - Et alors ? Moi non plus, s'empressa de lui répondre Kida en lui faisant un clin d'œil. Helga n'a pas le temps de lui répondre qu'elle a déjà plongé, et Milo à sa suite; il ne reste plus que des petites bulles à la surface du lac, et quelques vaguelettes qui viennent lécher les marches de pierre. Quoiqu'il y ait là-dessous, ça n'allait de toute façon pas lui apprendre grand-chose de nouveau – la page du Manuscrit et ses dessins en disait assez long pour que Rourke ne perde pas une seconde de plus. - Alors, on se mêle aux indigènes ? - Ils ont plongé à la recherche de je-ne-sais-pas-quoi, lui brailla-t-elle en retour, cachant son inconfort à la vue des armes. Elle a toujours son revolver, mais face à la demi-douzaine de soldats armés qui débarque sur la rive, ça ne va pas changer grand-chose. - Un problème, Lieutenant ? - … Rien, maugréa-t-elle en voyant tout le monde s'aligner au bord de l'eau. Même Placard a un flingue. - Peut-être qu'il va nous ramener le cristal, ricana Rourke à voix haute en s'asseyant. Ils finiront bien par remonter de toute façon… Ils se mettent tous à fixer la surface, à guetter avidement la moindre bulle d'air; ça ne tarde pas et Lyle en profite évidemment pour foutre la page qu'il a arrachée sous le nez de Thatch, l'air très satisfait de lui et de sa petite combine. Sauf qu'ils ne sont pas plus proches du cristal maintenant que Milo est au courant du vrai but de leur voyage. - Non, je ne suis pas un mercenaire. Je ne suis pas comme vous ! Je refuse de voler la source vitale de ces gens, de les condamner à mourir pour mon propre gain ! S'écria-t-il en refusant la main tendue de Rourke, jetant un regard rempli de colère vers Helga. - Voilà qui est bien dommage, Mr Thatch… L'entrée remarquée de Kida distrait tout le monde de Milo, qui la regarde toujours, trahi, et coupable à la fois; sans lui pour déchiffrer le Manuscrit du Berger, personne n'aurait atteint l'Atlantide – personne ne serait venu à la recherche du Cœur. - Helga ? Il l'implore du regard, s'extirpe maladroitement de l'eau et manque de trébucher; Helga ne sait pas ce qui lui prend, mais ses doigts se referment sur la crosse de son revolver qu'elle braque sur Rourke à la seconde où il commence à pointer le sien vers la princesse. - Couché, lui siffle-t-elle en retirant le cran de sécurité, son clic audible terminant de calmer tout le monde. - Sinclair, gronde Rourke en lui jetant un coup d'œil meurtrier par-dessus son épaule. - Mes excuses, Lyle, mais vous ne sauriez pas quoi en faire de toute façon, lui répondit-elle en récupérant la page manquante du Manuscrit. Libérez sa Majesté. Thatch, l'appela-t-elle à lui faisant signe d'approcher au lieu de se tenir là, tout penaud. Kida profite de la confusion pour mettre un joli crochet du droit à un des soldats qui la retenait, et le reste de l'équipage la regarde faire, l'air franchement interdit. - Vous nous avez menti, pesta Kida en s'approchant de Rourke. - Disons que j'ai omis de dire la vérité, la corrigea-t-il avec nonchalance, haussant les épaules. - Vous repartez sur-le-champ , ordonna-t-elle en les fusillant du regard. - Ah ça je n'en suis pas si sûr, Princesse… D'un coup de coude rapide, il frappe Helga à l'estomac et profite de l'avoir suffisamment sonnée pour lui faire lâcher son arme; Kida se jette sur lui dans un cri de rage, brandissant son couteau, prête à frapper – mais les soldats sont plus rapides qu'elle et l'un d'eux la saisit brutalement par le bras tandis qu'un autre pointe le canon de son arme sur sa tempe. - Tout le monde se calme maintenant ! S'écria bien fort Rourke, essuyant sa pommette ensanglantée du dos de sa main, rageur. Gentil l'aide à se relever, mais regarde tout ça d'un mauvais œil; Helga est rapidement contenue de la même façon que Kida, par Lyle qui en profite pour glisser son revolver dans la ceinture de son pantalon. - Alors comme ça, on a voulu me la faire à l'envers ? Chuchote-t-il à son oreille. - Y a pas de cristal, Lyle, gronda-t-elle en se débattant, écrasant son talon dans sa chaussure de toutes ses forces pour se libérer. Son cri de douleur est à peine satisfaisant. - Arrêtez ça, sinon on tue la princesse, n'hésita-t-il pas à la menacer. Et ça vaut aussi pour vous Mr Thatch – maintenant que vous avez la page manquante, je vous laisse le soin de la décoder, et de nous mener au trésor. Compris ? Ajouta-t-il en resserrant davantage sa prise sur les poignets déjà endoloris d'Helga. - … Compris, capitula Thatch en baissant les yeux, la page froissée dans son poing serré. Il doit se dire qu'il a encore été trop bête, trop naïf; Helga croise son regard et ne peut s'empêcher de lui faire un clin d'œil, reprit par Kida avec qui elle échange un regard entendu – à la moindre seconde d'inattention de la part des soldats, ni l'une, ni l'autre n'hésiterait. - J'imagine que sa Majesté pourra nous en dire plus, de toute façon, se félicita Rourke en faisant signe à tout le monde de le suivre jusqu'à la salle du trône. Il y a peu de soldats atlantes pour leur barrer la route – Kida est un otage précieux – et Vinny leur ouvre la porte comme la grand-mère d'Helga pelait une orange. Là, ils trouvent le vieux Roi qui semble les attendre – et résolu à ne rien leur dire. - Allons, ne faites pas cette tête, s'empresse de le consoler Rourke, toujours aussi condescendant et doucereux. Nous ne faisons que vous délester de votre bien le plus précieux, après tout… Et comme il aime se donner en spectacle, il enchaîne; le coup de poing qu'il décoche dans le ventre du père de Kida a l'air de toucher tout l'équipage qui retient son souffle, et Gentil n'hésite pas à ouvertement le critiquer. Comme si ça allait changer quelque chose… - Assez tergiversé, maugréa Rourke en se mettant à compter jusqu'à dix, son arme braquée sur le Roi. Le regard alarmé de Kida en dit plus long que le silence absolu du Roi; il préférera mourir plutôt que de révéler la position du Cœur, et dans un sens, Helga est presque soulagée – on ne peut pas voler ce qu'on n'a pas trouvé. - Dix… Oh, fait Rourke en baissant son arme. Le Cœur de l'Atlantide brille dans les yeux de son Roi, répète-t-il la phrase traduite un instant plus tôt par Milo. Sans hésiter, il jette le Roi hors de son chemin et se précipite dans le bassin, au milieu des pierres. - Est-ce qu'on a vraiment aussi peu de chance ? Se lamenta Helga à voix haute en le voyant déclencher un mécanisme caché. Et comme il ne fait confiance à personne d'autre que lui-même, il prend soin d'emmener Kida et Milo avec lui; Helga, ligotée mais pas immobilisée, saute avec eux sur la plateforme qui s'enfonce lentement sous terre. - Jackpot ! S'exclame Rourke sans détacher son regard des pierres flottantes qui entourent le fameux cristal. On dirait des masques; leurs yeux brillent du même bleu limpide que ceux de Kida, qui découvre comme eux ce que son père cachait depuis si longtemps – dans un murmure, elle s'incline, tombant à genou et se mettant à réciter une prière. - Thatch, vous lui dites d'arrêter ça, s'en plaignit immédiatement Lyle qui la surveillait du coin de l'œil. Elle ne tenterait rien – pas avec son père captif. - On a pas besoin de chants en latin pour comprendre que c'est un truc important… Lisez-nous la suite, on va pas y passer toute la journée, insista-t-il une fois Kida relevée. Rourke ne peut pas s'empêcher de s'approcher de l'eau, de lancer des petits cailloux qui viennent troubler la surface immobile du lac; le cristal se met soudain à tournoyer plus vite, comme en panique, et sa lumière devient écarlate, agressive, comme Lyle qui ne peut pas s'empêcher de reprocher ce problème à Milo. - Kida ? L'appelle Helga en voyant son collier se mettre à flotter. La lumière s'éclaircit de nouveau lorsqu'elle la touche, et semble la reconnaître; pas la peine de comprendre l'atlante pour voir que le Cœur l'appelle à lui. - Kida ! Insiste-t-elle en essayant de s'approcher. Rourke l'arrête d'un croche-pied, et empêche aussi Milo de suivre la princesse; ils la regardent s'avancer sur le lac, marcher à sa surface comme dans un rêve – lorsqu'elle se retourne, ce ne sont plus ses yeux qui les regardent, mais ceux des nombreux souverains qui ont précédé son père. - Qu'est-ce qu'elle vient de dire ? Maugréa Rourke en se tournant vers Milo, après que Kida leur ait dit quelque chose en atlante. Il fait semblant de ne pas avoir compris – Dieu ce qu'il ment mal – et Lyle gobe tout, trop heureux de voir le cristal réagir et absorber Kida en son sein, pour la recracher ensuite. - Et voilà un cristal transportable, ne plaisanta-t-il qu'à demi en la suivant hors de la cave. Le Manuscrit risque de ne plus de leur être très utile. . Comme Rourke n'a aucune confiance en elle, il la saucissonne proprement et la laisse aux pieds de Thatch, qui regarde, impuissant, l'équipage charger Kida dans un caisson puis à l'arrière du camion; incapable de retenir sa rancœur plus longtemps, il leur balance leurs quatre vérités à la figure. Helga préférerait qu'il la détache, mais apparemment ça peut attendre la fin de sa petite diatribe. - Oui, oui, et Dieu nous punira à notre mort – vous êtes un sacré rabat-joie, lui reprocha Rourke en coupant court aux reproches de Milo. - Et vous êtes un sacré salaud ! Ne put-il s'empêcher de lui cracher à la figure, tremblant de colère. - Et ça, vous l'avez bien cherché, répondit Rourke en lui mettant son poing dans la figure. Helga a même droit à un petit coup de pied. Splendide. - Tu n'iras pas bien loin comme ça, Rourke, lui promit-elle alors qu'il s'éloignait déjà. - Oh si, mais vous ne serez plus là pour le voir… Bye bye, Helga, fit-il en prenant sa place en tête de convoi. Sauf que le camion ne démarre pas – Audrey hésite. Grâce à Milo. - Entre nous Lieutenant, je vous ai toujours trouvé plus sympa que Rourke, lui souffla-t-elle comme une excuse en l'aidant à se libérer de ses liens, après avoir relevé Milo qui aurait sûrement un sacré bleu sur la joue d'ici quelques heures. - Tant pis pour le garage, alors ? Helga ne peut-elle pas s'empêcher de lui dire. - On trouvera un autre moyen, marmonna la mécanicienne sans lâcher le bras de Milo. Vinny, la Taupe et bientôt Cookie les rejoignent; Placard préfère enfumer l'habitacle et y jeter sa clope avant de descendre, se plaignant déjà du fait qu'ils allaient sans doute tous mourir. - Ouais, marmonne Rourke en les regardant dans son rétroviseur. Helga n'hésite pas à lui faire un sympathique signe de la main pour lui rappeler que c'est un connard. - Il faut qu'on fasse quelque chose – - Il a piégé le pont, Milo ! S'écrie Vinny en l'empêchant de courir bêtement après le convoi. Fous pas ta vie en l'air – En un instant, le pont vole en éclat, l'eau s'arrête de couler et les cristaux des atlantes s'éteignent; même l'air a soudain un goût de ranci, de périmé – du souffre, devine Helga en tendant sa main à Milo. - Merci – - On va la chercher, le coupa-t-elle sans le lâcher. Il hoche la tête, aussi résolu qu'elle à arrêter Rourke et à sauver l'Atlantide et sa princesse. . La seule chose à laquelle ils n'ont pas réfléchie une seule seconde en voyant le Cœur disparaître avec Rourke, c'est le Roi. - Il fait une hémorragie interne… Son corps a pas supporté le coup de Rourke. - C'est ma faute, se lamenta immédiatement Milo en entendant le pronostic du docteur. - C'est la nôtre, reprend Helga en posant la main sur son épaule. - Il voulait ce cristal depuis l'Islande, ajouta Gentil. C'était obsessionnel, Milo. C'est pas votre faute non plus, Lieutenant – vous vous êtes plus battus que nous pour l'arrêter, en tout cas… Il baisse les yeux, coupable; Helga ne voit pas quoi dire de plus, à part qu'ils perdent un temps précieux au chevet d'un vieil homme mourant à qui ils ont tout pris. - Mais le cristal, fait soudain Milo en prenant la pierre qui pend au cou du Roi entre ses doigts, il a des propriétés curatives ! Je le sais, j'ai – Le murmure fatigué du Roi l'interrompt; Kida , demande-t-il. - Où est ma fille ? Milo essaie de balbutier quelque chose, en vain – c'est pourtant assez pour que son père comprenne ce qui s'est passé. - Le cristal l'a choisie, comme sa mère avant elle, leur avoue-t-il difficilement. Quand un danger nous menace, pour se protéger… Pour nous protéger, il choisit quelqu'un de sang royal… - Choisi ? Relève Helga sans comprendre. - Vous voulez dire que ce cristal est vivant, en quelque sorte ? S'enquit Milo. - D'une certaine façon, en convint le Roi. Milo échange un regard avec Helga, mais ce n'est pas tout ce que le père de Kida a à leur dire. - Il se régénère en absorbant nos émotions, les nôtres et celles de nos ancêtres, s'expliqua-t-il plus en détails. C'est ce qui nous donne notre jeunesse, notre force… Mais c'est aussi comme ça qu'il a acquis une conscience propre – et moi, j'étais arrogant, et belliqueux… J'ai voulu en faire une arme de guerre, et j'ai poussé mon peuple à sa perte. Nous nous sommes autodétruits, par orgueil, conclut-il avec une amertume encore toute neuve, et bien vive même plus de huit millénaires après le Déluge. - Je comprends mieux pourquoi vous avez caché le cristal et empêché tout le monde d'apprendre à lire, fit Helga en massant ses poignets encore endoloris. - C'était aussi pour Kida, pour qu'elle ne subisse pas le sort de sa mère, leur avoua le Roi. Si elle devait rester prisonnière du cristal, ils fusionneraient… Et elle serait perdue pour toujours, comme ma reine bien-aimée… - On n'a pas le temps de s'ennuyer dis donc... - Il faut qu'on se dépêche, fit Milo en ignorant la réflexion d'Helga. - Je l'ai aimée de tout mon cœur, ma fille… Le Roi prend une énième inspiration douloureuse, et se redresse péniblement pour enlever le cristal à son cou et le tendre à Milo dont il attrape la main; il tend son autre bras vers elle, et sans savoir ce qui l'y pousse, Helga enlève son gant et le laisse serrer ses doigts autour des siens. - Ce fardeau est le vôtre, maintenant, souffla-t-il en cherchant leurs visages. Récupérez le cristal, et sauvez l'Atlantide. Sauvez Kida, les implora-t-il dans un dernier souffle. Gentil range son stéthoscope, et referme sa malle. . Evidemment, Milo a son petit quart d'heure de désespoir – Helga le laisse finir, et échange un regard franchement perplexe avec Gentil avant de l'encourager à se remettre sur les rails. - On t'a suivi jusqu'ici Thatch, on va pas arrêter maintenant, lui souffla-t-elle en lui tendant le Manuscrit du Berger. - Ah bah ça non ! Renchérit Gentil en souriant. Milo contemple un instant le cristal entre ses doigts, et a l'air de se décider à finalement agir. - Tu m'aideras ? Ose-t-il demander d'une petite voix à Helga. - Bien sûr, répond-t-elle immédiatement, fermant ses doigts par-dessus les siens sur le cristal. - D'accord. Rassemble le plus de guerriers atlantes que tu peux près des véhicules, là où Kida nous a emmenés, enchaîne-t-il en rajustant ses lunettes. Je te rejoins. - A tes ordres, Milo Thatch, siffla-t-elle en quittant la salle du trône au pas de course. Rassembler les atlantes, il en a des bonnes – ils parlent peut-être toutes les langues du monde, mais elle, elle n'en parle que quelques-unes et pas les plus utiles ! . Enfin de compte, les atlantes ne sont pas les plus difficiles à convaincre de filer droit. - Je prends le thon, insista Vinny en s'installant aux commandes d'un des véhicules. - En selle ! S'écria Cookie depuis ce qui ressemblait un poisson-globe, agitant sa pétoire dans tous les sens comme un bâton de majorette. - Il est content Gaëtan ! Heureusement qu'il y a une grosse récompense à la clé. . - Helga, enfin, nous avons toujours été amis – pas vrai ? - Hmm ? Milo se tient derrière elle, et braque son revolver sur Rourke qui ne tient plus à la montgolfière que par la grâce d'un index, d'un majeur, et d'un annulaire. Qui sont en train de glisser. - Vous en êtes pas capable, se moqua-t-il d'eux. - Ah, vraiment ? Vous en êtes vraiment sûr ? Fit Helga en écrasant le talon de sa botte sur ses phalanges. Milo préfère ne pas regarder. Le problème, c'est que leur petite escarmouche dans la cheminée d'un volcan pas vraiment éteint a suffi à le réveiller, et qu'il n'est pas question d'abandonner Kida; alors que les atlantes retournent vers la cité, Milo et elle se chargent d'amarrer la princesse et son cristal à l'un des plus gros véhicules, et bientôt il n'y a plus une minute à perdre : si la chaleur est un quelconque indicateur du danger qui les guette, il est plus que temps de s'en aller. - Accrochez-vous ! Leur crie Audrey en se cramponnant à la queue du poisson-globe. Malgré la lave à leur trousse, ils parviennent à atterrir au milieu de la ville sans que personne ne soit blessé; le caisson qui contient Kida est déposé au beau milieu d'une place circulaire, dégagée, tandis que le reste des vaisseaux atlantes se posent en contre-bas. - Thatch, aide-moi au lieu de me regarder, pesta Helga en essayant d'ouvrir la porte. - Essaie ça ! Lui lança-t-il en apportant une lance, qu'ils utilisent comme un pied de biche. A deux, ça va plutôt vite : le cristal termine de déboulonner le reste des parois de métal, et les fait s'envoler dans tous les sens. - Ça, c'est fait, s'en félicita Helga d'un ton satisfait. - LE MAGMA VA JAILLIR ! TROP DE PRESSION ! S'écrirait La Taupe depuis le bord de la place en agitant frénétiquement les bras dans la direction de la fissure. - Je crois qu'il dit que le volcan va exploser, fit Gentil en se tournant vers eux (et Kida). - Peut-être qu'elle peut faire quelque chose, comprit Helga en se tournant vers la princesse. Lorsque ses pieds touchèrent le sol, une grande lueur bleue en jaillit, et se mit à serpenter sur le sol, traçant des symboles aux airs atlantes; bientôt, la place se mit à trembler, jusqu'au moment où les larges masques de pierre qu'ils avaient vu dans la cave, sous la salle du trône, ne jaillissent du sol pour s'envoler avec Kida. - Elle va faire quelque chose, renchérit Milo en hochant la tête. Les stèles se mettent à tourner, tourner, si vite qu'il n'y a plus que la lumière du cristal qui brille et aucune forme discernable; des rayons d'énergie s'en échappent et filent comme des comètes, droit vers la ville, engloutie ou émergée. Et des géants de pierre se redressent soudain, animés par le cristal. Placard ne peut pas s'empêcher de prendre une petite photo souvenir des vingt, trente géants qui s'alignent tout le long du bord de la cité; quoiqu'ils fassent, l'Atlantide ne sombrera pas. Et effectivement, Helga doit avouer que le bouclier qu'ils génèrent est plutôt efficace – il n'arrête pas la lave, mais une fois l'éruption finie et le magma sec et dur, il en rompt la carapace comme si c'était la coque d'une noix. - Kida, s'entend-t-elle appeler en voyant la princesse flotter doucement jusqu'à eux. Thatch s'approche aussi, et ils la retiennent quand elle reprend ses esprits et vacille. - Helga ? Milo ? Elle les prend ses bras, et les serre, fort, tout contre elle; Helga lui rend son étreinte, soulagée de la voir finalement de retour. Tout autour d'eux, les grands lacs qui submergeaient la ville se retirent; la cité de l'Atlantide telle qu'elle était jadis réapparaît sous leurs yeux, protégée par des géants de pierre et par la magie du cristal. . - Tu vas nous manquer, Milo, lui avoua Audrey après avoir reçu son cristal de la part de Kida. Il lui sourit, mais la vérité c'est qu'il ne se voit vraiment pas rentrer. - Je veux les aider, s'explique-t-il. - C'est un peu son destin, s'en amuse Helga en haussant les épaules. - Même la fausse blonde va rester, j'y crois pas, marmonne Placard en essayant d'allumer sa cigarette avec le bout de son cristal. - C'est vrai ?! S'en excite immédiatement Kida en la prenant dans ses bras. Elle n'y a pas vraiment pensé, mais – Helga doit avouer que si la princesse continue à l'embrasser comme ça, penser va devenir tout simplement impossible. - Bon, j'crois que ce problème est réglé, ricane Milo, un peu gêné. - Ils restent avec moi ! Renchérit Kida en les prenant tous les deux par la main. Tout le monde rigole un grand coup, parce qu'au fond ça paraît évident; Kida fait charger un autre genre de véhicule atlante, amphibie cette fois, avec toutes sortes de trésors qui rendraient n'importe qui très jaloux et décidé à venir gratter le fond de l'océan. Le Léviathan les arrêtera sans doute. Et puis, sans l'aide du Manuscrit, il n'y aura que ce vieux fou de Whitmore et le reste de l'équipage pour se rappeler des coordonnées exactes; Gentil et Audrey avaient promis de se débarrasser d'un maximum de documents, avec l'aide explosive de Vinny, et la lettre que Milo lui avait écrite devrait suffire à le convaincre d'aller dans ce sens… Si le vieil homme avait autant de respect pour Thaddeus Thatch qu'il le disait, protéger son petit-fils et son héritage ne devrait pas être un problème. - Je ne pourrais jamais vous remercier assez, insista Kida en les voyant se faire leurs adieux. - T'inquiète, fit Audrey. C'est nous qui devrions te remercier… Elles échangent un sourire sincère; Placard soupire devant des conversations aussi niaises et demande à rentrer. Puisqu'ils ne vont pas crever, elle aimerait quand même rentrer et récupérer son poste d'opératrice sous-payée. Helga préfère l'amour de la princesse et la perspective de réparer erreurs, peut-être sous terre mais bien plus prêt du soleil.

Disclaimer: No tengo la imaginación, la habilidad o siquiera el dinero para hacer esta película mía (oie zy)… así que Disney y compañía fueron los encargados. (Además, se estrenó en el año que nací nwn) OoOoO One-shot \"― No es nada personal…\". La maldita caída del dirigible le estaba pasando factura. De primera sabía que algo en su espalda estaba roto y no podía sentir una de sus piernas, la otra debía estar lo suficientemente mal como para haber superado su umbral de dolor y no distinguir si dolía o no. Raspones, moretones y demás indicios de que había caído como costal contra el suelo, sólo se lo recordaban con tortuosa insistencia. También podía sentir algunas piedras incrustadas en su piel por aquí y por allá. Desde ahí podía ver los malabares que pasaban arriba. Cómo los aviones y los peces voladores de los atlantes hacían una batalla que cualquier militar en la Guerra que se suscitaba en el mundo de la superficie envidiaría. Estaba segura que peligroso, letal o no, era un espectáculo algo cruel y a la vez muy bello. Podía definir las figuras de Rourke y Milo peleando de forma demasiado dispareja a bordo del vehículo que había sido obligada a abandonar unos minutos atrás. Ese odio insano de saber que de cualquier manera ese bastardo mercenario y el niño cartógrafo no iban a salir bien librados de ese lugar hizo que la alegría y el odio le pasaran un trago con muy mal sabor. Amargo, podría jurar. De cualquier forma el gusto por ver a su homicida morir no le serviría de mucho estando en su condición. Estaba prácticamente muerta, sin contar que nadie de los de arriba parecía condolerse de su miserable apariencia. Ni los indios estúpidos, ni ese maldito negro que tenían por doctor. Nadie la ayudaría. Sintió otra punzada en el cuerpo, como si él mismo le recriminara sus pensamientos hacia los demás. Se abstuvo de llamarlo bastardo a él también por el tremendo sufrimiento que se encargaba de repartirle. Para esas alturas del juego, se sentía hueca y vacía de empatía para pretender fingir ser amable, a final de cuentas, estando postrada en esa incómoda piedra, ya todo le podía bien dar igual. Y encima no tenía caso auto justificar sus actos. Sólo tras un vistazo y de darse cuenta que el debilucho colgaba bajo la hélice del dirigible, huyendo de una luz azul muy extraña; fue que por un segundo sintió un atisbo de lástima por Milo y la chica que trataba de defender de forma tan deficiente. Vaya que el enclenque era necio para irse a meter en la cueva del lobo a pelear con alguien que de cualquier forma le ganaba. Era necio y tan idiota que no valoraba su vida. Ese muchacho ciertamente debía amar su trabajo y a la princesa para arriesgarse de esa forma. Un resplandor proveniente de esa hélice, que sus ojos miraban totalmente perdidos entre el delirio de las heridas y el ensimismamiento de pasar así sus últimos momentos, hizo que reaccionara de forma un tanto brusca para mirar cómo el chico, la caja y todo el dirigible caían a pocos metros de su sitio. Bueno, no es como si ese cráter fuese tan grande, pensó con ironía. Incluso la vida conspiraba para no matarla ahí mismo. No escuchaba las voces de los victoriosos pero estaba consciente que ellos habían ganado. El que lidiasen bien con ese enfrentamiento tan disparejo sonaba tan irreal, y el hecho de haber ganado, más. Siguió mirando hasta que sintió el temblor del suelo. Recordó de golpe las palabras de Moliére… Una grieta abrió justo a su lado dejando salir sus vapores y algo de lava. Vio al resto del grupo alejarse volando a toda marcha y entonces una triste y dolorosa, como casi todo en ella, sonrisa se formó por un momento. Cerrando los ojos, esperó su final, pues nada más le quedaba. OoOoO Retomo: Cookie al final dice: ― ¡Murió cuando un dirigible en llamas le cayó encima! Seguido de un sombrillazo… pero si Helga hubiese estado ahí cuando se cayó el dirigible, Milo y Kida la habrían matado primero por caerle encima, o igualmente se habría salvado, lo cual habría dejado una escena de descuartizamiento muy cruel con una caja y una chica traslúcida dentro… Por lo tanto ella sí que muere pero porque se horneó en un volcán… Maldito Disney sádico… Segundo dato: La película se desarrolla en el año de 1914… sí, desconozco el mes, pero en ese año inicia la Primera Guerra Mundial, así que quise incluirla. Tercer dato (sin importancia), no, no soy fan de Star Wars... ah, eso no iba... En realidad, sospecho que este es el primer fic en español de esta película ¡Qué emoción!

Summary : AU. Milo Thatch is an Atlantean scholar named Mayloth'tash, and he's finally found the fabled \"surface\"…sort of. He's a little too injured, disoriented, and in awe of the foot soldiers looming over him to realize it just yet. Notes : This is another little exercise in reinterpretation: how would Milo and Kida's first meeting look if Milo were Atlantean and Kida were American? Everyone in the story has been \"heritage-swapped\" and the plot adjusted accordingly. This kicks off right when Milo's expedition realizes he's gone after the bridge burns. Language Notes : Adding the suffix \"top\" (rhymes with \"nope\") to a name in Atlantean denotes a friend. Also, their names are spelled now using actual movie-verse Atlantean phonetics, not just the author's whims. \"What do you think, Mayloth'tash?\" No answer. Helga looked around, the blue tattoos on her right cheek and across her nose seeming to glow in the light. \"Mayloth'tash?\" \"Maylo-top!\" Adri called, swinging her lantern around wildly. \"Maylo-top?\" \"Look!\" Mol leapt to his feet, holding aloft a glowing blue crystal pendant. A quick look around confirmed that everyone else already wore theirs; it was an extra. \"It has to be Maylo's,\" Adri declared, snatching the precious gem from Mol's dirty fingers. \"But if Maylo's crystal is here…\" Jashwa trailed off uncertainly, dark eyes scanning the surrounding forest. Helga had no such qualms about speaking everyone's thoughts out loud. \"If this is his crystal, then where is he. \" { { } \" That's unnatural, that is.\" \" Where did he come from?\" \" Maybe he's Indian?\" \" No, look at his hair.\" \" He doesn't look old enough for hair that white…\" \" What do we do with him?\" The voices were strange—though Maylo could understand the meaning behind the words, the words themselves sounded so very foreign. Curiosity gripped him, and he struggled to wake, to face the owners of these strange tongues. When he opened his eyes, however, he found himself staring right into impossibly dark eyes, inches from his own. Maylo gasped and flinched back, eyes flickering frantically about himself, trying to take everything in. He appeared to still be in the dark forest, but he was surrounded by unfamiliar creatures… Were they humans? They were bipedal, five-fingered organisms like himself, but their faces were shrouded in shadows cast by helmets, and all he could see of them were very pale chins. He had never seen any human with skin lighter than his own. Not only that, but their style of clothing was peculiar. Thick, coarse, and covering everything from their chins to their fingertips to their toes…aside from their pale jaws, he couldn't see any skin whatsoever. Was that on purpose, to cover tattoos by which they could be identified? Or was it an armor of some sort? Shiny black things were attached to their hips, and though he did not recognize the objects themselves, he had been travelling with soldiers long enough to recognize the way in which the creatures sported them and gripped them—they were weapons. \"Who are you?!\" Maylo asked, his voice hoarse. The reaction was instantaneous. Every one of the strangers, even the one looming over him, jerked back as if stung, letting out sudden, deafening shouts of shock. Maylo released his own startled yelp and jerked back, colliding with the boulder he had previously been slumped against—only for a sharp pain to shoot through his arm and back. He doubled over with a grunt, clutching his shoulder and wincing to feel hot, thick liquid coat his fingers. Great night, he'd been injured. With his free hand, he fumbled for his crystal…only for his blunt fingers to meet merely bare skin. His crystal was gone . Why hadn't he realized it sooner?! Now that he knew that it was gone, the absence of the soothing, illuminating blue glow that he was so used to seemed as plain as day. His breaths began to speed up, and his hand clenched into a shaking, white-knuckled fist. He trembled. \" Are you okay? \" The feeling of coarse fingertips on his arm made him start violently, flinching away despite the pain, and his eyes flew from his wound to the face of his attacker. What was it going to do? Kill him? Bind him? Eat him? He knew nothing about the fauna of this new world… Then, the thing reached up and removed the strange helmet from its head…and Maylo was blown away. She was…so strange. He had never seen skin so pale, nor eyes so dark, nor hair that color, almost like gold, but warmer and darker. He had no idea what the spirits had been thinking when they painted her—had they purposefully mixed up their brushes to turn her skin pale and her hair dark? The resulting effect both terrified and fascinated him, and he found himself unable to twitch even a muscle as he stared at her, trying to decide between his curiosity and his fear. His wound was almost forgotten, as blood dripped, unnoticed, down his palm. Her eyes met his for only a moment before she looked down, digging around in some kind of square pack. The objects she produced—white cloth and a bottle of clear liquid—did not look dangerous, but when she removed the cap from the bottle, the smell it released put Maylo on edge. Though he did not recognize it, he found himself instinctively shying away. Her grip on his arm tightened. \" Hold still.\" That strange language again—that he did and didn't recognize. Now that he was fully conscious, he realized that he had heard it before. Somewhere…but…where? All thought was driven from his mind in the next instant, as the woman wet the clean cloth and pressed it firmly to his wound. He sucked in a startled breath and flinched back, only to find the boulder once again in his way. He let out a hiss of displeasure. \" Stop struggling .\" \"What is that?!\" he demanded, fingers curling into fists. \" Yes, I know it hurts, but it'll only hurt for a second; I promise.\" \"What? That's not what I—\" She interrupted him with more soothing words, sweet nothings that, as her care of his wound continued, he eventually realized were akin to what one would say while tending an injured animal—a dumb one who couldn't understand what you were saying—to keep it from running away. He figured out that she couldn't understand him and so assumed that he couldn't understand her, as well. So he quieted, and he listened, determined to learn how to speak their language. He knew that it was familiar somehow… He just had to figure out where he had heard it before.

Rencana di Balik Jendela oleh reycchi untuk Challenge Yourself Challenge (Paket Spesial) dan #JumblingJuly2017 (Benda Berkesan) . . . Kala itu, Lyle Tiberius Rourke bersama Thaddeus Thatch tengah berada di kediaman Preston Whitmore, mendiskusikan Jurnal Shepherd yang berhasil mereka temukan di Islandia beberapa hari lalu. Kedua orang tua itu, Thatch dan Whitmore, asyik membincangkan segala macam hal yang gagal Rourke pahami. Walau begitu, sang pria berbadan raksasa bisa maklum. Keduanya memang sudah menjadi sahabat baik sejak dulu, jadi wajar saja jika mereka abai terhadap eksistensi Rourke. \"Thaddeus, Tuan Whitmore.\" Rourke mengucap sambil perlahan bangkit dari duduknya yang mulai terasa tidak nyaman akibat eksistensi tak teracuhkan. \"Saya akan keluar untuk merokok selama beberapa menit.\" \"Oh, silakan, Rourke, silakan!\" Whitmore menjawab dengan wajah girang. \"Helga akan mengantarkan minumanmu keluar.\" Rourke menyunggingkan senyum tipis sebelum beranjak bangun. Dilangkahkannya kaki menuju pintu balkon, hendak keluar dari atmosfer teman lama yang telah ia rasakan sejak tiba di rumah ini. Bukannya dia melarang mereka untuk membahas masa lalu atau bagaimana, Rourke hanya tidak suka diabaikan. Ia dan Thatch datang untuk membahas kelanjutan ekspedisi setelah penemuan Jurnal Shepherd, dan sekarang dirinya malah disuguhi kisah aku-cium-kau-jika-kau-berhasil-menemukan-jurnal-itu. Sebatang rokok dikeluarkan pemimpin ekspedisi Atlantis itu dari saku bajunya. Ia rogoh saku celananya, mencari korek. Dinyalakannya korek itu, dibiarkannya rokok terbakar perlahan. Barulah setelahnya, ia mengisap batang putih tersebut. Posisi Rourke tidak jauh dari pintu balkon jadi obrolan antara Thatch dan Whitmore masih dapat ia dengar meski samar. \"Sialan kau, Thatch, kau berhasil mendapatkannya!\" \"Aku tahu, Whitmore, bahkan untuk merayakan keberhasilanku itu, aku langsung menamatkannya—dua belas jam setelah perjalanan selesai!\" \"Kau gila!\" \"Tidak, dan aku menemukan hal yang selama ini aku cari-cari.\" \"Oh ya? Tentang apa?\" \"Tentang semacam 'kristal' raksasa yang menjadi—\" Apa? Kristal? Rourke menajamkan pendengarannya. Kristal kedengaran menarik—dan mahal. Rourke tahu dirinya penjelajah, petualang, tetapi uang tetap menjadi minat nomor satunya. Jadi, tidak, dia tidak akan melewatkan kesempatan emas untuk tidak mencari Atlantis jika kristal super mahal menjadi jaminannya. \"—yang kaubicarakan, Thatch. Sumber kehidupan bagaimana?\" \"Kristal itu besar dan melayang di atas tanah, Whitmore! Dia yang membuat seluruh Atlantis tetap hidup hingga saat ini!\" \"Kau bercanda, Thatch, Atlantis hancur sejak ribuan tahun lalu, mustahil masih ada kehidupan di sana.\" \"Kristal ini membuatnya mungkin, Whitmore.\" Rourke melirik melalui jendela dan melihat Thatch menunjuk sebuah halaman dengan gambar kristal biru di bagian tengahnya. \"Bahkan Shepherd menjelaskannya di sini. Kristal ini menjaga seluruh Atlantis tetap hidup, karena itulah aku bilang kristal ini adalah sumber kehidupan mereka.\" \"Wow, pasti harganya sangat mahal kalau dijual.\" \"Amat sangat mahal. Rasanya tidak sebanding menghancurkan sebuah peradaban demi uang.\" \"Apa maksudmu, Thatch?\" \"Jika kristal itu dibawa pergi, maka Atlantis akan—\" Klik . Rourke buru-buru menyingkir dari jendela. Pintu balkon terbuka dan keluarlah seorang gadis pirang bergaun hitam dengan nampan berisi segelas wine di tangan. Rourke langsung mengetahuinya sebagai Helga, nama gadis yang disebut-sebut Whitmore tadi. \"Minumanmu, Tuan,\" ucap gadis pirang itu sambil meletakkan gelas tadi di atas sebuah meja dekat pintu. \"Sebentar lagi waktu makan siang, Tuan, dan Tuan Whitmore juga mengundang Anda untuk ikut makan. Anda diharapkan hadir di ruang makan lima belas menit lagi.\" \"Katakan, Helga,\" ujar Rourke sebelum gadis pirang itu sempat menutup pintu balkon. \"Apa kau mau jadi kaya?\" Helga tersenyum sinis. \"Semua orang ingin jadi kaya, Tuan, begitu pula aku.\" \"Apa kau ingin bergabung dalam sebuah ekspedisi pencarian kristal raksasa dengan harga selangit?\" \"Apa? Ekspedisi penc—\" \"Pikirkan, kita, aku dan kau, bisa jadi kaya dalam sekejap,\" potong Rourke sambil menunjuk dirinya dan Helga bergantian. \"Kau tidak perlu lagi bekerja untuk Preston Whitmore, bahkan kau bisa membuat rumah besar untukmu sendiri. Kau hanya harus sedikit berkorban nyawa, tapi aku yakin kita bisa selamat.\" Helga mengangkat alisnya. \"Apa yang sebenarnya kaubicarakan?\" \"Atlantis. Kita ambil kristal mereka, jual, dan kita jadi kaya.\" \"Apa Tuan Whitmore tahu tentang ini?\" \"Tidak, baru kau dan aku. Whitmore pasti mengirimmu untuk ikut ekspedisi ini nanti, bukan? Aku hanya perlu membujuk Thatch, lalu selanjutnya mudah.\" \"Baiklah, aku ikut,\" putus Helga cepat. \"Tapi pastikan kau benar-benar mendapatkan kristal itu.\" \"Kau bisa mengandalkanku.\" Rourke menjulurkan tangannya, hendak bersalaman. \"Jadi kita saling sepakat, Rekan?\" Helga membalas uluran tangan itu. \"Sepakat, Tuan ...?\" \"Rourke, dan tidak perlu memanggilku Tuan.\" \"Sepakat, Rourke.\" Kala itu, Helga tidak tahu perjanjian tidak tertulis yang mereka buat berbuah keburukan di akhir. . Helga sudah masuk kembali ke dalam rumah, hendak mengurus ini-itu terkait makan siang, katanya. Thatch dan Whitmore masih terlibat dalam obrolan seru yang Rourke gagal pahami, tapi rokoknya sudah habis sehingga mau tidak mau, Rourke harus bergabung kembali di dalam atmosfer tidak menyenangkan baginya itu. \"Ah, Rourke, sudah selesai?\" sapa Whitmore sambil bangkit dari duduknya. \"Sudah waktunya makan siang, aku dan Thatch akan pergi ke ruang makan duluan. Kau masih ...?\" \"Oh, ya, Tuan Whitmore, aku masih akan di sini sebentar lagi,\" balas Rourke sambil memasang senyum sopan. \"Mulutku masih rasa tembakau, kurasa aku akan menunggu sebentar lagi.\" \"Kalau begitu kami duluan.\" Thatch bangkit dari duduknya. \"Rourke.\" Rourke mengangguk. \"Ya, Thatch.\" Lalu sepasang sejoli—eh, sahabat—tua itu pergi meninggalkan ruang pertemuan. Rourke melirik meja pertemuan dan menemukan Jurnal Shepherd di sana. Dibukanya jurnal itu, dicarinya halaman dengan gambar kristal biru raksasa yang tadi ia lihat ditunjuk oleh Thatch. Ia berhasil menemukan halaman itu. Buru-buru Rourke menyobeknya sebelum bergegas menyusul sepasang sahabat tua tadi menuju ruang makan. Tunggu aku, Kristal Atlantis . . . .

Why was I doing that? Because A. it's my all-time favorite Disney movie, and B. I was bored and thought it would be fun to do, since the actual Cinemasins never did it. Anyway, as the description says, this is my idea of what would've happened if the Atlanteans . hadn't been scared off by the digger after healing Milo, and also if Milo's injuries had been more realistic to his situation. Rating is for blood and description of injury. I don't think it's that bad, but better safe than sorry. Also, very little swearing. I don't own Atlantis: The Lost Empire . Believe me, you'd know if I did. I would- Audrey: Yeah yeah, disclaimer, we know, shut up (tries to punch me) Two for flinching. (punches me twice) They approached slowly, cautiously. At first, they thought the outsider had died in the fall from above that separated him from the others. But as they approached, they could see his chest rise and fall. He wasn't dead, just unconscious. But he was injured, they could see that. His clothes were strange, but the blood on them was easy to recognize. And as Kida drew nearer, she could see a slight jerk in the rise and fall of his chest, indicating labored breaths masked only by his unconsciousness. One of his legs was bent at an odd angle, and there was a dark stain on the ground beneath it. She edged the tip of her spear under the bottom of his shirt and carefully lifted it. She gasped when she saw the size and severity of the bruises there, and she could only imagine the wounds beneath them. She looked up to his face and saw a few scratches there, and cracks in the strange glass circles on his face. She recognized him, though. She'd been watching him in particular ever since her hunting party had first spotted the outsiders coming. He'd caught her attention because he seemed so out of place. The rest of the male outsiders were at least decently sized and muscled, if not the huge burly sort like the dark skinned bald man or the pale skinned man who seemed to be the leader. But this man was small and thin, almost frail compared to even the women of the group. Where the others had a sort of military determination to press forward, this one had always been staring around, eyes wide with wonder as he would start talking about how old something was or how long it took to carve it. The others always brushed him aside or ignored him when this happened, and when they would stop to eat or sleep, the little one was always left alone. The Little One. That was what she'd decided to call him, for that's what he seemed like. In body yes, but also in how he looked and acted. Whenever he would start talking about how old something was, his eyes would light up like shards of crystal, like a child seeing the world outside their house for the first time. Only to have that light snuffed out by the others, at which point he would adopt a weary, sad look that would last until he saw something else that amazed him. A soft groan brought her back to the present. The Little One stirred weakly, and her companions jerked back in alarm. \"Kida! We should go now!\" one warrior said, \"Just leave the outsider.\" \"We cannot just leave him, he is hurt!\" she answered. \"You know our laws would not permit it!\" the other warrior said \"Yes, Galim, I know our laws.\" Kida said sharply as she turned back to The Little One, whose eyelids fluttered, \"But I also know what is right. The others do not know he is here. and he is too hurt to go looking for them. He will die if we leave him here like this.\" \"He will die by our laws anyway.\" said the first warrior. \"Mekesh, I could not live with myself if I killed a helpless, injured person or just left them to die when I knew I could help them. It would be wrong, it would be against everything our people believe. Please understand.\" Kida looked at them, and though she couldn't see their faces through their masks, she knew them well enough to know she had won. \"All right, Kida.\" Galim said, \"We will take him back to the city.\" \"He is awake!\" Mekesh exclaimed. Kida looked and sure enough, The Little One was awake, his soft brown eyes wide with fear. He tried to move back from them, but the moment he did, the color drained from his face and he sucked in hard to contain the cry of agony that threatened to leave him. Galim and Mekesh moved to either side of him as she approached him, speaking softly, gently, in an effort to soothe him. \"Do not worry, Little One. We are here to help. Lay still, we will not hurt you.\" She gently lifted him off the ground with Galim's help, Mekesh supporting his injured leg. They moved quickly and silently, except for The Little One's soft sounds of pain. Kida responded to these, whispering softly to him, assuring him he was going to be all right. All three warriors noticed the red drips on the ground marking their path, but there was nothing they could do. As they exited the caves, The Little One fell limp in their arms, unconscious again. Voices were the first thing Milo heard, and he wondered what had happened after the fall. But the voices weren't those of the others in the group. They spoke a strange language, though he thought maybe he recognized it. He groaned softly as some feeling returned to him, mostly a soreness throughout his whole body. He blinked a few times to clear his vision, noticing his glasses had cracked, and saw the creatures, whatever they were, standing over him, one of them holding up his shirt with a spear. He gasped and went to scramble back away from them. But the moment he did, his entire body erupted in pain, and it was all he could do not to scream. The creatures came closer, one of them, a female by the sound of her voice, speaking softly in the strange language. He realized she was speaking to him as she came to his side and he felt himself being lifted off the ground by two sets of arms, a third taking his legs. He winced as a burst of pain lanced through him every time he was moved. The female continued to speak softly to him as they carried him to who-knew-where. Weak from loss of blood, Milo slipped into unconsciousness again. When he woke next, he was someplace warm. His whole body ached, and when he opened his eyes, everything was blurry. He blinked a few times to try to clear his sight before he realized he didn't have his glasses on. Great, Milo thought, I must have lost them when those...whatever they were brought me to...wherever I am. He tried to sit up and instantly cried out in pain, even as he felt a pair of soft hands gently easing him back down. \"Lay still.\" came a woman's soft but stern voice, and Milo recognized it as the woman who had spoken to him in the caves. \"You are badly injured, Little One.\" she added. \"H-How-\" he gasped out. \"Your companions are with my father now.\" she said, \"We have not yet told them you are here, as they have just arrived and we were busy with your injuries.\" As if on cue, Milo felt another stab of pain, and the blur he guessed was the woman came closer and lowered itself beside him. He felt a hand brush back his hair with a soft touch. \"I know it hurts,\" the woman said softly, \"but the healers say you will be all right, Here, I will help with the pain for now.\" The blur moved and suddenly the pain from his leg dulled, followed by the pain from his chest. \"Thank you.\" he said weakly. She noticed how his eyes seemed to drift around, not focusing on anything in particular. \"Are you blind?\" she asked, concerned. \"No, I just-...I need my glasses. I can't see without my glasses.\" he said slowly. \"What are glasses?\" she asked. \"Pieces of glass. I was wearing them when we fell-\" \"Ah, you mean the flat crystals you had on your face.\" Milo nodded, \"They were cracked. Broken. Our craftsmen are repairing them.\" Kida smiled, knowing he probably couldn't see it. Now that he was in the light and cleaned up, he was even more different from the others, whom Kida had seen in her father's throne room. His features were softer, his skin fairer, his limbs longer. But the biggest difference she saw were his eyes. Unlike the the others, The Little One had large, soft, warm eyes that shone with childlike innocence and genuine kindness. He was the complete opposite of the others. \"Who are you, Little One?\" she wondered aloud. He must've heard her, because he answered. \"M-Me? Oh, uh, my name's Milo.\" \"Milo.\" Kida repeated. It was a strange word, but it fit him perfectly. At least she thought so. It sounded so...small and innocent. Just like him. \"I am Kidagakash. You may call me Kida if that is easier for you.\" Milo nodded slowly. \"Kida. I can remember that.\" \"And you are Milo. I can remember that.\" she said, earning a tiny smile from Milo. She moved a stray piece of his soft brown hair out of his eyes just as the healer, Keshet, returned. She frowned when she saw that Milo was awake. \"He's not going to like this, Kida.\" she warned, \"He's broken some ribs in addition to that leg. I still have to set all of those, and it WILL be painful. VERY painful.\" \"I found him, I will stay with him.\" Kida said. Keshet nodded as Kida sat back down beside Milo, laying his head in her lap. As if he had understood their rapid Atlantean, Milo's entire body was trembling, his eyes wide again. He was scared. She couldn't blame him, really. He was defenseless and at their mercy, he was badly injured, and he couldn't see what they were doing to him. The shakiness in his voice confirmed his fear. \"Kida? Kida, what's happening? Where are you?\" \"Shh, Milo, I am here.\" she said, stroking his forehead gently. \"You are going to be all right.\" \"What about that woman? She said 'it will be painful.' What is she going to do to me?\" He shook harder as he looked at her. \"You have broken your leg and some ribs, Milo. She is going to-\" Kida cut off as she suddenly realized what had just happened. Milo had repeated, in his own language, Keshet's exact words! But how? A look from Keshet told her she hadn't imagined it. Which left only one explanation. Milo could understand Atlantean. \"You know our language?\" Kida said, surprised. \"Yes.\" Milo answered, \"Yes, I can read and speak Atlante-AAAAAAAGH!\" Milo screamed as Keshet started on his leg, and Kida was surprised by how loud the sound was. She hated the sound, along with the sickening sound of his bones being moved back into place. Milo's cries only got worse as Keshet continued, tears springing to his eyes faster than Kida could dry them. It was a horrible, inhuman sound, the most awful thing she'd ever heard, even as he begged for the pain to end. After what seemed like forever, his leg was straightened and Keshet was immobilizing and bandaging it. Kida slowly lifted a sobbing Milo into a sitting position against her side as she held up a cup of water to let him drink. He did so in between sobs, his hair matted with tears and sweat. \"I'm afraid the worst part is next.\" Keshet said gravely, \"and as much as I would like to let the poor thing rest after that ordeal, I cannot. His bones would start to heal incorrectly, and then I would have re-break them before I set them, and that would be even worse for him.\" Kida nodded as Milo finished his drink. She carefully laid him back down and took his hand in hers, nodding to Keshet that he was ready. If Kida thought his screams of agony were horrible before, they were nothing compared to the gut wrenching sounds that tore out of him now. If Death itself were a sound, she was certain it would be this sound. Fresh rivers of tears poured from Milo's eyes. Only her hold on his hand stopped her from running from the awful, heartbreaking sound sound. If this was her reaction just to hearing it, she couldn't even imagine what it was like to be Milo and FEEL it. The only warning Milo had received had been the woman saying \"it will be painful\" in Atlantean. But even her added \"VERY painful\" didn't prepare him for what was coming. The pain assaulted him, forcing the screams out of him. His leg felt like it was stuck in a furnace. He couldn't stop the tears that flowed from his eyes, making his already blurry vision even worse. He focused all his attention on the soft hands he knew to be Kida that he felt trying to dry his tears. When at long last it was over, Kida had helped him sit up to take a drink. The cold water rushed into him, seeming to dull the burn of his pain. That is, until he was laid back down and he felt Kida take his hand in hers. Then he felt a whole new kind of pain that threatened to rip him apart. The soft, soothing voice of Kida was drowned out by Milo's shrieks as the pain only got worse, ripping into every part of him, threatening to destroy him. When it was finally over, he had just enough time to realize that it was over before darkness took him. Kida felt Milo go limp against her just seconds after Keshet said she was finished putting the bones back in place and started setting and bandaging his chest. Kida carefully dried the remaining tears and sweat off his face. \"it's over now.\" the old healer assured her, \"The worst is over.\" \"That was the most horrid thing I've ever heard.\" Kida said. \"He'll be alright now. And now we can use the crystals to move things along some.\" Together, Keshet and Kida repeatedly used their crystals on Milo's set bones, doing as much as they could before he woke. Milo was still in the same place when he woke, but the pain was almost gone, now a dull ache. He still couldn't see, but he could feel someone gently cleaning his face with a wet cloth. He groaned quietly. \"Kida?\" he asked. \"Yes, Milo.\" she answered, \"Don't worry, the worst part is over. You won't have to go through that again.\" \"Thank you, again.\" he said, \"For saving my life, I mean.\" She nodded, then remembered the craftsman that had come by while Milo was unconscious. \"Here.\" she said as she carefully unfolded the strange things and gently placed them on Milo's face the way she had seen them on him before. Instantly, his eyes lit up. \"My glasses!\" he exclaimed, \"You fixed them!\" \"We thought they were of sentimental value to you, but then you told me you cannot see without them, so I sent a message to the glass crafter and the metal smith that were working on them that they were needed quickly.\" With the glasses on now, his eyes focused and didn't roll around in all directions. They stayed trained on her as she spoke. The lenses actually made his eyes look a bit larger, and she found he looked even better with them on. \"The others will be here to see him soon.\" Keshet said, \"If he feels up to it, of course.\" \"Yes,\" Milo nodded, \"Now that I can actually see them.\" They had searched around the cave once they realized Milo was missing, each person (except probably Rourke) Wondering what had happened to him. It was Audrey who had first come upon the rock with the dark stains on and around it. She gasped at the size of the stain on the ground. She only hoped the linguist was okay. Yes, he was frustrating and weird and always seemed to be in the way, but that didn't meant she wanted to see him hurt or worse. She swallowed hard when she realized the stains were blood. \"You guys better get down here!\" she yelled back. She then noticed the barefoot tracks of three different sizes all over the ash on the ground. There were smaller drips leading away from the big bloodstains, along with three sets of footprints, but none of them were Milo's boots, so whoever the tracks belonged to must've carried Milo off. Audrey heard the others coming behind her. \"This way!\" she called as she started following the trail of blood drops, \"And fast! It looks like he's hurt!\" She could've sworn she heard Rourke groan under his breath, but at that moment she just wanted to find Milo and be sure he was all right. Audrey's hands flew to her mouth when they were led to the healer's area and she saw a pair of pants and a bloody shirt thrown on a table that had to be Milo's. Only he was that small. She saw his boots on the floor, one of them cut open down the side with bloodstains around the top and the sock still inside it. \"Dios mio!\" she said, and her hand went to Milo's bag, which hung over her shoulder. She looked inside and for once was glad he was so weird, for he'd put an extra set of clothes in the bag. All he'd need were new boots. She followed the others into another room and that's where she finally breathed a sigh of relief. Milo was alive, and it seemed the Atlanteans had already been caring for him, as they'd cleaned all the dirt and blood off him. His hair was still matted against his head, and she could tell he'd been crying from something. Then she noticed his chest and right leg wrapped in white bandaging, two pillows supporting his leg and a blanket draped over him. \"Hey guys.\" he said. Audrey was about to make some snarky comment at him, but stopped when she heard the weariness in his voice. Clearly, he'd been in a lot of pain, if he wasn't still. Snark was probably the last thing he needed. \"Milo, what happened?\" she asked, \"We thought you died.\" \"I felt like I was dying when they set my ribs.\" Milo said as Sweet knelt beside the low bed Milo was on and started to examine him. \"No sign of infection or inflamation, internal or otherwise.\" Sweet announced, \"Major bruising around the fracture sites, but that's to be expected. No sign of any other injury, major or minor. Looks-\" \"Sweet, the rest of him's already hurt, don't give him a headache too.\" Vinny said. \"But this is weird.\" the doctor said, \"These breaks look like he's been recovering from them for weeks. And those cuts through his shirt? Nowhere to be found.\" \"Ah, that would be our doing.\" Keshet said, \"Watch.\" They did as she lifted on corner of the blanket, exposing Milo's arm and a cut across the top of it. She quickly healed the wound with her crystal, the cut gone when she removed her hand, as if it was never there. \"Of course, broken bones take a lot more of that if you need them to heal quickly. It helps with pain, too.\" \"So, he'll be okay.\" Audrey said. Keshet nodded. \"He can go now if he feels like it. Just take it easy on that leg and those ribs.\" \"I have a spare set of clothes in my bag.\" Milo said, \"Except shoes.\" \"I still got my standard issues I never wore.\" Vinny said, \"Those would probably fit you. Lemme go get 'em\" And with that the explosives expert ran out of the room. \"Here you go.\" Audrey said, pulling out Milo's spare clothes. \"Really? You even brought an extra BELT?\" \"Hey, you laughed at me for packing the clothes, and look what happened.\" Milo shot back as Sweet helped him remove his splints and slip his pants on. \"...okay, you got me there.\" the mechanic said as she helped him into his shirt, just as Vinny brought in his spare shoes, which Milo pulled on under Sweet's watchful eye. Finally, he took his bag back from Audrey. \"Thanks.\" he said. \"Just do us a favor, Milo.\" Vinny remarked. \"What?\" the linguist asked. Audrey glared as she took his arm and led him out of the building. \"Don't almost die again.\" ","Summary":" This idea came to me while writing a Cinemasins (an awesome YouTube channel, check it out if you ha"},{"Movie":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","Title":"Safe and Sound","Author":"SentinelSpockNimoy","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12746084","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I don't own Atlantis. This is partly inspired by the song \"Safe and Sound\" by Taylor Swift. I wrote this when I was feeling like crap so sorry if it's a little depressing. No mean comments please, this is written to help me feel better. This is AU, where Helga is the villainous mastermind behind stealing the crystal and Rourke is a better person than he was in the movie. You'll be all right No one can hurt you now \"Move out!\" And with that, Helga's two trucks started off across the bridge, the rest of the crew too stunned to do anything but watch. Only when they reached the other side did Milo snap out of it and run after them, Vinny yanking him back mere seconds before Helga detonated the bombs. A disheartened Milo stared helplessly after them, tears forming in his eyes. \"I'm such an idiot.\" he whispered softly, \"I'm sorry, Kida.\" He didn't even flinch when a large hand came to rest on his shoulder. \"It's not your fault, Thatch.\" Milo finally looked up to see the owner of the hand. Commander Rourke. \"We all got duped, myself included. She was using us the whole time, Milo. There's no way you could've known that.\" The look on the linguist's face was heartbreaking, even for the war veteran. He turned to the rest of the team. \"Go check on Sweet and everyone at the palace.\" His order was stern and solemn as he put an arm around Milo. \"Come on. Walk with me.\" Milo nodded and let Rourke guide him away from the bridge, the Atlanteans parting to let them through. They came to a stop in a secluded area beside a pool where fireflies danced on and above the surface. Rourke took a seat on a large stone slab, gently pulling Milo down beside him. Almost immediately, Milo leaned against the larger man's side, his eyes still watering. Rourke carefully dried his tears, taking the young man's glasses and cleaning them with his shirt before handing them back to him. \"I should've seen through her, Milo.\" he said, \"It was my job to keep everyone on this trip safe and to recognize threats. It's what I was trained to do.\" \"But I'm the one that led her here.\" Milo said. \"Unknowingly.\" Rourke added, \"Based on your line of work, you've probably never been tricked or used by somebody to achieve their own ends.\" \"Except when they rejected my proposals.\" \"Well now you know they were wrong, Milo.\" Rourke stated. \"Fat lot of good that does me now.\" Milo shook his head, \"I wouldn't have told them anyway, to protect the Atlanteans. I just didn't expect one of us to be the one to kill them.\" He shook with that statement, \"Atlantis is going to die and it's all my fault. Jeez, I'm so STUPID!\" Milo slammed his fist into his hand, his tears finally coming out. Rourke couldn't take this and pulled the linguist close so his face was buried in Rourke's shoulder as sobs racked his small body. \"You're not stupid, Milo, you're anything BUT stupid. You're just like your grandfather, seeing only the best in people. Which makes you easy to take advantage of, yes, but it doesn't make you stupid.\" \"What do I do, Rourke? I wasn't prepared to do this, to deal with a traitor. I don't know what to do now.\" Milo stared at his feet again while Rourke thought for a moment. There was only one piece of advice he knew to give. It was from the military, but it just might work. \"Fight them.\" Rourke said, \"It's the last thing a traitor like her would expect from somebody like you. When she left, you looked completely defeated. Broken. No longer a threat. That's her weakness right now, Milo. You can use her own strategy against her.\" \"What strategy? What do you mean, Rourke?\" \"I mean looking like you're not a threat. That's what she did the whole way here, so we never recognized the threat. Well now she doesn't recognize the threat you pose.\" \"I don't pose a threat to anyone except maybe a fly. I'm weak. Pathetic. I-\" Rourke cut him off. \"On the contrary, you are more dangerous to her than me. You're intelligent, analytical. You think fast, which can mean life or death in a crisis. Ever battle I've ever seen was won because of someone like you knowing when, where, and how to use grunts like me. She may have the firepower, Milo, but she doesn't have the intelligence needed to use it right. And, you know more about this place than anyone. There's gotta be more than one way out of here. How did they build that bridge in the first place, flying?\" Milo's eyes suddenly lit up as if he was remembering something. \"Flying...Rourke, you're a genius! Come on, let's go get the others.\" Rourke easily kept up with the scholar, despite his confusion as to what Milo was talking about. He figured Milo wound explain it once they found the others. Don't you dare look out your window Darlin' everything's on fire The war outside our door keeps ragin' on Flying actually WAS Milo's plan. He instructed everyone on how to operate the Atlantean stone fish vehicles, called Ketaks and Martags. The former were the large ones with glowing eyes, the latter were long and narrow. Witnessing the king's death seemed to have reignited the ember of Milo's spirit, and being charged with saving Atlantis had turned it into an inferno. His brown eyes blazed as he yelled out his rallying cry as the entire armada rose into the air, Rourke's Ketak gliding alongside Milo's Martag as they shot toward the cave that led to the volcano's base. The first sign of their enemy that they saw was the enormous Gyro-evac already rising into the air with the crystal dangling from underneath it as Helga's hands steadied the container rising out of the truck. Then she saw them. \"THERE THEY ARE!\" Milo yelled. As if on cue, the battle began. Bullets filled the air as the armada broke formation, dodging gunfire. Engage all hostiles, Rourke's mind said. And after watching Vinny, he quickly found the Ketak's weapon. With military precision, he aimed and fired. But not at the soldiers. Instead, Rourke targeted the crates of ammunition near each group of soldiers, limiting their resources. He also targeted the rocket launchers that had been set up to fire at the flying craft. One gunshot seemed to cut through the air more than any other, and Rourke saw why when he looked in the direction it, along with the scream that followed it, had come from. Milo's side turned red as his hands flew to it and he cried out in pain, the force of the gunshot throwing the linguist into the side of his Martag, which rolled onto its right side while turning back around toward the Gyro-evac. The roll caused Milo to fall out of the Martag, down toward the gondola...right into the hands of Helga's enormous goon, who had no problem grabbing the scholar's injury, making him scream again. A bullet whizzed by Rourke's head and he quickly took out the flying machine pilot who fired it. From the corner of his eye, he saw Helga drop a weight onto Audrey and Sweet's Martag, destroying it. Thankfully, Mole was there with his Ketak, which they jumped onto and flew away. On the balloon, Helga pointed her gun at Milo's head as her goon held him against the railing with his arms twisted behind his back. Milo's face was twisted in a look of agony caused by both his injury and the way his arms were being held. As Helga raised the gun, Rourke took aim and fired his Ketak's weapon. The energy bolt knocked the gun out of her hand and sent it falling toward the floor of the cavern. Enraged and unable to reach Rourke, Helga instead whirled around and slammed her entire foot into Milo's gut. He immediately doubled over and fell to his knees, his head bowed toward the deck as his now freed arms wrapped around his midsection, coughing and gasping for air. Between Helga and the goon, Milo would be dead within minutes. Not on MY watch! Rourke whipped his Ketak around and swooped low to the deck and jumped off, landing with one foot on either side of Milo, who now lay curled up on his side. The goon recoiled, not prepared to fight a man almost the same size as him. He was a challenge for Rourke in that he was younger and stronger, but Rourke was more skilled and overtook him quickly, throwing him off the side and onto an unsuspecting plane pilot. At the same time, Rourke's Ketak collided with Milo's out-of-control Martag, simultaneously taking out one of the secondary balloons, causing the huge craft to start dropping. Panicking, Helga started throwing barrels off to try and lighten the load. While she was distracted, Rourke swept up Milo and jumped over the side. A piece of debris from the Ketak or Martag had wedged itself in the balloon's propellers, allowing Rourke and Milo to get down to where the crystal hung. But they only got a second's rest as they heard the sound of glass breaking. Helga was climbing down toward them with a fire axe. Rourke tried to shield the injured linguist with his own body, but the top of the container wasn't large enough for all three of them. Before Rourke could think of something to do, the smaller man disappeared over the side. \"Thatch!\" Rourke yelled. \"Oh, did the baby of the group fall?\" Helga said mockingly, \"Better get down there, Lyle.\" She swung at him, making him lean backward over the edge, \"He's gonna have lots of little owies when he gets down there.\" Rourke barely dodged her second lunge as he swung on the chains to the other side of the container. Now their positions were reversed. Helga pulled her axe out of the side of the crystal container and turned to face him. \"Too bad,\" the woman taunted, \"I actually liked you, Lyle.\" \"Don't call me that.\" Rourke growled. \"What, Lyle? It's a nice name.\" She stepped backward, preparing for a wide angled blow he knew he wouldn't be able to dodge. Instead, she dropped the axe and screamed in pain, clutching at her ankle. Rourke stared in shock for a moment as she began to change, her body crystalizing, turning her into some terrifying creature from a nightmare. And then Rourke saw the cause of her transformation. Milo. Brave little Milo, clinging to one of the chains for dear life, a piece of crystalized glass in his hand. He was obviously starting to lose his grip, his side still bleeding, sweat coating his skin. As Helga finished her transformation, Rourke grabbed Milo, wrapping an arm around his chest and hauling him up to the top of the frame, just beneath the balloon. Helga stood looking up at them with fiery pits that used to be her eyes. \"I think we're okay now.\" Rourke said. Milo nodded, Rourke's strong arm being the only thing holding him up. Suddenly, Helga leapt up onto the frame. Rourke thrust his arms out to brace himself against the shift of weight, realizing his fatal mistake just seconds too late. \"NO! MILO!\" he yelled, unable to do anything but watch helplessly as the linguist fell away from him, getting smaller and smaller. Rourke winced when he saw Milo hit the ground, his body crumpling on impact. He felt his eyes sting when Milo just laid there, motionless, where he'd fallen. Above his head, the piece of debris came loose from the propellers, setting them spinning again. When Rourke shifted his weight to look at Milo, the frame's opposite side was raised toward them. And with it, the crystalized Helga. She gave a last shrieking cry before the blades shattered her, the flying shards finally cutting the chains and freeing the crystal, which plummeted to the ground. Rourke managed to shove it out of the way as the flaming balloon crashed down where he had just been. The others landed with their ketaks and began attaching the crystal to one. But Rourke frantically scanned the area until he saw a small crumpled form lying nearby. He ran to it and sure enough, it was Milo. He had obviously broken bones and received a new, bloody wound somewhere. He whimpered softly in pain, and Rourke dropped to a knee beside him, taking the smaller hand in his own. \"I fought back, Rourke.\" Milo gasped and choked out, \"Just like you said.\" \"You did so good, son.\" the commander nodded. This was heartbreaking, seeing the once energetic and determined linguist so badly hurt and in so much pain. He was trained to expect such pain and get through it. Milo wasn't, and it showed in the quiet sobs that shook his tiny form now, the tears that rolled down his face as he struggled against his pain just to breathe. Biting back his own sob, Rourke brushed the hair out of Milo's face and straightened his glasses for him. Suddenly, the ground started to shake. Rourke carefully pulled Milo against him, trying not to hurt the young man even more \"The volcano...She awakes!\" Mole cried. The Ketaks and Martags started taking off again. Suddenly, the hook and loop the crystal was attached with broke off. Rourke quickly ran to it, wrapping the chain around it and securing it. \"GO!\" he yelled to whoever was flying the Ketak as lava started bubbling and bursting out of the ground. As the Ketak started off again, Rourke's eye was drawn back to the dying linguist. He knew he couldn't just leave him here, Milo deserved better. He ran over and quickly scooped Milo into his arms. Then he leapt onto the crystal container, holding on with one hand, the other arm holding Milo tight against him so he wouldn't fall again. The lava flowed mere feet under them, but Rourke held fast to Milo, determined not to let him fall again. You and I will be safe and sound As soon as they were back, an Atlantean pried the container open, releasing the crystalized Kida. But Rourke was oblivious to all of it as he took Milo to the outside of the crowd and gently laid him down. \"We won, Milo.\" he said softly, \"Look up. See the crystal? We won.\" His eyes filled with tears as he said it, though. \"Atlant-tis...s-safe?\" Milo asked. \"Yes.\" Rourke croaked out, \"Yes, Milo. You saved Atlantis. Your grandfather would be so proud of you.\" Before he could stop them, he felt tears leave his eyes. A shaky hand reached up to dry them. \"L-Lyle...don't...\" Milo said, \"Not over m-me...\" This had the opposite effect, as Rourke couldn't even make himself say \"don't call me that.\" In truth, he didn't mind it coming from Milo. He shut his eyes and squeezed Milo's hand against his chest. Milo felt the powerful heartbeat beneath the man's muscular chest and the warmth of Rourke's large hand around his own. Rourke thought back on the entire trip, and how protective he'd become of the linguist, who now lay dying in front of him. Shaking his head, he lifted Milo up to lay against him, brushing the man's hair out of his face again. \"Don't, Milo.\" he said, \"Don't leave me here alone.\" Where had that come from? It was so unlike him, and yet, after spending an entire trip with Milo, it was hard to imagine separating from him. \"I have nobody.\" Milo said softly, \"The museum will say I am crazy and have me either locked up or chained to the boiler. My family is dead. I am single. I have no one to love.\" Me shut his eyes sadly at the last part. \"Wrong again, Thatch.\" Rourke said. \"I don't think you're crazy. If you got locked up, I'd bust you out. And you have someone to love, Milo.\" He leaned in closer, \"You have me.\" Yes. Now it all made sense. He'd fallen for the scholar, and he'd fallen hard. There was no sense in denying it. If he couldn't keep Milo from dying, he at least wanted Milo to know what he felt. \"Y-You, Lyle?\" The commander sighed. How easily Milo could break his resolve. \"Yes, me. I love you, dammit, and I'm not just gonna sit and watch you die. Where the hell is Sweet?\" \"Milo?\" said a woman's voice. Rourke turned and saw that it was the princess. Kida, as Milo had called her. \"He's dying.\" Rourke said, \"Please, there's gotta be something you people can do. Please, help him. At least take away his pain.\" He moved aside and Kida saw what he meant, and she couldn't stop her eyes from watering. Such an innocent young life didn't deserve to end now, especially not with what the larger man had just said. They deserved to be together after what they'd just been through, willingly and knowingly risking their own lives for her and her people. Even now, Rourke carefully dried the tears and blood from Milo's face, their hands still linked as their own doctor shook his head sadly, saying he could administer treatment, but Milo would die before he was done. \"Lyle...\" Milo rasped, \"It's okay.\" \"No it's not, Thatch. This is not okay! Get it through your head. I. Don't. Want. To. Lose. You. Not now, not ever, got it?\" He wasn't actually angry. He knew Milo was struggling with everything he had just to remain conscious. But putting on the facade of anger was the only thing keeping him from bawling his eyes out right there. Suddenly, the Crystal sent out its beams of light again, one of them slamming into Rourke as if it were solid and knocking him aside. It stopped on Milo, the other beams rushing to join the now white beam of light. Just as Kida had been, Milo was slowly lifted upward, his eyes closed as if he were asleep. The pain was completely gone from his face, and while Rourke wanted Milo back down here with him, he was comforted to know the scholar was no longer in pain. If this was his death, at least he didn't suffer. But unlike Kida, Milo didn't become bonded to the crystal. Instead, its light became so bright, it was blinding and obscured him from view. The stones spun around it as they had for Kida, and the light grew even brighter, until a loud crack, like a sonic boom was heard. Then everything was dim and still again. A single beam of light shone down. And then Rourke saw why. This beam was carrying Milo. His eyes were still closed, a blissful look on his face. But what brought out gasps of awe was the fact that his wounds were completely gone, as if they'd never been there. As he got lower, Rourke saw that Milo now had an Atlantean crystal pendant around his neck. Cautiously, the commander stepped into the light and held out his arms, receiving the fully healed Milo. When the beam disappeared and Milo's weight dropped into his arms, he wasted no time hugging the small man close. Milo blearily opened his eyes. \"Lyle?\" he whispered. The man could only nod. \"It was not your time.\" Kida explained, \"You are still needed in this world and you have much ahead of you.\" \"Kida, I don't know if he-\" Rourke was cut off when Milo threw his arms around him. \"Thank you, Lyle. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have fought Helga, and Atlantis would be dead.\" Milo's smile faded for a moment. \"I wish I could be with you that way, Lyle. But I can't go back to the surface. There's a war on, and they'll be initiating the draft soon. You know someone like me wouldn't last in the army...I'm sorry, Lyle, I really am.\" Rourke knew he meant it and he was right about the draft. If he was forced to enlist, Milo would never come home alive. \"Then I'll stay.\" Rourke said, \"I'll stay, here in Atlantis. With you.\" \"Lyle...are you saying you would give up all you've ever known, everything and everyone you have up there, all of that...just for me?\" Rourke nodded. \"Without you, all of that means nothing.\" Milo smiled. God, Lyle loved that smile! \"Then you're going to need this.\" Milo opened his fist to reveal a second crystal pendant. Rourke bent down and let the linguist slip it over his head. Then Milo threw his arms around Lyle again, and this time Lyle hugged him back, holding him close to his heart, running his fingers through soft, smooth brown hair. This was happening! This was real! And it only became better when he heard a soft, almost whisper. \"I love you, too, Lyle.\" To Rourke's surprise, the rest of the crew was happy for them. Milo and Rourke said their goodbyes and received many \"We're really gonna miss you\"s and a can of bacon grease from Cookie, which neither of them was eager to take, but Milo did to be polite. The two sat with the crew and Kida for one last photo before the others piled into the large fish shaped craft. As it lifted off, the wind from it ruffling their hair, Milo turned to Rourke. \"So, what about the paycheck you would have received?\" he asked. Rourke simply put an arm around the linguist and hugged him. \"I don't need money anymore. I'm already the richest man in existence, because I have something far more valuable than money. You.\" Milo smiled and jumped up into his arms. He gladly hugged the small man close as they looked out over Atlantis. They had found the paradise neither knew they sought. The Atlanteans gladly provided them a home, clothing, food, and anything else they needed. Rourke knew there was some sort of imminent war on the surface, and he was thankful they had Atlantis, a place that was basically another world. Where finally Milo, HIS Milo, would never be hurt or insulted or made a fool of again. At last, he knew Milo was Safe and Sound. I know, this may not be my best, but it was mainly written to make me feel better on a day when I felt like total crap. And it achieved that goal, so no flames please.

He was jolted back to reality as soon as his phone started ringing, he answered. \" Is this Frank.\"said the unknown caller. He debated whether to play dumb or go on straight, he eventually chose the latter. \"Yes and whom am I speaking with, \"said Frank. \"That's for me to know and for you to wonder,\"replied the man, and besides you wouldn't like to break your rules would you, I heard they are like your own principles by which you live and besides after this little conversation we are having, you would see why you don't need my name. \" Get on with the conversation, I've got bigger fish to fry and I mean that literally and if this what you want to talk about, go suck a dick.\" this man was beginning to bug him with all this talk and he still hadn't gotten to the point. \" so here's the deal, my boss gave you a job and you declined ,which has never happened and will never happen cause you are going to take on the job and deliver it one way or the other or die trying.\" said the man. \"I told your boss I was not interested, can't you get that through your thick skull.\" said Frank and if you are done I gotta get going. \" wait, you don't want to transport for us, we get that but can you risk the life of your daughter \"said the man \"Good day Mr Frank, nice doing business with you.\"[Chapter 2] Frank sat on a chair with a carton of beer, he started to think about his line of career and wondered if it was only the money that lured him in. One of the problems with being a transporter is that client sees you as more of a tool than a person but when this treatment gets out of hand, then things get ugly. Sometimes he wished that he had never ventured into this business maybe then his daughter will be safe instead of being kidnapped,he took out his phone and dialed the unknown number. \"seems you came to your right senses Mr Frank,but you are sure a surprising person. \" said the man. \"Okay I'll take the job but on one condition.\" said Frank. I see my daughter. \"You will see your daughter when I want you to\" replied the man \"not when you want to. Have a nice day.\" Wait, you never talked about when and where we'll meet and you haven't given me a clue about the supposed job\" said Frank. \"patience Mr Martin, we will soon meet, I just need you to whip yourself into shape cause what you gonna do is gonna require all your skills\" said the man\" 'Goddammit he hung up on me\" yelled frank,\"that son of a bitch is going to pay for this\". Frank went down to the garage and took his Ashton Martin and drove off over to tarconi .[Chapter 3] Frank finally arrived at the building that was texted to him, he smoothed his suit and planted a fake smile on his face and proceeded to ring the doorbell. \"Who the heck are you.\" yelled a guy on the other side of the door. \"I'm the transporter and I'm supposed to meet a guy here at precisely 9:00 this morning.\" replied Frank Immediately he was through with what he said, the door was opened and he was ushered in into the living room. \"Boss will soon be out\" said the unknown guy. I sat down and made myself comfortable on the couch searching for any tiny detail that might actually point out towards my daughter but I found nothing . \"Mr Frank right?, name's Carlos by the way\"he said before plopping down on a chair next to me. \"I heard you were in need of a transporter and now you've got one even if you had to drag an innocent life into it.\" replied Frank. \"let's get down to business now,shall we?\" said Carlos \"I need you to transport a package for me to my partner in the U.S.\" \"About how long is the package and how much does it weigh.\"replied Frank \"The details will be sent to you and the package will also be sent, we will like you to proceed as soon as possible much preferably if its as soon as you get the package.\" replied Carlos \"can i see or at least speak to my daughter before i go?\" said Frank \"NO\" said Carlos Frank stood up calmly after hearing the response made by Carlos, he sauntered towards him and bent his face till they were at eye level and spoke in the calmest way he could muster \"After all this is over, i'll advise you to not cross path with me again and if you choose to ignore this warning, i'll hunt you down and kill you myself\". Frank watched as the Carlos face paled at the threat directed at him and satisfied with what he had seen turned around and started to leave until he heard Carlos yell \"You think you are so tough but it will do well for you to remember that i'm the one holding all the cards and should i decide you are of no use to me any longer, i can dispose of it.\" Frank just turned and said \"enjoy holding the cards as long as you can cause they won't be in your hands for long.\" With that said Frank turned and left the house for his car and drove off home to prepare for the job.[Chapter 4] Third person P.O.V Frank slung his duffel bag on his shoulder stocked with his weapons and headed towards his car, the package lying aimlessly on the back seat. He readjusted the frame containing a picture of him and his daughter on her birthday, he could still remember that day as if it was yesterday, her soft laughter echoing down the halls of the stairway as she ran into his hands knocking them both down, he also remembered her trying to bake her birthday cake herself claiming she was old enough to do it but ended up decorating the kitchen in flower and butter. God, he really missed her which is why he was taking this damn job but first he needed a plan. Normally Tarconi was the one who came up with the plans but he was busy upstate which is why he decided to go with the original plan his brain managed to hatch which actually consisted of only two parts, 1) Take the package and deliver it to whosoever ordered it. 2) Get his daughter back and beat the shit out of those who took her in the first place. Frank never considered himself a good strategist but he had to admit that the plan had a lot of flaws but since there was not enough time to try and come up with another, he was stuck with that. He got into the car and punched in his code, felt his car rumble and drove off. Unknown P.O.V She watched him as he came out of his house and entered his car, she was under strict instructions by her boss to tail him and monitor his every move. She had to warn him about the package he was delivering somehow in a way that won't be able to be traced back to her, she didn't know why but something about him called out to her and intrigued her but she dismissed that thought as she turned on the ignition of her car and started following him.

I do own Kahlaar and the Malbura crew, though. - 1. The Klingon - \"Time jump successful, Captain!\" the helmsman called, \"Heading back to Sol 3 now.\" She rolled her eyes and sighed. \"Earth, Ensign. The planet is called Earth.\" \"Yes Captain.\" the ensign said. Her first officer and husband smiled from where he stood beside her, and she returned it. \"You know the mission?\" he asked. She whipped around to face him. \"Seriously? Do I, the captain AND a general, know the mission?\" The SIC laughed. \"Right, stupid question. Sorry.\" She smiled. \"It's alright, Ch'gren, you're just worried about me. But I promise, I'll be fine. The Council has already prepared everything for me.\" \"I know, I know, but still.\" Ch'gren smirked, \"Admit it. You'd do the same if it were me.\" \"...okay, you're right, I would.\" He laughed and brushed hair out of her face. \"But don't worry, I'll find the petaq and see what they know. And I'll see if our theories are correct.\" She couldn't hide the excitement in her voice. Her mission, as determined by the Klingon High Council, was to accompany a Terran expedition to someplace the Terrans called \"Atlantis\", which the Council had reason to believe had something to do with the ongoing conflict with what had thus far only been called \"demons of air and darkness\". They had searched Terran records in their own time, but all they had found was the date that this expedition had set out. The trip had been publicized as a failure, but the Council suspected that was a coverup, so they decided to plant someone inside the expedition. They had sent ambassadors to make contact with the man who would run the thing, swearing him and everyone involved to secrecy about her presence. What they didn't tell him was that she was also searching for someone who might be an agent of the enemy. She had decided that the best way to start her mission would be to locate the reason for the expedition, the unnamed linguist who had supposedly died on the trip. When they reached standard orbit, Captain Kahlaar and Ch'gren headed for the transporter room. She checked once more to ensure she had everything she would need: an emergency beam-out/distress beacon, a PADD, a tricorder, and her communicator. \"Your things for the trip have been left at the Whitmore place.\" the transporter officer said, \"The quartermaster got you something to wear so you'd blend in here.\" She turned and scowled at the outfit, a frilly floor-length dress with a high collar and long sleeves. A big gaudy hat would cover her forehead ridges. She sighed. At least it was black. \"Don't worry,\" said the TO, \"You can ditch it when you get to Whitmore's They know who and what you are.\" \"Thanks.\" Kahlaar grumbled as she slipped the thing on over her basic uniform, \"Ugh, how did they wear these monstrosities?\" Ch'gren smiled as he tied her Klingon dreds into a tight bun before she put on the hat and he gave her the purse that contained her PADD and tricorder. \"You still look beautiful to me.\" he said. \"Thank you, love, but it doesn't make me hate this thing any less.\" Ch'gren laughed as she stepped onto the transporter. \"We'll be here in orbit if you need us.\" he said. \"Thanks. You're in command until I get back, Ch'gren.\" \"Aye aye, Captain!\" he called as the transporter came to life. She rematerialized in what she realized was the women's bathroom of the museum. She had chosen the location because of its privacy, meaning her appearance wouldn't arouse any suspicion. Her transporter officer had even beamed her into a stall. She quickly made her exit, just as a short fat man in a suit came running by her, followed by a tall thin man in a long coat, large round glasses, and an old Terran explorer's hat. His arms were full of rolled up...somethings...as he ran after the fat man, out the door, down the steps and into a waiting car, where the skinny man finally caught up to him. He shoved most of the rolls into the window of the fat man's vehicle. Kahlaar was about to turn away when she caught the word \"Atlantis\" coming from them. She turned around as the fat man's ride sped off, the skinny man running after it. Cursing under her breath, she lifted her skirts, thankful she didn't have to wear women's shoes from this time, and ran after them. She smirked when she saw the thin man jump onto the front of the vehicle...and almost immediately get thrown off, into a puddle on the side of the road. She stopped when the vehicle backed up. She didn't know what they were talking about, but the fat man flipped a coin at the skinny one before the vehicle took off, its wheels sending up a spray that soaked the other man. Angered, Kahlaar yelled after the fat man. \"YOU HAVE NO HONOR!\" She then turned to the skinny man. \"Are you all right, sir?\" She held out a hand and helped him up. \"Fine.\" he snapped, but then recoiled, \"I'm sorry, miss, I didn't mean to snap like that. I've just...well, I've had my proposal rejected yet again, everybody thinks I'm crazy, and I probably just lost the only job I could get anymore.\" \"Working for who, that petaq* who did this to you just now?\" The man nodded, and they started walking \"I don't know what a 'petaq' is, but yeah, that was my boss. He thinks I'm crazy for wanting to find Atlantis. He did this to my grandfather, too, when he tried to get an expedition to find it.\" Kahlaar scoffed. \"That's no excuse for what he just did. Regardless of whether he believes you, you are still a human being and deserve to be respected and treated like one.\" she asserted. \"Not to Mr. Harcourt. To him, I'm just the guy who fixes the boiler in the museum. I stay in the basement all day.\" \"So he basically imprisons you?\" Kahlaar asked, \"Like you are a slave?\" \"A paid one.\" the man added, \"A paid-very-little one.\" He came to a stop at an apartment building with a door whose color had faded in the sun. Ivy crawled all over the front of the building, the windows were quite dirty, and no lights were on \"Well, this is my place.\" the man said, \"Thanks for getting me up and bringing me home. I wish more people thought like you, lady.\" \"You have much honor, um...\" \"Milo.\" the man said, \"My name's Milo.\" \"Milo.\" Kahlaar repeated. \"Oh, and for what it's worth, I believe you. About Atlantis, I mean.\" \"Thanks, I'm glad someone does.\" Milo gave her a sad smile before he went inside. As soon as he was gone, Kahlaar pulled out her PADD and opened the map of the area she had. Whitmore manor wasn't that far from Milo's apartment. Still, her dress was quite heavy in the rain, so she hailed one of the wheeled vehicles as she'd noticed another person doing earlier. The driver was friendly, and insisted she didn't need to pay him when he saw her soaked clothes. Which was fortunate, as she didn't have a way to pay him. She thanked him immensely when he dropped her off at the door to Whitmore's house. She banged the knocker loudly, and soon a butler opened the door. \" Qa'pla* .\" she gasped. That was the code word she'd been instructed to give Whitmore or his staff when she arrived at the house, so they'd know who she was. Sure enough, the butler nodded and showed her in. As soon as the door closed, she took off her ruined hat and let her hair down. Then she pulled the confounded dress off over her head, sighing heavily and glad to finally be free of the thing. Then she quickly realized she'd thrown it on the carpet! \"Sorry!\" she exclaimed. \"Quite all right, General,\" the butler said, \"Mr. Whitmore's in the exploration room. Just take the elevator.\" \"Thank you,\" Kahlaar stepped into the rickety cage-like structure that passed for an elevator here and pressed the down button. The lift slowly descended, and she had to open the doors herself. She walked out into the huge room, her eyes scanning for Whitmore. \"Ah, General Kahlaar. I see you found the place okay.\" Whitmore had found her, it seemed. The old man, much shorter than her seven foot height, walked up to her, beaming. \"Preston Whitmore at your service.\" She smiled and shook his hand. \"Kahlaar, daughter of Azetbur, House of Gorkon. But you already knew that.\" He nodded. \"Yep, I knew, But it's still nice to hear it from a real person instead of reading it off a document, wouldn't you say?\" Kahlaar laughed. \"I like you already, sir.\" she stated. Preston nodded. \"Now we just need our linguist, and I've sent someone to get him. If all goes well, we'll head to the port tomorrow and get this expedition on its way.\" \"Sounds good to me.\" Whitmore went behind a folded wall and started changing clothes. \"Have the butler show you to your room for the night. He'll let you know when dinner's served if you'd like to join.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Kahlaar said. She went back up and followed the butler to her room, where she lay down and slept right through dinner. * Petaq - Klingon swear word, a vulgar insult. * Qa'pla - Klingon greeting, used similarly to how Hawaiians use \"Aloha\"[Chapter 2] Still don't own Atlantis. Still do own Kahlaar. - 2. Course Set for Atlantis - Kahlaar woke early the next morning and changed into a clean uniform (her officers had replicated a lot of basic uniforms for her to take. As she looked through her things, she felt something hard and smiled when she realized they had even packed her bat'leth. There was also a disruptor to put on her belt, which she did. She then gathered up her things, checking the room one last time to be sure she didn't leave anything, and left. After a quick breakfast from Mr. Whitmore's kitchen, she and her luggage, along with Mr. Whitmore himself, were loaded into a car whose windows had been blacked out. Not that anyone would see her at this time of day. It was still dark out. Once she was in, Whitmore paid the driver and handed him a slip of paper. \"That's your pass,\" he explained, \"Show it at the gate, and they'll let you drive right up to the ship. Miss Kahlaar, here's yours. Hand it to the crew person when we board the ship.\" \"Yes sir.\" the driver answered as they pulled away from the mansion. Kahlaar wasn't sure how long they drove, but finally they arrived at the entrance to the seaport. The driver handed the security person his pass, and the guard nodded, hitting a button inside his booth. A large chainlink gate slid open, admitting the car. \"We're at the very end.\" Whitmore directed, \"Dock A.\" The driver turned and drove along the port until they reached a large sign with a letter A. Workers were already loading crates, vehicles, and cargo onto the huge ship. \"This is our stop.\" Whitmore announced as he climbed out of the car. Kahlaar followed and together they loaded her bags onto a cart. As the car drove off, Kahlaar looked up at the the huge vessel, the cool morning breeze blowing her hair around. \"She probably seems primitive by your standards, but she'll hold up.\" Whitmore said. \"Actually, I was going to say it's very well built for this time.\" She pulled out her pass as they ascended the gangway ramp. The crewman looked half asleep as he took their passes. Whitmore then took hold of Kahlaar's cart. \"I'll put this in your cabin. You go on up to the bow. I think some of our crew is there already. W'ell be at sea for a few days before we reach the launch point for the sub.\" \"Thanks.\" The Klingon waved and headed toward the front of the ship. On the morning of the launch, Kahlaar took a last walk around the decks of the ship. She was headed for the bow again when she heard an awful retching sound. She looked up ahead and saw a man leaning over the railing. \"Carrots.\" he muttered, \"Why is it always carrots, I didn't even EAT carrots.\" He backed up...right into her. \"Ow! Jeez, sorry!\" he exclaimed. She opened the container of live gagh that was going to be her breakfast and pulled out one of the worms. \"Here, eat this,\" she said, handing it to him, \"I know, you humans think eating live worms is gross, but trust me, it'll help with the seasickness.\" At this, the man took the worm without question and slurped it up. \"Thanks...what?\" He looked up into her shocked face. For the seasick man was none other than... \"Milo!\" Kahlaar exclaimed. \"Do I know you?\" She could tell he was staring at her forehead ridges. \"I see you finally got away from Harcourt petaq .\" \"Jiminy Christmas, it's you!\" Milo nearly jumped overboard in surprise. \"You look...um...\" \"Not human?\" She grinned, \"I'm not.\" \"Wow. I mean, I knew there was somebody not human coming with us, but I didn't realize it was you.\" \"Name's Kahlaar,\" she said. \"You're the Klingon Mr. Whitmore told me about last night. But...what were you doing at the museum?\" Milo asked. \"Looking for you, actually. Well, not you specifically, but the linguist who would be part of this expedition. I didn't know his name, but then I heard you mention Atlantis so I got curious and followed you out. And...well, you know where it went from there.\" \"Yeah, I do...Hey, I don't even feel sick anymore. That worm thing really does work...and it didn't taste that bad either.\" Kahlaar smiled triumphantly. She had introduced yet another to the wonders of live gagh. She fished another container of the stuff out of her bag. \"It's called 'live gagh'. Here's some more. You're probably gonna need it.\" Milo took it gratefully. \"All hands to the launch bay.\" came a raspy woman's voice over the ship's speakers, \"And whoever took the 'L' from the 'Motor Pool' sign, ha ha, we are all very amused.\" Kahlaar and Milo exchanged a confused glance as they headed for the launch bay. Milo reported them in with Helga, the first officer on the mission. Kahlaar noted the woman's obvious disdain for Milo and the elderly \"chef\" she was arguing with. Shrugging, Milo joined the Klingon on a cargo elevator that carried them and a group of other men down to the actual launch bay. Kahlaar frowned when she saw the submarine. \"What's wrong?\" Milo asked. \"The sub.\" Kahlaar answered, \"Its hull is too thin and weak to be much use if we have to fight anything. It won't last long in combat.\" \"Great.\" Milo grumbled. Then he picked up a stick of dynamite that fell on the floor and took it to a black haired man who had just asked him if he was looking for the \"pony rides\" whatever those were. Then they heard a familiar voice. \"Milo! Kahlaar! Over here!\" Mr. Whitmore called. He stood in a sailing captain's uniform, complete with a hat, beside a large, bulky man in a military uniform. \"I want you to met Commander Rourke. He'll be leading the expedition. He commanded the team that brought the Journal back from Iceland.\" Suddenly, Kahlaar felt a chill from this man, and she made a mental note to keep an eye on him. \"Milo Thatch. Pleasure to meet the grandson of old Thaddeus. I see you got that journal. Nice pictures, but I prefer a good western myself.\" \"I didn't think you read.\" Kahlaar said dryly, and Rourke looked up-something he probably wasn't used to doing-at her. \"And you must be General Kahlaar. Pleasure to meet you as well, madam.\" Rourke stuck a huge sausage fingered hand out to her. She answered with a glare. \"Don't call me that. 'Kahlaar', 'General', or 'Captain' will be fine.\" \"Very impressive, eh?\" Whitmore asked excitedly. Kahlaar nodded for his sake. \"Boy, when you settle a bet, you settle a bet.\" Milo said, still in awe of everything. He and Whitmore exchanged a few more comments about Milo's grandfather as they walked to the submarine's boarding ramp. Rourke ambled along like a Gorn grunt with them. \"Attention all hands,\" came the raspy woman again, \"Launch will commence in fifteen minutes.\" \"Mr. Whitmore,\" Rourke saluted the old man, \"It's time.\" \"Farewell, Mr. Whitmore.\" Kahlaar said, the old man giving her a smile. \"You have much honor. Qa'pla!\" \"Bye Mr. Whitmore!\" Milo called as he practically dragged Kahlaar up the ramp. \"Make us proud, boy!\" Whitmore called after Milo as the door ground shut. Despite her discomfort with the vessel, she couldn't help but feel excited and a little giddy as they were about to get underway. She laughed to herself as she and Milo ran to the front of the sub, stopping on one of the catwalks in the huge glass sphere structure at the front of the vessel, looking out the giant window at the crew of the freighter that had carried them out here. And there, in the very center, in front of everyone else, was Mr. Whitmore, waving as the sub splashed into the water, freed from the hooks that held it above the open launch doors. Milo and Kahlaar waved back as the ship began to sink, the water rising up the sides of the sphere structure. Mr. Whitmore gave them a last joyous smile before the waterline rose above their heads and he disappeared from view. Now the freighter was shrinking above them, and below them, the dark waters of their destination. Together, human and Klingon braced themselves on the railing, preparing themselves for whatever mysteries those waters held.

Lowry","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4885548","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Frank Martin sat comfortably on the back deck, enjoying a glass of very expensive wine and waiting patiently. Tarconi had invited him over to test out his new barbeque and was grilling up some steaks. It wasn't going to take too long to cook since both men enjoyed their meat medium rare. Tarconi invited him over for something to eat every now and then, but Frank didn't remember him ever going out of his way to pamper him with such an elegant menu. The wine cost at least a hundred euros a bottle and he even had some hors d'oeuvres waiting for him when he arrived. Rather than say anything just yet, Frank remained seated and kept his thoughts to himself while sampling the wine. He enjoyed the view from Tarconi's deck anyhow. The view of the city was breathtaking, and it was something he always took in because he couldn't stand taking up residence in an area as crowded as Paris. Frank liked the view, but he was the kind of man who needed more space, hence the reason why he preferred to live outside of town and in a more rural setting. Tarconi finally came back to the table with two plates, and seemed very proud of himself as he brought to two succulent piece of meat to the table. \"Here you go my friend, medium rare and a potato on the side. Bon Appetite.\" \"Merci.\" Frank said as he sat up and started to dig in. \"\"This looks really good. I can't remember the last time I had a hearty steak.\" \"There is nothing wrong with a little red meat my friend, but like all good things it must be taken in moderation.\" his friend took a seat opposite of him and started to eat the steak. \"This is fantastique.\" Tarconi said as he took the first bite, \"I was a little worried about grilling it myself but I am proud to say I am a natural.\" Frank laughed and put a hand up to his mouth to prevent anything from coming back up from the convulsions. \"It's delicious, thank you.\" \"You're very welcome.\" After a few bites, Tarconi looked at the bottle. \"I think it's time to open another bottle of wine. Don't you?\" \"I'm sorry, why are you being so nice today?\" Frank suddenly asked. \"What do you mean?\" Tarconi retorted with a question of his own? \"Well, the expensive wine, the hors d'oeuvres, the steaks. This is all great, don't get me wrong… but it's not my birthday and I checked my blackberry to confirm it's not yours either. Is there some good news you have to bring up or are you buttering me up to ask for something?\" Tarconi smiled and took another bite from his steak. \"I guess the wine was pushing it a little.\" he confessed, \"The reason why I have asked you here was to ask you for a favor. Now don't get upset, if you don't want to do it... we'll just finish supper and that will be that.\" \"Okay.\" Frank said as he put down his fork, \"You have definitely aroused my curiosity. What exactly are you going to ask of me?\" \"I need you to do a job.\" Tarconi asked. \"You're a cop.\" Frank replied, \"I don't think it's legal for you to hire me for the kind of jobs I do.\" \"First of all, it's not that kind of job.\" Tarconi said as he took another sip of his wine. \"This one is vastly different and the police don't know anything about it. This is a personal favor to me.\" Frank took attention to this since Tarconi had never really approached him for a personal favor before. \"What kind of job is this going to be?\" \"A close friend of mine is a member of parliament.\" \"Which branch?\" Frank asked. \"The national assembly.\" Tarconi quickly answered, \"But very soon he will be announcing his intention to seek a higher office. Most of us are sure he will try to run for President.\" \"What are his chances?\" \"I don't think they're good, but he's ambitious. Men like that scare people and make them nervous especially after what happened in the States with Obama.\" \"So where do I come into the picture?\" Frank quickly asked, eager to find out what Tarconi was up to. \"Right now my friend is hiring staff to make up for the campaign when it gets into full swing. Since I work with law enforcement, I've been asked to recommend some good people to add to his staff. People he can trust without hesitation. I'm going to recommend you as his new personal driver.\" \"You want me to be his new chauffeur?\" \"No, I want you to be his bodyguard.\" \"Won't he have his own people for that?\" \"He will, but I want you to be the wild card.\" Tarconi said as he resumed eating his meal, \"The last line of defense that the opposition won't be aware of. There's a good chance you'll never have to get involved in anything and just drive the man around, but I'll make sure you're paid nicely for your time.\" \"If I do this job, it won't be for the money but I do appreciate the fact that some of it will come my way.\" \"I appreciate that. I'm asking you because I'll just feel better knowing you're the man behind the wheel if things get sticky.\" Frank picked the wine back up and took another hearty swig. \"You're gonna have to open another bottle while I think about this.\" Tarconi laughed out loud. \"I guess I asked for that, huh?\" he left the table and went to fetch another bottle from the kitchen. Frank sat there and thought about what was being asked of him. There was something missing from this assignment. Something that Tarconi knew but wasn't telling him. He had to know what that was before accepting this job. When Tarconi came back to the table, he refreshed both their glasses and then sat back down. Frank took a quick sip of the slightly chilled wine. \"I need to say something; I don't think you're telling me everything. This man you're asking me to protect, there's something about him that makes him special than all the others, isn't there? Why are you going out of your way to protect him without him knowing about it?\" Tarconi knew nothing was going to get by Frank and he paused for a few moments. \"He's my brother. Half brother really, but isn't that close enough? Dad had a few more kids after he and my mother divorced a long time ago. We don't always see eye to eye but since he was elected to the assembly, we've gotten much closer through our professional relationship.\" It was all making sense to Frank. Tarconi wasn't asking him to watch a close friend but a member of his own family. Someone so close to him that only Frank was the person he could trust with that security. When he thought about it, it was quite a compliment to ask someone to watch over family and Tarconi was showing a lot of trust in Frank by asking him to do this highly secret job for him. \"You've been holding out on me.\" Frank said with a smile, \"Your brother is going to run for President?\" \"I know, I know.\" Tarconi said with a grin, \"I told you he's very ambitious. When I first talked to him about it I told him he would have a better chance trying to run for the Senate first. You know build up some more experience and rapport with the people before making a run at high office but he'd have none of it. For him it's either all or nothing, that's just the kind of man he is. He also thinks this coming campaign season is the best chance for him with the current field. Like it or not, he's going to run. You have to admire the kid for his… gusto.\" His friend had a hearty chuckle before he drowned it with another sip of wine. \"That's one word for it.\" Frank said with a chuckle. He pushed his plate aside as he was finished eating. The steak was gone but he had left half of his potato intact. He paused for a few moments, and then turned back to Tarconi. \"I'll do it on three conditions.\" \"Name them.\" Tarconi said eager to negotiate final terms. \"No one can know what I really do. As far as they know I'm just the driver.\" \"That's the plan. I don't want them to know anything unless it's absolutely necessary.\" \"Two, I only answer to you and your brother. Technically only you when it comes to matters of security.\" \"Of course,\" Tarconi concurred, \"And the third?\" \"I drive my own car.\"[Chapter 2] Frank pulled up to his designated location around ten minutes ahead of schedule. As he came to a stop and turned off the ignition, he sat there for a few moments to compose himself. Part of him was determined to do this out of loyality, to his friend and the fact that this was his brother. Yet another part was hesitant to go through with this plan, thinking of one of his biggest rules: never make a promise you can't keep. If this campaign was going to be half as crazy as Tarconi said it was going to be, he was unsure what difference he would make. But a promise was a promise, and Frank was at least determined to try to make sure the rule went unbroken. As he walked up to the front door, he checked his suit to make sure it was all right. He wore was what us customary outfit, consisting of a black suit, white shirt and a black tie. Regardless of what job he was applying for, Frank too pride in his work and did his best to be professional and looking good was one of the elements required to doing just that. After he rang the doorbell, Frank took a moment to brush his jacket with is hands to clean himself up at the last moment From what he was told, Tarconi was confident that his brother was likely going be one of those candidates that hung in there for a short while but will withdraw when the numbers or his finances get too low. Famous last words, Frank thought to himself as he stood waiting at the door, wasn't that the same thing everyone said about Obama? The door opened, and a lady greeted him at the door with a smile. Frank could immediately tell by the uniform that she was the help of the house, either the maid or the cook. \"Hello there.\" she said with a sweet smile, \"Can I help you?\" \"Yes, I have an appointment with Moseuir Latimer.\" \"Are you expected?\" \"Yes, I'm the new driver.\" \"Oh.\" she said with a look of surprise, \"Please, come in.\" Frank stepped inside and quickly realized that he was beiong shown a little professional courtesy, from one member of the staff to possibly the next. He did his best to show a small smile and waited in the foyer while she went off to get someone for him. As he slowly strolled around and looked at the massive fraimed potraits and photos in the hallway. The family man, the wife and the little ones. Picture perfect for a run in any campaign, Frank thought as he strolled down the hallway. As he spanned across the many pictures, he noted one glaring omission: Tarconi. Even though they were not full blooded brothers, he fould it surprising how his friend was pretty much behind the scenes rather than up front. Usually someone in the police is something to be proud of, as they serve and protect the people. But not this time, but it was something he was going to have to keep to himself while concentrating on the job at hand. Suddenly the man from the pictures came strolling into the foyer, hand extended in friendship. \"Mr. Martin, a pleasure to meet you.\" Frank took his hand and gave it a gentle shake. \"The pleasure is mine, Sir.\" \"Please, call me Pierre.\" \"I'm afraid I can't. Professional habit.\" \"I understand. I am glad to have you on my staff, my last driver didn't pass security checks and you came highly recommended.\" \"I normally don't work for public officials, but in this case I am making an exception.\" \"I appreciate that. This is going to be an interesting campaign.\" \"So I've been told.\" \"'I've been told your driving skills are second to none.\" \"Our common aquaintence has a knack for bragging too much.\" \"That he does, but I'm happy to have you on board.\" \"I'm glad to be here. How soon do I start?\" \"I leave for work in an hour.\" \"My car is outside, we'll be waiting.\" \"That's right, I forgot about that condicition.\" he said with a smile as he left to get his things. Frank went outside and took a few minutes to wipe some dirt off the side of his car as he waited for Mr. Latimer to emerge from the building. His new employer later emerged from the house and whistled as he approached Frank's vehicle. \"Is this an Audi A8?\" \"Close.\" Frank said as he walked over to open the door for Mr. Latimer, playing the good driver. \"It's a customized S8, with a W12 under the hood.\" \"Really? Fantastic!\" Latimer said with a laugh as he happily stepped into the back seat. After he stepped into the car, he took a quick look around taking note of a lot of things that were custom about this car. Once Frank slipped into the driver's seat, he asked his first question. \"Where's the ignition?\" \"It's automated.\" Frank replied as he punched a code into the keypad under the radio. The machine reeved to life seconds after the code was punched in. Latimer laughed again, impressed with the high tech additions to Frank's car. After turning the car on, Frank paused for a moment before speaking. \"Seat belt, please.\" he politely asked his passenger. \"Excuse me?\" \"Rules of the car: Seat belt.\" \"How many rules are there?\" \"Three.\" \"Well, that's not too many to go by.\" Latimer replied as he put on his seatbelt. \"What are the other two?\" \"Rule number one,\" Frank started as he pulled away from the curb, \"Respect a man's car and a man respects you.\" he took a sharp turn into traffic. \"Rule number two, greet a man when you step into his car.\" \"And obviously the third.\" Latimer said as he snapped the top of his seatbelt to indicate it was on. \"Exactly.\" Frank said as he took another turn off the main road. \"Why are we turning here? This isn't our exit.\" Latimer asked, somewhat cunfused. \"This is one of five routes I have mapped out to your place of work.\" Frank explained as he made another turn. \"I will be picking your route to work randomly, sometimes even making stops to make sure people cannot time your arrival. For example, we will stopping for expresso for ten minutes in two blocks. This will prevent people from being able to track your route to work for possible assaults.\" \"Isn't that a little overprotective?\" Latimer asked. All he got in response to that was a cold stare from the front via the rear view mirror. \"You're the driver, I guess if you deem this is necessary.\" \"I do.\" \"Then expresso it is. Will we have time for a danish?\" \"Sure.\" Frank replied, \"As long as you don't eat it in the car...\"[Chapter 3] After stopping at the cafe for expresso, Frank took his time moving along, never speeding as he went along his pre-planned route to get Moseuir Latimer to work. He stopped perfectly in the zone where members of the national assembly were dropped of. Before Moseuir Latimer stepped out of the car, Frank turned back to face him. \"What time do you finish work?\" \"Usually around three in the afternoon.\" Latimer replied. \"I usually step out for lunch around...\" \"Not today, Sir.\" Frank replied as he passed him a paper bag. \"Today you're eating lunch in your office.\" \"Are you serious?\" he asked as he took a quick glance into the bag. \"I picked it up at the cafe. You'll like it... it's very healthy and good for you. Like I said before, no traceable routines.\" Frank said, \"You'll eat lunch in the office today and then go out tomorrow. Today I will be stopping here at exactly ten after three. Be here and don't show up early. Stay inside until the exact moment I ask.\" He passed him a piece of paper with some information on it. \"That is my contact number. If you need me to pick you up early, call or text my cell and I'll be back here as fast as I can. All right?\" \"All right.\" Moseuir Latimer said as he took off his seat belt. \"I want you to know that the only reason why I am tolerating any of your paranoia is because you came highly recommended.\" \"Thank you.\" Frank stepped out of the car and walked over to the passenger door and opened for him. \"Have a good day, Sir.\" Moseuir Latimer couldn't make out what was going through his new driver's head but shook it off as he nodded and proceeded to enter his building of work. Frank was aware that some of his tactics were weird, but there was nothing wrong with a little morning coffee and lunch in office that would cause people to think twice. Just something that will keep others on their toes. Moseuir Latimer was likely wondering if his new driver was a bit loonie and wore tin foil on his head when not at work, but Frank was just going by his instincts and his training. What he didn't tell Moseuir Latimer was that two cars had been spotted in several locations while on their way to work that day. Whenever Frank stopped at a red light, he took the time to write down their make, model and plate information. There was no need to panic yet, but it was good to keep an eye on any vehicle that might resemble any kind of tail. Like he had told his new employer, the next day would use a new route with no stops for expresso and he might even run fast through some yellow lights to see how desperate they are to catch up if any of these cars were tailing him. As he was driving away from the drop off, there was a call. Frank looked down and then hit the button to activate the speaker. \"Is there something I can help you with?\" he calmly asked. \"Non.\" the voice answered. It was Tarconi. \"I was just calling to check up on you. How was the first ride to work?\" \"It was all right.\" Frank honestly answered. \"Moseuir Latimer seemed a little off set by my desired route to take him to work but he went with it.\" \"That is good.\" Tarconi said, \"I told him some of your methods might be a tad odd, but it was all for his safety, which I said you were in great knowledge of.\" \"Nice.\" Frank said as he turned another corner. \"Nothing like setting great expectations.\" \"You've never failed to meet them yet, my friend.\" \"Don't get cocky. This is another job and the best way to be successful is to keep your eyes open.\" As he said that, Frank noticed one of the cars he had been tracking three cars back. \"I'll call you if there are any developments.\" Rather than run from the potential tail, Frank started to slow down and give his follower a chance to catch up. He waited for close to ten minutes for the right time, when the cars between them dwindled until there was no one between them. This is when he slammed on the brakes. Two seconds later there was a loud squealing sound as his tail was unable to stop in time, slamming into the back of Frank's car with a loud thud. Frank turned off the car and got out, making sure that when he did there was a look of complete disgust on his face. \"Look what you did?\" he pointed to the back. There was only a dent in the bumper that he could easily fix but he wanted to make it look like he was just a driver that was going to have to pay hand over fist to get it repaired at the shop. Something that would piss off anyone who was driving a car as fine as his so a performance was in order. \"What I did?\" the driver of the other car said as he stepped out. \"You caused this when you slammed on your brakes!\" \"There was a child crossing the road!\" Frank said as he waved to a sign, \"This is a school zone! The only way you could have hit me is if you were speeding!\" \"I was not speeding you son of a...\" \"Excuse me, is there a problem here?\" Both men turned to see an on duty police officer, walking over from his car to see what was holding up traffic in the area. \"Yes there is.\" Frank said as he walked over to the officer. \"This man rear ended me, and he's refusing to give over his insurance information.\" \"Is this true?\" the officer said as he looked over at the other driver. \"If you refuse to give over your information, I'll assume it's because you have none and you'll be spending the night in jail.\" The other driver looked at Frank with a look that said he wanted to kill him, but then looked back at the officer. \"Of course I have the proper papers. I'll get it right now.\" It took a few moments, but he came back with the information that Frank needed. After he handed it over to the officer, Frank smiled. \"Don't worry about the damage. I know a good mechanic that does my work for a good price. I'll send you the bill.\" He didn't reply and went back to his car. Frank took the information from the officer and got back into his car as well. As he pulled out and was back on his way, he noticed that the tail had left him behind. It was obvious to him that Frank had made him and used the accident to get his information. Frank punched a number into his cell and turned the speaker back on. After a few rings, he got a familiar voice back on the line. \"Hello?\" \"Tarconi, it's Frank. I need you to look something up for me.\"[Chapter 4] Frank decided to take a new route home, still a little cautious over what had occurred earlier in the day. He had alternate routes home made out just for this purpose, and it was only going to take an extra fifteen minutes of his time to be sure he wasn't being tailed. It was less than twenty minutes after he had dropped his boss off at home when the driver noticed something at least several cars behind him. he was being followed, but it was clear the driver of that car was trying his best not to be spotted. Clearly the person was unaware of how good Frank was at his job cause he had noticed him following and started to change his route again just to test him. Sure enough the car kept track, several cars behind. Losing his patience, Frank dialed a number in the phone that was attached to the car. After a few rings there was a pick up. \"Hello?\" \"Tarconi, it's Frank. How are we doing with that name I gave you earlier today.\" \"So far nothing has come up. I'm going to send it to interpol if this search turns up nothing.\" \"Well, that tail is back. It looks like they're trying to follow me home.\" Frank said as he took another quick turn and slowed down. \"This doesn't look very good.\" \"No, it doesn't.\" Tarconi agreed. \"What do you want to do, Frank?\" \"I've got an idea. It's time to hit the grocery store.\" Frank said when a grin as he turned into the parking lot to a local grocery mart. \"Keep looking into that name and get back to me when you find something.\" \"All right.\" Tarconi replied. \"Be careful, my friend.\" Frank disconected the line and pulled to a stop in the parking lot. He popped the trunk and stepped out of the vehicle very casually. He had some reusable grocery bags in the back that he took out and casually closed the trunk. As far as any followers were concerned, Frank had stopped to pick up some groceries. This was Frank's way of testing his tail, to see how far they were ordered to go after what happened earlier today. After entering the store, he took a cart and tossed his bags into it. After picking up a few vegetables and fruits, he got his answer as a few large men, including the one that he got the insurance information that Tarconi was checking had entered the store to look for him. Frank got the feeling there were not just there to follow him but to possibly take the nosy driver out of the picture. Frank didn't respond and kept shopping, but it was at this time that Frank decided to buy a new mop. He took a very sturdy stick, with a heavy wooden shaft that seemed to his liking. He then walked over to the meats and pretended to browse for something, using the window from the deli to watch his followers as they looked around the store for him. Since Frank was in a very pricey suit, it didn't take long for some one to spot him at the meats section and they quickly whisked over to where he was. Frank watched carefully to make sure they didn't reach for any weatpons, which they likely and very foolishly didn't think they needed. One of the big men grabbed Frank by the shoulder and turned him around. \"We need to speak with you.\" Frank pretended to play dumb for a moment. \"What the hell is your problem.\" then when the person from the car accident earlier in the day became visable, he cracked a smile. \"I told you the bill wasn't going to be that much, I will send you the bill for the damage to my car.\" \"We're not here to talk about that.\" The other man said as he pulled out a gun and stuck it into Frank's ribs. \"You're coming with us, quietly.\" \"What is the meaning of this?\" Frank said, still playing dumb. \"You blokes are way too fat to be cops. Is this a stick up?\" \"Just shut up and walk.\" the man replied. \"But my groceries...\" Frank protested. \"You won't be needing them where you're going.\" That was all Frank needed to hear. The moment the guard gave out his true intentions, the driver acted. With one quick slap, he removed the gun from his ribs long enough to make the next shot, which was a solid punch from his other arm directly to the man's sterim that not only knocked the wind out of him, but dropped the big man to the ground. The other man from the accident attempted to pull out his gun, but Frank was too quick as he spun around and removed the gun from his hand with a perfect round house kick. From there Frank noticed there were two more men running to assist, and this is when he walked back to his cart. he removed the mop from the car and with a stift kick, removed the bottom part of the mop, leaving Frank with a short but lethal staff to ward off his attackers. The man from the accident attempted to run at Frank, but all he got for his efforts was multiple strikes from his new weapon, in the chest, back of his head and in the grion area before Frank slapped him in the back of his knees to take him off his feet. As the other two arrived, Frank moved on to another weapon as he picked up the gun he kicked out of the other goon's hands and rather than point it at the goons running over, he pointed it to the ceiling and fired off a few rounds, which in turned caused a panic and had people running and screaming for their lives. With the people running and the sound of sirens in the backfround, the other goons fled the scene rather than back up their men. Frank picked up the man whom he met earlier from the accident and flopped him up against the deli window. He pointed his own gun at him, \"Who sent you?\" \"I'm not saying anything.\" the goon replied. \"Let me rephrase that.\" Frank responded as he pulled the trigger and put a bullet into his shoulder. \"Why are you coming after me?\" \"We did a background check on you.\" the man said, in obvious pain. \"We know you're ex-special forces. We had to take you out before...\" the man then paused. \"Before what?\" Frank said as he pressed the gun into his shoulder wound. The man screamed in pain, \"Before we made a move on Latimer...\" Frank paused for a moment, and then slapped the man in the head with his own gun and dropped it. He was about to walk away when a phone rang. It wasn't his. Frank fished the phone out of the man's pocked and opened it. \"Yes.\" he said in a dark and deep voice.\" \"Is the driver out of the picture?\" the voice at the other end asked. \"Yup.\" Frank answered, trying his best to impersonate the person he just knocked out. \"Good.\" the voice answered. \"Try to get back to Latimer's house. We make our move in 20 minutes.\" Frank paused for a moment and hung up the phone. He then started to make a mad dash for his car. He qucikly jumped in and punched the code in to roar the car back to life. As he squealed out of the parking lot as quickly as he could, he used his own phone to dial a number. \"Frank, we're still looking.\" Tarconi said as he answered, \"It's not going to go any faster when you...\" \"We have a problem.\" Frank said as he took another sharp turn at very high speeds. \"Someone just tried to kill me and your brother is next... meet me at his place, now!\"[Chapter 5] Frank did his best to weave through the heavy traffic on his way back to the Latimer house, but Tarconi was way ahead of him. He had units stationed down the block under his orders to move when ordered to. No one knew they existed except the inspector so when Frank arrived, the lights were already flashing in front of the house and officers were stationed everywhere. The driver quickly hopped out of his car and scanned the area. There didn't seem to be anything going on as there were no hostiles in sight, which left Frank at a loss as he continued to look around. He crossed the road and started to study the road with a flashlight he had produced from his car, looking around for clues. He came upon something and cursed to himself as he kept looking around. Tarconi finally arrived on the scene and saw Frank snooping around and walked over to where he friend was. \"Is everyone all right?\" he quickly asked. \"No one's hurt.\" Frank said as he pointed to the ground with his flashlight. \"But someone was watching the house. There are cigarette butts right there on the corner, and fresh skid marks. Whoever it was, they likely peeled off after your surprise units showed up.\" \"Which are now no longer a surprise to anyone.\" \"Exactly.\" Frank replied as he stood up. \"This was a test to see how fast we would respond to a threat. Whoever is trying to intimidate your brother just made us prematurely show our hand.\" \"Son of a bitch.\" Tarconi cursed as he kicked the wheel of the car next to them. \"What about the men at the grocery store?\" Frank asked. \"They managed to get away before our unit arrived.\" Tarconi answered, 'Which means we have nothing!\" \"Let's go talk to your brother.\" Frank said as he turned off the light. The two men walked into the building and up the stairs to the upper foyer where the family were huddled and trying to settle down. \"Is everyone all right.\" Tarconi said as he came up the stairs. \"We're fine.\" Mr. Latimer said but it was obvious he was not amused. \"What is the meaning of all this? We were trying to sleep?\" \"We had received a threat.\" Tarconi replied. \"Turns out it was a prank but it was too detailed to not take seriously. I am very sorry for disturbing you and your family. We will go now.\" As they were descending the stairs, Frank leaned over and whispered, \"Why didn't you tell him anything?\" \"With what evidence?\" Tarconi replied. \"We have nothing. He wouldn't believe me anyway and even though they know who you are, I still want him in the dark until absolutely necessary.\" \"All right, this is your show.\" Frank said as he started to walk for the door. \"And you are staying at my place tonight.\" Tarconi added. \"What for?\" \"They know who you are Frank.\" Tarconi explained, \"It's not a stretch to assume they also know where you live too.\" Frank stopped for a moment and pondered that fact. \"They don't know that we know that.\" \"What are you thinking, my friend?\" Tarconi asked. \"The big man at the grocery told me that they were going to take me out before making any moves on your brother.\" Frank said with a grin. \"So let them come after me. Better me than them, right?\" \"I'll have some units dispatched to your house.\" Tarconi said as he was catching on to what Frank was thinking. \"I'll have them set a perimeter but not approach the house. Do you have a plan Frank?\" Frank grinned, \"When was the last time you visited my place?\" ","Summary":" Frank Martin sat comfortably on the back deck, enjoying a glass of very expensive wine and waiting "},{"Movie":"Transporter","Title":"Fate?","Author":"Zoeyscares","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2808391","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer\" I Don't own anyonenfrom Transporter.

She watched him like she did everynnight when he was there. She didn't know who he was, (besides thatnhis name was Frank), or where he was from, though his accent sort ofngave him away. One thing she did know was that whenever he was in hernbar, he was doing business. And judging from her instinct, it wasn'tnvery safe, and probably very illegal. But that wasn't her job tonshare her opinions, it was to serve the customer, and the customernwas always right. Making her way over she stood in frontnof him, he didn't look at her, he never did, eyes always on the door,nwaiting for his next assignment. But she knew he had to drink somentime, and she knew exactly what would come next. \"Water, bottled, not open,...\" \"...or chilled, medium sized glass,nwith 4 cubes of ice\" She said looking down at her note pad writingnit. She didn't need to, but it made her look busy. He turned towardnher, looked her up and down, she raised her head smiling. \"Am I mistaken?\" He didn't say anything , just stared atnher, now she wished he never looked at her. Those eyes will haunt hernfor the rest of her life. Finally he spoke, breaking the trance. \"No, it's fine\" \"Coming right up...\" She put her pencil back behind her earnand notepad in her apron.

Grabbed the glass and shoveled four cubes of ice into it.nTaking a tray she set it down and walked back over to him. He now hadncompany. She made a disgusting sound to herself. It was one of thenmen who had been coming in every week watching Frank. Not only didnshe dislike this man, he had tried to get her to sleep with him fornthe past week. It was not pleasing, so swallowing her pride andnwalked over and set the tray in front of Frank. \"One bottle of water, unopened, notnchilled, medium glass, with 4 cubes of ice...is that all I can getnfor you this evening Frank\" \"Thats all for now Terri\" He saidnwhile pouring the bottle of water into the glass.

He watched as she put on a fake smile and nodded hernhead. \"Anything else?\" \"Your number?\" Frank coughed on his water. He grabbedna napkin and turned away to wipe his mouth. \"Let's get back on track here, I'm onna schedule\" He said to hurry things along. \"Just a Bourbon Sour\" Terri walked away to let them talk, andnmixed the other mans drink. She set it on the tray and then walkednback over to them handing it to the man with Frank. She came in onnthe end of their conversation. \"It will arrive precisely at 12 pmnthat afternoon.

The man wiped the blood offnhis face and backed up, right into Bubba, the bouncer. \"Deals off\" Frank said as the othernman was escorted out of the club. Frank walked over to where he wasnsitting, and started to help Terri clean up the mess. \"Sorry about that,\" Frank said.nTeri wiped her forehead and smiled. \"Comes with the job I suppose...\"nFrank stopped and looked at her \"I meant, being anbartender...idiots like him don't go well with the truth. But nicenjob though...with the whole flipping things you just did\" When shensaid flipping she tried to reenact with her hands. But failed, henlaughed and then pulled out his wallet. He pulled out a hundred andnwas about to give it to her, she stopped him. \"No, its ok, it wasn't your fault, Inwas the one\" She rambled but he stopped her. \"I insist\" She hesitated for a moment then tooknthe money. She was about to say something when her boss came out andnwaved across the room for her. \"I got to go...duty calls\" \"Yeah, me to, thanks for the water\" \"Thanks for the bar brawl\" He laughed, she could never get tirednof that laugh. \"Yeah...welcome for that, goodnightnTerri\" \"Good night Frank...\" He walked out the door and Terri walkednover to her boss, time to face the music. 1 hour later Terri was ecstatic to be let off early, but she wasn't ecstatic aboutnhaving to walk to her apartment in the dark, at two o clock in thenmorning on a Sunday. She knew the risk, this was LA, but it's thenprice you have to deal with when you cant afford to fix your car.nSomething wasn't right though. Wrapping her coat around her she stopped and looked behind her. Nonone. She turned back and wrapped the coat tighter, as if it was somenway to protect herself. Slipping her hands into her pockets shencontinued walking. She heard a noise behind her and turned around.nNothing. She sighed and told herself it was nothing and continuednwalking. She was about a block away from home when she heard anothernsound behind her and she turned around, it was nothing, just a car onna trash can. She put a hand up to her chest and laughed. Turningnaround she said to herself... \"Terri your justing imaging things...AHH\". She screamed whennthere in front of her was the man from earlier at the bar. He grabbednher and turned her around so that his chest was pushed against hernback. He pressed and knife up to her throat. \"Stupid Bitch I needed him, and you had to go and piss me off. Nownthanks to you I'm up shit creek. So now I'm gonna make you pay.\" Hencarried her down the street to an alley, with her kicking and tryingnto get away. She wasn't succeeding. He turned her again and pressednher up against the wall, choking her. He held the knife in his teethnand attempted to undo his pants. Terri didn't know what to do, shenwas pinned against a wall, being choked to death and now was about tonbe raped. Only a miracle could save her now. Then suddenly \" 'Ello mate\" A punch sent her attacker flying off of her and she slid down thenwall, instantly bringing her hands to her throat. She tried to movenand get up but she couldn't feel her legs. She heard lots of noisesnand yelling, and then it suddenly went quiet. A dark figure knelt in front of her, she tried to fight him off \"Terri! Terri! It's Frank! Can you hear me? Are you ok?\" That British voice was the last thing Terri heard before slippingninto total darkness. \"Bloody Hell\" Was the choice of words he uttered when he felt Terri slipnunconsciousness. He did was any other man would do. He took off hisnjacked and wrapped it over her body, seeing as her coat was ripped innthe attack. Picked her up in his arms and carried her to his car. Driving back to his home he opened the gate and drove up to hisngarage. After parking the car, he went to the back seat to get Terri,nhe picked her up and brought her into his house. Carrying her to thenguest room he set her on the bed, after making she she was alright henwalked out shutting the door. Going downstairs he un tucked hisncuffs, and he undid his tie. Then walked over to the alarm systemnpunched the code and set it on. Unbuttoning his shirt he walked backnupstairs to his room, shutting the door, hoping for a quiets nightsnrest. Chapter 1 is doooone! Yay? Want more? Review? Ok. :)[Chapter 2] Disclaimer\" I Don'tnown anyone from Transporter. Oh I wish I did though. Anyway. Terrinand Bubba and anyone else not in the movies are mine. Ok? A/N: Chapter 2 :)nReview? Terri woke up and lookednaround wondering where she was. She put her hand on her head, thennthen brought it down to her neck, last nights events suddenly washingnback to her. She leaned back into the pillows and sighed, rubbing hernface with her hands. She pushed back the covers and sat on the edgenof her bed. She was in the same clothes she had on yesterday. She gotnup and walked over to the bathroom, which was in the room. Shencringed at what she looked like. Noticing a note on thentable next to her she un folded it. Terri, Good morning, take anshower, get dressed. I'll be back in a few. Frank \"Well hello to you tonFrank\" She laughed and then looked at the pile under neath thennote, brand new outfit. She was taken a bit by surprise, this didn'tnseem like the kind of man she thought he was. Then again she reallyndidn't know him. Shrugging it off she complied and took a shower,nshortly after she got dressed. He had good taste for her...it was allnthe necessities and then a nice t shirt, and some jeans. Size was anbit big, but her small frame fit into them. She brushed her dirtynblond hair and then ran her hands through it to add some life to it.nIt wasn't very long, but it wasn't short either. Giving herself thenok, she left the room. Making her way down thenstairs. It was a huge house, she was used to big, but this wasnclassy. Wasn't tacky like some mansions she had been to, but itnscream, rich. She liked it. Walking into the kitchen she spotted yetnanother note. Breakfast, milk in thenfridge, bottom self. Also, your purse is on the counter. Andnsure enough underneath it was cereal and a bowl with a spoon. Shenlaughed and got the milk, and poured herself breakfast. She felt verynawkward just sitting there by herself. She saw that he had a balconynlooking over the Vally. She picked up her bowl and then walkednoutside, setting her bowl on the ledge she took in the amazing view.nIt was very peaceful. After finishing her Breakfast she got hernpurse. She took out her cell phone, she had 11 missed calls. All fromnDonny. She rolled her eyes and tossed the phone on the chair, he cannwait before she called them back. Breathingnin the fresh air she didn't notice that Frank had come back and wasnstanding right next to her, she looked over and jumped back. \"Woah,nsecret agent much Frank, almost gave me a heart attack\" She saidnputting her hand on her chest. \"Sorrynbout that. Find everything all right?\" \"Yes,nand thank you for everything...including last night...but how did younknow\" \"Let'snjust say that your friend isn't exactly keen to keeping things tonhimself, after I left I heard him on the phone saying he was going tonwait for you, so like any gentleman, I hate to see a lady in trouble,nand here I am. Hisnstory didn't fly with her, but she accepted it. \"Whatnexactly where you doing at 2 in the morning walking by yourself?\" \"Myncar broke down, and it was my only way to get home\" \"Nonfriends?\" \"Don'tnhave any.\" \"Thatsnhard to believe, I would have given you a ride\" \"Youndon't know me, and I don't take rides from strangers\" \"Yetnyou let them save you\" \"WellnI was in need of saving, and like you said, what gentleman couldnpossibly pass that up\" She smiled and held out her hand. \"TerrinShaw, and who might I ask is my great rescuer?\" Frank gave her onenof those sarcastic smirk and put his hand in hers. \"FranknMartin\" Ohnthat voice. It could bring Terri to her knee's, that was if shenwasn't in control of the situation. Terrinhad that gift where she could tell instantly about people just by thenway they shake their hand. And she knew one thing for sure, FranknMartin, was not someone you want to mess around with. She let go ofnher hand and then leaned on the ledge looking over the Vally oncenagain, she could feel eyes on her. \"Seensomething you like?\" \"Notnreally, ok that came out wrong, I mean...hey...look at me\" Shenwas taken back and then turned to him, he walked closer to her,nrubbing his hands down her neck and collar bone, \"Your lucky I wasnthere\" \"Inguess\" She whispered. She looked up into his eyes. He brought anhand up to her cheek and caressed it with his thumb. She knew shenshouldn't let this happen, but she couldn't help it. It just seemednright. The ringing of a cell phone broke the trance. Terri closed herneyes, \"I have to get that\" Walkingnover to her purse, taking out the phone, reading the words Donny .nShe groaned and answered it. \"Hi...\" \"Terri,nwhere are you\" \"WellnHello Donald...Look something happened last night, ok?\" Franknexcused himself and walked back inside his house. He shut the doornletting her have some privacy. He walked over to the sink and gotnhimself come orange juice, he watched as she seemed to be having anvery intense conversation, which she wasn't enjoying. Letting out anfrustrated sigh she walked into the house. \"Badnconversation\" \"Horrible..um..Inwas wondering, you don't have to..but if I could get a ride...I meannif you have plans I understand I can get a ..\" She rambled again.nFrank stopped her. \"I'llngive you a ride\" \"Arenyou sure? I mean..\" \"It'snfine, when do we leave?\" \"Now,nwould be the best\" Franknnodded and let her grab her belongings. She followed him down anothernst of stair case's into what she thought was the basement. But itnwasn't, he pressed a lock code and the door opened to reveal hisngarage. 2 cars were in his Garage, one a BMW, not an American model,nprobably British and a Audi, A6 series. She nodded her head, \"Nice\" Franknwalked over to the BMW and unlocked it, \"Get in\" She walked overnand opened the door, getting inside buckling her seatbelt. Then theynwere off. \"So,nwhere am I taking you?\" \"Mynboyfriends house...just keep going straight, then after the next stopnlight turn left, and I will tell you the rest after that.\" Franknnodded and did was he was told. Terri put her elbow on the passengernside of the window and let her chin rest on her hand. Watching thenworld go by, she hardly notice that Frank asked her a question. \"I'mnsorry, what?\" \"Wherennow?\" \"Oh..njust stay on this road, you will come to a in fork in the road, takenthe left side and follow the road up the hill. Then just stay on it,nDonny's house is at the very top, you cant miss it.\" Afternfollowing her instruction, about 15 minutes later they were at thenhouse...or what Frank thought looked to be a compound. \"Waitnhere\" Terri said as she got out of the car and walked over to thensecurity gate. Frank watched as she talked to the security guard. Hengave her a phone and she reluctantly put it to her ear. She seemed tonbe yelling, after putting a hand to her head she nodded and then gaventhe phone back. She walked over to the drivers side of his car. Franknrolled down the window, \"Anything wrong?\" \"Donaldnwants to know if you can come inside...\" She eyes pleaded for himnto say yes. He looked past her and could see the guns the guard hadnhis hand safely resting on. \"Sure..whynnot\" \"Thanknyou...\" Terri walked over and got back into the car with Frank. Thenguard opened the gate to the house and Frank drove ahead, the guardnnever gazing away from Frank as he drove past. Making his way to thencircle driveway, Terri sucked in a breath and she saw 5 people walknout of the house. Putting the car in park, Frank and Terri got out.nTerri walked over to the man who he suspected was Donald. She wasnabout to walk past him, but Donald grabbed her wrist to stop her,npulled her close, whispered something to her ear, then let her go.nShe broke from his grip and then walked up the steps to the house,nbut not before looking back at Frank. Then went inside. Donald walkednover to Frank. His Italian accent looming the parking lot. \"DonaldnColetta, your Frank Martin I presume?\" Donald held out his hand.nFrank didn't hesitate for a minute before also offering his, shakingnit. He knew who Donald was, and he had no intention of causingnproblems. \"Thatsnright\" \"Well,nyour probably wondering why I called up up to my humble abode, walknwith me\" Franknwent into step with Donald as they walked up the steps to his house. \"Itncrossed my mind\" \"Wellnit's nothing really\" They walked into the house, \"I just wantednto meet the man that saved my Terri, please have a seat\" \"I'dnrather stand thank you\" Terrinwalked into the room holding a glass of wine and she set it down innfront of Donald, then sat next to him, Frank watched as Donald putnhis arm around Terri's back resting it there, lightly playing withnher shoulder. Frank could sense the tension she was feeling withnevery stroke of his touch. That to Frank was not a good sign. \"Mr.nMartin\" \"Frank\" \"Mynapologies, Frank, how do you know my lovely Terri\" \"Donaldnhe is a customer at the Grill\" Terri answered quickly. \"Shenis right, I go over to the Bar once in a while to meet with mynpartners\" \"Partner?nWhat business are you in? You were once a military man, were younnot?\" \"Thatnwas a long time ago, I'm a professional driver\" Donaldnsmiled and looked at Terri, she shook her head and looked away. \"Terri,nwould you excuse us? I would like to speak to Mr. Mar...Frank alone\" \"Donaldnno\" \"Terri,nI wont ask you again\" Shenstood up and walked out of the room shutting the doors. \"Inam sorry about her behavior, she doesn't like my way of living, well,nmore so what I do\" \"Indon't understand?\" \"Frank...Inknow who you are, I know all about what business you run, and I mustnsay I am extremely pleased with your work. Which is why I am in muchnneed of you're occupation, that is , if you will help me.\" Franknsat down across from him and took out a pen and paper. \"I'mnlistening\" Terrinsat outside, how dare Donald do this, how dare he meddle with hernlife, this wasn't part of the plan. The door opened and Terri stoodnup, Donald's number one man came over to her smirking, taking hernarm. \"Donaldnwants you to escort Mr. Martin back to his car, if you would be sonkind\" \"Letngo of my arm you slime\" She yanked it away and walked into thenroom. Donald and Frank were shaking hands. Donald spotted Terri andnwalked over to her, he stood facing the opposite direction in frontnof her, he kissed her neck, she looked away. \"Makensure Mr. Martin gets to his car safely pet\" He whispered to hernbefore he let go. Terrinnodded and then let Donald pass. Walking with Frank they went downnthe steps of the house and down to the driveway. Frank unlocked hisncar and stood next to it. \"Wellnyour here, I did my part, good day Frank\" \"Terrinwait...\" \"WhatnFrank...\" Frank noticed the tired look in her eyes. He walked overnand stood front of her.\"Frank don't..Donald...\" He took her handnand opened it up and placed a piece of paper in it. Then closed itnwith his other hand. Nodding, he then got into his car and drove outnof the complex. Terrin walked back inside. Making her way up the stairs she was stopped bynDonald. \"I'dnlike to thank you Terri, who knew that a stranger in the night couldnmake our plan go to the next level.\" He took her hand and held it,nrubbing his thumb over hers, \"If you let me..I could show you myngratitude\" She pulled away. \"Asshole\" Shenwhispered to him and then walked up the stairs to her room. Shuttingnand locking the door she went into the bathroom she had in the roomnand opened her hand, and looked at the note If you need me Andnhe gave her address and number. \"Thanksnfor trying Frank...\" She shook her head and lit a match, she wasnabout to set fire to the note then hesitated. Dropped the match innthe sink and crumbled the paper in a ball and threw it in thentrashcan. Chaptern2[Chapter 3] Disclaimer:nI Don't own anyone from Transporter. Oh I wish I did though. Anyway.nTerri and Bubba and anyone else not in the movies are mine. Ok? A/N:nThanks you for all the reviews! I didn't think anyone came to thisnsection anymore. It really makes me happy to know people are readingnthis, and I'm not feeding thin air. Chaptern3! Enjoy Frank leaned against his car waitingnfor Donald to come out of the house. He checked his watch, it was Tennam. Donald walked out of the house, holding Terri's hand, she had anbriefcase in the other hand. He watched her closely coming down thensteps. She was wearing a light blue dress, with flowers printed onnit, and sandals. Her hair was down and it the light breeze made hernlook more beautiful then the night before. He watched as she andnDonald made their way to him. \"You're on time, I like that\" \"I like things precise\" \"Right...well here it is\" Terri walked over and handed thenbriefcase to Frank, their hands met and she instantly pulled away andnwalked back to her place next to Donald. Issac, Donald's right handnman came down the stairs with an envelope. He handed it to Donald.nDonald handed it to Frank. \"20,000 now...you will receive thenrest when you get to your destination\" \"Right then\" \"Thats it. Have a nice day...Frank\"nDonald turned around and pulled Terri with him. Frank put the briefcase into his trunknand then went into his car. He put on his gloves and typed in hisnignition code. Pushing the button to change is license plate, he putnthe car into drive and he was off. Next day Donald and Terrinsat in the living room, the clock bell went off at 12 noon. Exactlynthen a call was made and Issac answered it. \"Yes...itndid...ok..thank you\" \"And?\" \"The package wasnreceived\" \"Told you thatnman was a genius, see Terri, good things to come to those who wait\" \"It's not rightnwhat you are doing...using him like this, you know if things go wrongnhe will go to jail!\" \"You've nevernhad a problem with this before? How many lives have you used Terri?nCare to enlighten us?\" Terri rolled herneyes and stood up. \"That's the pastnDonald. Now is that all Donald, I do have a job to go to\" \"Terri, why mustnyou work, I have enough to support you, you know this?\" \"I like the ideanof earning my keeps, thank you very much\" Donald stood upnalso and put a hand on Terri's cheek. She pushed him away and walkednto the garage, Donald followed close behind. \"What happenednto us Terri, we used to be so happy\" \"Use to meaningnpast tense, now if you will excuse me Donald. I have work to do\" Terri walked awaynfrom him and got into her car, driving away. \"Follow her\"nDonald told his guard, who nodded and complied. Terri drove downnthe road and looked in her rear view mirror, she smiled to herself,n\"Donny's boys\" she said out loud. \"Ok Donald, you cant trustnme, Frank isn't the only one who knows how to drive.\" 1 week later Frank sat on his couch sinking into the cushion. Rubbing his handsnover his head he sighed and looked up at the ceiling. It had been anlong week. \"Why do you do this to yourself Frank, you can stop anytime younwant, you have money, looks, what more is there to have?\" He saidnto himself. But there was something he didn't have, and his currentnJob and the grill was the only thing letting him near it. \"Forget it man, it's not like she is yours for the taking\" Anknock interrupted his current conversation with himself. He looked atnthe clock. It was almost midnight. Who the bloodynhell could that be Frank got up and walked over to the door, he looked out the curtainnand there, at his door, was the person he least expected. Unlockingnthe 3 locks he opened the door. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Well hello to you to Frank\" Terri walked in pushing past him. \"Might want to shut that...letting all the warm air out\" Frank put a hand to his head and shut the door, Terri took off hernjacket and placed it on the counter. \"Terri, what are you doing here..Donald...\" \"Donald thinks I'm at my nice warm apartment, your not the only onenwho has a few tricks up her sleeve, it's amazing what people will donfor money now a days.\" Terri walked over and sat on the couch.n\"This is when the host ask the guest if they would like a drink\" \"What are you doing her Terri...\" Terri put her head into her hands. \"Honestly...I came to see you...\" \"Why?\" \"You need to break the deal with Donald\" \"You came here to talk about your boyfriend? That's surprising...\" Terri stood up, \"Damn it Frank, he is setting you up! All thosenpackages you've been delivering. Have you watched the news at allnthis week. Tell me its not a tad bit strange that every drop off younhave made this past week has had a tragic end for it's occupier's.nHuh? Ring any bells. And if you go through with this last drop off,nyour going down. All evidence and you , off the map. He is settingnyou up\" \"How do you know this\" \"I over heard Donald on the phone two nights ago.\" \"So you tell me now?\" \"It was the only time I could! I've been watched all week! At thengrill, when I drive, when I go shopping, I'm lucky I got away with itntonight...\" Frank walked over to her, he as standing directly in front ofnher,\"Why are you helping me?\" \"I'm tired of just sitting on the sidelines while Donald does this\" \"No ...why are you REALLY doing this?\" Terri opened her mouth to answer but nothing came out. The ringingnbroke them out of their trance. Frank walked over and picked it up.nTerri walked into the kitchen and got herself a glass of scotch, alsonone for Frank \"No, wrong number\" Frank hung up the phone and walked to the kitchen. Terri restednagainst the counter, Frank was directly across from her, resting hisnback against the island he had in the middle of his kitchen. Shenhanded him a glass of scotch. \"Here's to...our good health\" She smiled and downed it. She put anhand to her mouth wiping it. Watched as Frank took the shot, his eyesnnever leaving hers. Suddenly both dropped their glasses, his hittingnthe table, her shattering to the floor. He grabbed her and pulled hernto him, lips covering hers. She wrapped her arms around his neck andnclosed the space between them. The kiss was hungry, passionate, as ifnthey had been holding it in begging to let it out. He pushed themnforward, making her back push against the counter, they broke apart.nBoth breathing hard. Frank smiled, Terri smiled. \"Well that was...\" Frank didn't get to even finish his sentence before Terri grabbed hisnhead and pulled him down for yet another searing and desperate kiss,nwhich he had no complaints for. He began to leave a trail of kissesndown her neck and collar bone, she leaned her head to the side fornmore access. She closed her eyes and moaned. Frank took one hand andnbrought her face to his again to kiss her. He took the other hand innhers and raised it above her head. They were leaning father on thencounter now. Frank suddenly stopped. And broke away turning away. \"God damn it!\" He cursed. \"What! Whats wrong?\" She said out of breath. \"We shouldn't be doing this...\" \"You think that NOW. For god sakes.\" \"Terri\" \"No , no more Terri, damn it Frank you wanted it as much as I did\" \"thats not the problem..\" \"Then what is! Damn it Frank, TELL ME.?\" \"Cause I care about you to damn much! There...satisfied?\" Terri stopped. \"Fuck it\" Frank walked over and grabbed Terri's head. They were so close theirnlips could touch, \"Your infuriating!\" He sneered before hencrushed his mouth to hers. She wrapped her arms around his neck, henlifted her off the ground and somehow they had made it up the stairsnto his bedroom. They had managed to get of her jacket and top, andnhis also. Carrying her in only a bra and jeans , was not his idea ofnforeplay. Dropping her to her feet , he slammed the door shut behindnhim, not breaking the kiss once. And behind those doors, lets justnsay they both decided to take their anger out on each other...in manyndifferent ways. The next morning \"I think I hurt you\" Terri laughed as she ran her fingers overnthe scratches now formed on Franks well ripped chest. If she couldnthink so to herself. Frank looked up from the pillow and laughed.nTaking her hands into his. His other hand was being used as a pillownfor Terri's head, well at least his Bicep was. \"I've suffered worse...\" He brought her hand to his mouth andnkissed it. \"I wont argue with that.\" They laid their in comfortable silence, until Frank broke it. \"Why do you let him do it?\" Him meaning Frank. \"Well you certainly know how to ruin pillow talk\" \"Terri...\" She was silent for a moment gathering her thoughts, \"...Honestly...nI don't know, Donald was wonderful when we first became an item,nthen...things changed.\" \"You found out what he did? The killings?\" \"At first it bothered me...then it turned me on...but one day anwoman came into my grill and was in mourning. Of hernhusband...someone who Donald killed. And it hit me...People werensuffering, because of what we were doing...\" \"and you couldn't live with it?\" \"I tried to...but it was eating me away...so I told him...his jobnor me. But Donald doesn't take orders from woman. So he didn'tndecide...he still does it...and he still has me...\" \" He doesn't have you...if he did you wouldn't be here\" \"As soon as I leave this house I'm his again...until I die Inguess...\" Frank brought his hand and put it under her chin and tilted her headnto face him. \"Not anymore\" He gently kissed her, she brought her hand to his face to meet thenkiss. When they broke apart, she decided to ask the questions. \"Why do you do it?\" \"Do what\" \"This...your job...the 'transporting' thing you do? What do you getnout of it?\" \"I Don't know anymore...\" \"Well thats a great reason\" \"What would you be doing, if you weren't delivering things fornpeople?\" \"i Don't know...probably what I tried to do in France...live lifenas a normal citizen?\" \"A citizen with a gazillion dollars\" \"What about you Terri, if this wasn't your life? What would you bendoing?\" She was about to answer when Frank/s cell phone began to ring. Terrinsucked in a breath. Frank undid his arm from under Terri and put onnsome sweat pants, walking over to the dresser he answered the phone.nTerri got out of bed and went to find her clothes, after picking themnup she walked into the bathroom. \" 'ello \" \"Now that woman who just walked in your bathroom, wouldn't happennto be Ms. Shaw would it?\" Frank's eyesninstantly narrowed and walked over to the window, lowering one of thenshades he tried to look outside to see who was watching them. He shutnthe blinds after having no success. \"Now tell me, Mr.nMartin, I thought we were friends...\" \"PartnersnMr. Coletta, business partners.\" \"Evennso...I didn't think it was a partners job to mess with ones property\" \"Terri'sna big girl, she can do what she bloody well please\" \"YounBritish, such language. But that's not why I was calling, I need younto do another job, just one more\" \"Andnif I don't?\" \"Wellnthen lets just say as soon as Ms. Shaw walks out the bathroom door,nshe wont be anyones property, nor will she be alive.\" Franknlooked at the door as the knob as it turned. \"What'snit going to be Frank\" Donald pushed. Thendoor opened and Terri stood there, looking questionably at Frank. \"Suchna beautiful woman isn't she Mr. Martin, I'm not surprised you fellnfor her, everyone does. But in any case, what is it going to be...thenjob, or her life, you have 5 seconds to make a decision. 5...4...\" Franknhad to do it, he couldn't risk her life. He knew it was wrong, but itnwas better then her dying. \"...3...\" \"Franknwhats going on?\" Terri questioned. Terrinwas about to walk out when he put a hand up to stop her. Donaldncontinued. \"..2...\" \"I'mnlistening\" \"Wellndone Mr. Martin...well done indeed\" WHOOOnCHAPTER 3! yeahnits late again. Inhope you all enjoy it.[Chapter 4] \"We have a deal then? Am I correctnMr. Martin\" \"Frank, again, what is going on, whonare you talking to!\" Frank closed his eyes clutching thenphone in his hand. \"We have a deal\" \"Wonderful, I will see you soon, asnwell as Ms. Shaw\" \"You'll never get away with thisnColetta\" \"Oh, but Mr. Martin, I always have\" click The phone wentndead. Frank yelled and threw it across the room. He put one hand onnthe wall to steady himself. He was so mad he could burst with anger.nTerri ran over and put one hand on his face, trying to make him looknat her, he couldn't, not after what he just did. \"Frank...whatsnwrong...Frank...your scaring me\" Frank looked intonher eyes...they were filled with such worry, for him. He sighed andnput his arms around her drawing her closes. He had one arm wrappednaround her back and the other around her head. His face rested in thencrook of her neck. She did wrapped her arms around him to. \"Baby...who wasnthat?\" She was scared to know. He mumbled into her neck, shendidn't understand what he said, \"Speak again?\" Frank brought henface up to look at her again. \"It was Coletta\" A different fearnwas now plastered in Terri's eyes. She backed away from him. Shakingnher head. \"You...took thenjob...didn't you...\" \"Terri...\" \"Afterneverything...everything I told you...you...you used me...how couldnyou do this to me Frank?\" \"Terri, if younwould let me explain\" \"Oh..I thinknyou've explained yourself enough\" Terri ran out ofnthe room down the stairs. \"Damnnit...TERRI COME BACK!\" He yelled after her. But it was to late,nshe was already out the door and driving away in her car. Franknslammed his front door shut. \"FUCK!\" He looked at hisnwatch. He had four hours to think of someway to take down Coletta. Henran to his phone in the kitchen and dialed the only person who couldnhelp him. He waited impatiently for the person to answer. The personnanswered on the the 5th ring, French accent looming. \"Monsieur Franknyou do realize there is a 9 hour time difference between you andnmyself\" \"Am Ininterrupting?\" \"Nonsense,nalways time for you, Frank, to what do I owe this pleasure?\" \"Whatnconnections do you have to the feds in Los Angeles\" \"Ahnyes...always pleasure with you Frank\" \"You expectednsomething else?\" \"No. How muchntime?\" \"I have a 4 hournwindow\" \"Thats a lot ofncalls in such a short amount of time\" \"Well then Inguess I'm glad I'm not interrupting anything aren't I\" Franknsmiled. \"I suppose, now,nenlighten me, what is it this time\" Frank walked downnthe stairs to a secret door at the bottom of his stairs. Punching innthe code he waited for it to open. \"Oh you know,nsame old, same old?\" \"That bad?\" \"You have nonidea\" With that the doornopened and it showed a large room, full of guns and ammo. \"Anything youncant handle?\" \"No, but Inwouldn't mind some extra help\" \"What do I getnout of this?\" \"My deep andnundefined gratitude\" \"Ah..same oldnFrank\" Frank pulled out anBeretta and opened up to check the magazine to make sure it was full.nAfter checking he pushed it back into the handle and put it in hisnback of the jeans. \"Same oldnTarconi\" \"Well I supposenI could make a few calls...What do you plan on doing?\" \"Me...lets justnsay I have some apologies to make\" \"Ah yes...anwoman. I understand, good luck\" \"thank you\" \"Anytime, justnsend the information and Ill do what I can\" \"It's sent\" \"Wellnthen...good day Frank\" Frank shut off thenphone and grabbed a bag down and started to fill it with guns andnammo. Hoping that it would be enough. At Coletta's \"My dear Terrinwhy did you even presume to think I had no idea where you were going,nI must say though...that decoy girl...what a good job that was. Inbelieved it...up until the moment she was killed\" Terri was in anchair, hands and feet tied together. She suck in a breath, \"Younbastard\" \"My dear...suchnharsh words for some a young woman, it's to bad you couldn't handlenmy lifestyle...you would've made a beautiful wife\" He said leaningntoward her, his face barely touching hers. \"I nevernwould've married you, sooner or later I would've became this way, I'mnglad it happened quickly\" \"Ah yes...Inremember, you like your men...British\" He pulled her facento his and kissed her. She struggled to get away from him, but it wasnno success, seeing as she was tied to a chair. After he let go shenshriek. She then looked at him angry and spit at his face. \"Younwill never be anything like him\" Donald stood back and laughed,ntaking out a handkerchief and wiping off his face. Then he took anpunch to her face. Then wiped his knuckle off. \"It's a shame hentook the job, even after knowing what will happen to him, we could'venhad so much more use for him. Unfortunately after today their will benno more Frank Martin\" \"What are yountalking about\" Terri sneered. Donald looked at her questionablynthen smiled, Terri continued. \"He has no idea what is going tonhappen, he is just doing this for the money\" \"My pet yournwrong...\" He put a hand on her face, \"He knows exactly what he isndoing...I told him on the phone this morning, in fact the only reasonnhe is doing this is or you, I made him choose, this job...or yournlife\" Terri turned awaynand closed her eyes, not believing what she was hearing. Frank hadngiven his life to save hers. It all made sense now, Donald must'venhad a sniper at Frank's, knowing that Frank would never let harm comento her, he agreed. Wow did she feel like shit right about now. \"Aw hats wrongnpumpkin...frank not mention that to you?\" \"Shut up\" Issac walked intonthe room and handed the phone to Donald. \"yes...uhnhuh...thank you\" \"He isnhere...take her\" Donald walked outnof the house to where Frank had pulled up his car. Frank got out andnstood next to the drivers side taking off his gloves. Frank lookednacross the parking lot to see a black van pull up, 2 men getting outnfrom the back. Holding the doors open. Donald click hisnfingers and two guards came and started to pat down Frank. \"What the hell?\" \"Just anprecaution Frank, cant have you armed\" Frank sighed. \"He is clean\" \"You expectedndifferent Coletta\" \"I never knownwhat to expect with you Mr. Martin , now do I\" Frank looked overnhis shoulder to see Teri being hauled into the van. Terri saw him andnbegan to struggle, her could barely hear his name through the tapenshe had over her mouth. Frank was about to make a dash to her but thentwo men in in front stopped him. Donald waved a finger in front ofnhis face. \"Now now, nonenof that\" \"Bastard younsaid you wouldn't hurt her\" \"I said shenwould be safe, when I know the deal is complete, correct\" Donald steppednforward, shoving the guards away. Issac handed an envelope to Donaldnwho then gave it to Frank. \"You will keepnthe envelope closed until you go down the mountain. Then you willnopen it and follow it's instructions\" \"This wasn'tnpart of the deal\" \"Lets callnit...how is it said...oh yes...a twist, to our deal\" Frank grabbed thenenvelope and walked to his car, he got in, but not before hearingnDonald's warning. \"If things gonwrong...she's dead\" Frank got in thendrivers side and started the car. Driving away from the house. Oncengetting down the mountain he pulled out the papers in the envelope.nIt was instructions to where the package was, after reading themnover, Frank put the papers back into the envelope and drove to thendestination. He hoped that the inspector would once again come innhandy and help him. It was all he had. Once getting to thendestination he turned the car off and waited. Thats when he saw it. Ancar pulled up across from him. He looked at who got out and he didn'tnwant to believe it. \"No...\" And there she was,nas beautiful as ever, she had on a red gown that made her sparklenwith the sunset. But why was she dressed up. She walked over to thenpassenger side door, he unlocked it and she got in. Slamming it shut. \"Whats going onnTerri? Where's the package\" \"I'm sorrynFrank...it's me...I'm the package\" She opened hernhands to reveal a small vile. Frank cursed and gripped his steeringnwheel. \"Thatnbastard...\"[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I don't own Transporternor anything of it. I wish I owned Jason. Yum. Terri and anyone elsennot Transporter is though! A/N: Chapter 5! YAY! \"Frank...say something?\" It had been an hour since he had pickednup the 'package' Frank how not said a word to Terri the entire ride.nHe had no idea what was going on, but all he knew is that Donaldnwould pay, but right now he had to think of how to get Terri out ofnthis mess. \"Why are you all dressed up?\" \"Donald told me I had to attend anparty, but I Don't think it's jump some party Frank...something badnis going to happen\" \"Did he give you anything to givenme?\" \"Yes...\" Terri reached into her purse and pullednout a small disk. She handed it over to Frank, he took it with hisnfree hand and inspected it, still keeping an eye on the road thennthen gave it back to her. \"What is it Frank?\" \"I Don't know...did he tell younanything?\" \"Only that as soon as we arrive I amnsuppose to meet with Issac. Who is meeting us wherever we arenheading...where are we heading?\" Frank handed her the envelope. Terrinopened it up and looked at the address and got wide eyed. \"This cant be right...no no...thisnis not right at all\" \"What? What isn't right\" \"The Harding House...this cant be thenright address, Donald isn't this narrow minded\" \"He tied you up and stuffed you in anvan...\" \"Be quiet. No, the Harding House,nit's a piece of estate owned by the Governors son Phillip. And whennyou think top security this is it. No one is allowed in or outnwithout special permission. Wait a minute...\" She went back to hernpurse and pulled out a small envelope and pulled out what was inside,ntwo tickets. \"What is it?\" \"Tickets...to Phillips engagement.nDamn it, where did he find these...\" \"Wait, you knew about this?\" \"In a sense...Phillip is my halfnbrother...same father...different mothers, he invited me to hisnengagement to his girlfriend of 3 years...\" \"Wait...Your the governors daughter!\" \"Don't make a deal please! I would'ventold you sometime...\" \"Never mind...why would Donald try tonsabotage your brother?\" \"It has to for money. If my fathernand brother dies all of the estate and power goes to me. Daddy nevernapproved of Donald, which was a reason I tried to end it...but younknow Donald. But beside the point...I cant believe this...he isntrying to kill my family...\" Terri wiped a tear that had fallen downnher cheek. Frank sighed, \"Terri, let me promise you...no one, younor your family is going to die tonight...\" \"Don't make promises you cant keep\" \"Rule number 4 Terri, I never do\" Frank took her hand and pulled it tonhis lips squeezing it, trying to give her some hope that he wouldnsucceed in this. \"Frank you better have a plan\" \"Let's just say the I havenconnections\" \"We can only hope\" Frank pulled into the driveway of thenestate. They pulled up to the gate and a man knocked on their window. \"Name?\" \"Frank Martin and Terri Shaw\" The man looked over the list and madentwo checks and nodded to the other man at the gate. He pushed anbutton and it opened up. \"Enjoy your night\" Frank nodded and rolled his window up.nTerri hugged herself, she had a bad feeling about this. Driving up tonthe space to park he turned off the ignition. They both got out ofnthe car, Frank walked to the trunk and opened it, revealing a smallnbag. He opened to check that everything was in their, which consistednof many types of weapons. \"Give me the bag...\" \"Why?\" \"You'll never make it pastnsecurity...I can\" \"I guess your the expert\" Frank got the bag out and handed it tonher, she nodded and was about to start walking toward the house, whennsuddenly Frank grabbed her wrist and pulled her back to him. Pushingnher against the car he kissed her passionately. When they broke apartn, they both smiled. \"Frank...about this morning\" \"Don't, it's fine, I was never mad\" Terri dropped the bag and hugged him,nFrank didn't care about anything right now...he had Terri again andnthat was all that mattered, but for how long? Could they make it?nFrank grabbed her hand and she took the bag, they walked to thenhouse. \"Ms. Shaw, how wonderful to see you\"nThe greeter at the door said smiling. Terri smiled back, and huggednthe old man. \"Hello Tony, it's wonderful to benback home as well, I'd like you to meet my friend...Frank Martin\"nFrank held out his hand and shook Tony's \"Pleasure Tony\" \"The pleasure is all mine, it'snwonderful to see a smile back on Terri's face\" Terri blushed and hide in Franksnshoulder, she could hear Franks laughter. They excused themselves andnwalked into the house. It was huge...Frank was astonished by itsnsize. Terri found a open closet and threw the bag in there. Then shendirected him to the ball room. Frank held her hand and escorted hernthough the doors. As they entered a voice rang out. \"Terri! Terri is that you!\" Terrinlooked up to the voice that was calling her name, she looked throughnthe crowd to see Phillip rushing toward her. Terri smiled and let gonof Franks hand running toward him. \"Phillip!\" She flung her armsnaround him hugging him. He laughed and spun her around. \"My baby sister...look at you...younlook fantastic, your beaming!\" Phillip handed Terri some champagne. Henclicked it with hers before taking a drink. \"Do i really look changed? It hasn'tnbeen that long\" \"Terri, 7 months is a long time\" \"I guess...so where is Susan?\" \"Susan had to catch a plane to Milannfor business, but she said not to cancel the party, never likednwasted money. But anyway, how are things with Donald?\" \"Donald is no longer with her\" Frank said walking up to the two.nPhillip looked at Terri, then to Frank. \"And you are?\" \"Frank Martin\" Frank held out hisnhand. Phillip hesitated for a moment, Terri didn't catch it but Frankndid, not dropping his hand or gaze Frank waited patiently. Phillipnthem met his gaze smiled and shook his hand. \"Welcome Mr. Martin, tell me...how donyou know my sister?\" \"Phillip, this isn't the place\" \"Aw, come on sis, obviously somenthing has happened, I would love to hear about it?\" \"Hear about what?\" Terri turned to see her father standingnbehind her. She smiled and hugged him. \"Woah...princess, I'm happy to seenyou to...now hear about what?\" \"Mr. Martin was just about to tellnthe story...\" \"..of how I saved Terri's like onennight after work. She was attacked and I happened to be in the areanand I saved her life\" Frank interrupted. \"My gos..sweet ms is this true?\" \"Dad it was nothing, but I wasnthankful Frank was there...\" \"Well then...\" Her father walkednover and shook Franks hand, \"Any man who saved my babies life is anwelcome man in my home\" Frank smirked and shook his hand also.nTerri smiled...he had gained respect with her father. :Thank you Mr. Governor\" \"Please...please...call me Albert, Inwasn't born governor\" \"My mistake Albert\" \"Now...who wants a drink?\" Albert walked in front and took Terri'snhand , Terri gave her drink to Frank and smiled leaving him withnPhillip. \"So...Mr. Martin. What are yournintentions with my sister\" He asked taking a sip. \"I believe that is our business, ifnyou Don t mind\" \"Actually\" Phillip set his glass onnthe table, then walked behind Frank, Frank felt something push intonhim, it was a gun. Phillip whispered to him, \"I need to know yournexact intentions. See, my sister is here for a certain reason...one Incant have ruined. Do we have a deal?\" Terri was now walking backnwith her father smiling, she looked so happy. Frank gritted hisnteeth. \"We have a deal, now let me go\" \"Pleasure\" Frank coughed to make a small scene,ncausing Phillip to pull away from him. Frank continued to cough andnwent to the table resting against it, then scribbled something on onnthe napkin he hand used to cover his mouth with. Concerned Terrinwalked back over and took her place next to Frank. She wrapped onenarm around Frank and squeezed him, \"You ok?\" Frank put his armnaround her. \"I'm fine\" He said. \"Ok\" She said. Phillip walked overnto his sister. \"Might I steal him away for a minute,nyou have someone that wanted to speak with you, an Issac?\" Franks arms tightened around Terri'snwaist, he didn't want to let her go, he didn't even want her here,nsomething was going on and her brother was in on it. Terri didn'tnwant to go either but she had to, she knew the kind of man Donaldnwas, in her own home or not, he still could try anything. So shenagreed. Before Frank let her go he slipped the napkin into her hand,nshe made sure no one was watching as she slipped it underneath thendress. Walking away she left Frank alone with Phillip and Albert. \"So Frank, my daughter tells me younare a professional driver..what for?\" \"People need things delivered, Indeliver them, I'm actually thinking of changing careers, sometimes itnwill do someone well, Don t you agree?\" \"Brains and brawns, I like you Frank,nI like you a lot. Hopefully this wont be the last time we see eachnother, tell that daughter of mine your welcome anytime.\" \"I will do that sir, and thank you\" Phillip drank his drink, anger gleamingnfrom his eyes. Then something changed, Frank noticed his eyes hadnreverted to what was behind him. Frank looked up causally at thenceiling, the mirror there showed 3 men walking into the room Terrinhad just gone into, and they were carrying a large container. Franknwas pretty sure that was more cocktails. \"Will you excuse me? I have somenpeople I need to say hello to, Frank...Father\" \"Nice meeting you Phillip\" Franknsneered, in a tone only Phillip could pick up. \"You to Frank\" Phillip excused himself. Frank needednto get into that room, but before anything, he stopped, he saw Donaldnwalk into the room that Phillip entered, the same room Terri was in.nThis wasn't good, Frank made his way over excusing himself fromnAlbert when suddenly the lights went black. Screaming filled thenballroom. Frank stopped and braced himself for whatever was coming.nThen a shot rang out, more screaming, there was no way more Frank tonget out of their now. When the lights went back on security hadnalready made its way through telling everyone to calm down. Thatsnwhen Frank took in a breath. At his feet was Albert Harding, lyingnin a pool of blood. Frank knew this couldn't have looked good. Terri,nPhillip, and Donald all ran into the ballroom. Terri screamed and rannto her father on the floor, cradling his head in her hands. Sobbing.nPhillip screamed, \"Arrest that man\" Pointing to Frank. \"I didn't do anything!\" Security grabbed him before he couldnmove and search him, they pulled out a 9mm, they opened the mag tonsee 1 shot missing, they pushed it up and then took their handcuffsnout and cuffed him. \"Terri I didn't do this! You have tonbelieve me!\" Terri looked up, tears glistening downnher face. She walked up to Frank and stood in front of him. \"Terri...\" Then she slapped him, slapped him sonhard it echoed in the building. She thinks I did it He thought. He couldn't look at her. Security escorted him out of thenballroom. \"Take him to thencell in the basement, we Don t want him going anywhere...\" Phillipnsaid smiling as he looked as his sister. She wiped her eyes andnwalked away. Their father was dead and Frank was deemed guilty of it. Things are going accordingly to plan Phillip smiled to himself. CHAPTER 5! WHOOOO Review?[Chapter 6] Disclaimer:I don't own anythingnTransporter, I wish...I own Terri though and anyone else A/N: Chapter 6! OMG ITS GETTING SOnSUSPENSFUL! Yeah...but I love writing it. Enjoy! Review? Terri walked out of the ballroom andnthen ran. Ran as fast as her heels could take her, she needed to getnto the basement. Later... It had been 1 hour since Frank had beennarrested. He was tossed in some tiny cell that Phillip had on thengrounds. If he could get out of the cell he could take the 3 guardsnhe had out easily and silent, but things just had to be difficult. \"Comfortable?\" One of guards asked. \"Fantastic...would you mind notnspeaking to me, your voice is causing my brain to loose cells\" The two other guards laughed at theirncaptain when Frank had told him off. The captain walked over tonFrank's cell. \"You better watch your mouth...yournalready in deep shit, and my boss has got some nice things plannednfor you\" \"And I got some for you Michael...\"nMichael turned around to see Terri leaning against the door, the facenaching with seduction. Frank's eyes got wide what is she doingnhere! \"Uh...Ms.nShaw...your not suppose to be down here...\" Terri walked overnto him. Swinging her hips, the other guards eyes eyed with hunger. \"Is it mynbrother...don't let him intimidate you, i don t...besides...\" Shenwas now standing directly in front of him. guard number 2 and 3 werenon each of her sides. Not directly next to her but a few feet away.nShe smiled and leaned up to Michaels ear, staring directly intonfranks eyes, \"...you just as big and bad as he is...don't you trustnme on that\" Michael nodded, \"Well...you shouldn't\" She head buttednMichael, then kneed him in the gut, while raising the chair next tonher and throwing it at the guard on her left. Causing him to fallnover against the wall, injured. Guard number 3 then grabbed his gunnand got it out, but not quick enough. She grabbed the arm that hadnthe gun and twisted it around, punching him in the face, knocking himnout cold. \"Terri behindnyou!\" Frank yelled. She turned aroundnand there was guard number two, no gun but a knife. She took hernstance smiling. Then motioned for him to approach her. He lunged fornher she blocked his move and knocked him to the ground. He took thenknife and raise it up under her dress splitting it down the side. Shendid a full 360 trying to not get cut. She looked down at her dressnand smiled. \"Thanks\" Shenran forward and kicked him in the face, heels piecing his neck. Henfell backwards, holding his neck. She then brought out a silencernfrom her holster that was underneath her dress and walked over , shotnhim in the head, and the same for the other guards. Walking over tonthe keys on the shelf she picked up the one to Franks cell, when shengot there she opened it. Told Frank to turn around and unlocked thenkeys to the cuffs. When he faced her again she immediately wrappednher arms around him. Then brought her hand to his face, \"I had tondo it...it was the only way to get out out of their...I gout yournnote and you were right, Phillip has gone crazy, he and Donald both,nFrank I'm so sorry\" She hid her face in his chest. Frank justnrubbed her back and kissed her forehead. Looking at the scene innfront of him. Terri looked up and around, \"We don't have much timencome on\" She handed Frank the gun and then brought the other shenhad out of her other leg holster. \"Who are you?\" They walked up thenstairs and into a deserted hallway, Terri ignored him, Frank gotnupset and grabbed her arm and pushed her against the wall. \"I asked you anquestion, what the Fuck is going on Terri\" \"Alright...Mynname is Theresa, or Terri for short. I'm undercover agent for thenCIA\" \"So you lied tonme\" \"No I didn't liento you Frank, everything you know about me is the truth, Albertnis..or was my father, I found out about him when I was 19 years old,nI was already working for the CIA then. After meeting my father itnwas like i was the daughter he always wanted, Phillip has always beennjealous. When my father suspected that his new client Donald wasntrying to set him up, the CIA sent me in. I didn't realize I would gonso far though\" \"How long havenyou been doing this?\" \"Ive beennundercover for 6 years...Frank I have never lied to you\" \"I know...butnright now...we have to talk about this later because you need tonduck...\" \"What?\" \"DUCK\" Frank pushed Terrinaway and stopped the club the guard was about to hit her with. Henused the club to bring him closer and then broke his grip on it.nFrank flipped the club over to the handle side and then smack thenguard across the face with it. \"Holy shit! Indidn't even hear him\" \"Your lucky I sawnhim\" \"We gotta gonFrank...there is a bomb in this building, and if we don't findnit...it wont be good\" Frank nodded andnthey both ran down the hallway. Terri turned the corner and found thenelevator. They pushed the button to go to the main level. \"How big is thisnplace?\" \"Big enough tonexplode and make it look like a terrorist attack that you did\" \"What exactly isngoing on?\" \"Before my fathernwas killed, he signed over a new will last year, leaving everythingnto me. Phillip was upset and thats when he turned to Donaldnapparently\" \"If your fathernand you are dead then he gets the money for it. And since he cantnshoot you like he did his father he plans to just blow you up. AndnI'm the scapegoat.\" \"Exactly\" The elevator dingedn and the door opened. Frank made sure it was clear and told her tonfollow him. When they reached the room that Phillip and Donald werenin she stopped him. Told him to wait while she got the guards out. She stood in frontnof the doors and ruffled her hair, ripped more of her skirt, then shenopened the door and ran into the room. \"Donald, henescaped! He tried to strangle me! He had a gun and he shot thenguards...Donald he is free!\" Donald's eyes got wide. \"Guards! Searchnthe grounds, I want that man back here!\" They nodded and rannout the door. Frank wait for the door to close before he shot themnall, using the silencer. Donald walked over to Terri and put his handnon her face. \"No one willntouch you again\" \"Take your handnoff her\" Donald froze andnput his hand up. Frank had walked into the room and had his gun tonDonald's head. Phillip was about to grab his when Terri grab hers andnpointed it at him. \"Oh no Dearnbrother, I'm afraid the rules are going to take a turn for the worstnfor you. How dare you, humiliate me and the family with yournexcursions and then you do this\" \"You don't knownwhat you are talking about\" \"Oh yeah...Whyndon't you call Susan...Wait you cant...her body was found a month agonin the river outside New York, nice job though.\" Frank pushed Donaldnforward to Phillip. \"I mean you gotnDonald to burn off her prints and then removed her teeth, what didnshe do huh? Find someone better, were the drugs not what she wantednfrom you\" \"Shut up!\" \"No. you FUCKINGnSHUT UP. You killed our father you sick bastard, because ofnmoney..all because of fucking money. You could've had it all\" \"Shut up younwhore. Your just like your mother. Aw daddy sure loved her, that onennight in heaven brought you into our little world. Daddy's princess.nAnd the pain in the ass to the rest of us. Do you know what it wasnlike, to have your own mother leave you when you are 7 because yournfather was unfaithful and had a child with another woman. Only tonhave that child grow up and become his favorite\" \"He loved you\" \"Not like you,nyou were everything he ever wanted, I was his name\" All of a suddennTerri felt pressure against her back. \"Ah Issac nice ofnyou to join us\" Donald said as Frank turned to see Issac holdingnTerri with a gun to her back. \"Drop it\" hensaid. Terri dropped her gun, \"You to\" He said to Frank. Frank didnthe same also. \"Well looks likenthe tables have turned\" Phillip opened the crate to reveal a bomb.nHe set the timer for 15 min. Make sure it didn't go off to soon.nPhillip wanted to get away. Terri looked overnat Frank, she had her hands raised. He nodded to her, she noddednback. Suddenly she elbowed Issac in the solar p lex. Then grabbed hisnarm with the gun and banged it against her knee making it drop. Thennshe flipped him over. Frank then grabbed the gun he placed down andnshot at the now running Donald and Phillip. He got Phillip in thenleg, but Donald escaped through the door. Terri stood up withnher gun in her hand, she kicked Issac and told him to stand, he didnand raised his hands, \"Please...I've always liked you\" \"You know, Inthink I want you to kneel\" She shot him in the leg. Then shenpressed her heel into the wound. He screamed. She shot him in thenhead, death coming quickly. \"TERRI!We got tongo\" Frank screamed to her. She ran over and was almost to the door,nhe was right after her, then it happened. She heard a shot and thenncovered herself. She wasn't bleeding then she looked at Frank, whonwas kneeling on the ground screaming, holding his shoulder, he wasnshot. Phillip had a gun in his hand. She was about to run over butnFrank looked up holding his wound. \"GO!\" \"I'm not leavingnyou!\" \"Damn it Terri!nGo!\" Swallowing thentears she turned running past the bullets. She made her way tot henoutside and ran into the arms of a police officer. She lookednaround...there were hundreds of agents there, but she never made ancall. She then focused on the police officer in front of her. \"Officer inside!nThere is a man injured\" \"I'm sorry wenneed to come over here, there was a bomb threat and we need to clearnthe grounds...\" \"NO...THERE IS AnMAN, HE NEEDS YOUR HELP!\" \"Terri!\" Terrinlooked over to see Tony. She ran over and he hugged her, \"Where'snFrank?\" She pointed to thenhouse. Tony held her close. Inside \"You know Inalways though about my Sisters taste in men. She never was a greatnpicker\" \"You seemed tonlike Donald\" \"He was anbusiness deal, nothing more, nothing less\" Phillip kickednFrank in the stomach. \"Why don't younfight like a real man?\" \"Like you?\"nFrank said holding his stomach. \"How much morenman to you possibly need? Now if you would be so kind and die!\" He was about tonshoot frank when Frank grabbed a knife from his ankle and stabbednPhillip in the leg. Phillip screamed, already having one leg with anbullet, now the other with a gun, it must've been painful. Standingnup Frank looked at Phillip. Frank spit blood on the floor then wipednhis mouth. Taking in this pathetic scene. He then leaned over Phillipnand put his head in his hands. Leaning his face so close, henwhispered, \"You wanted to make me upset and fight, well you got it,nbut you, are NOTHING\" He set him up so that Phillip was kneeling,nfacing the same way Frank was, with his back to him. Frank spunnaround and the kicked him. Causing Phillips neck to break, slumpingnover dead. Frank straightenednhis coat and then looked at the bomb ...1:00...59...58...57 \"SHIT!\" Hendashed out of the room. Outside \"InNEED TO HELP HIM. SOMEBODY GO AND HELP HIM\" Terri screamed. Tonynhad her in her arms as she struggled to break free. She shoved Tonynaway and made a dash for the house, another officer was already onnher tail, and thats when it happened. The entire house blew up into a giant ball of fire into the night.nThe officer grabbed Terri , threw her to the ground covering her bodynwith his, while her screaming. The officer yelled for her to stayndown. The fire department showed up and ran to the house. Terrinpushed the officer off of her and stood on her feet. She ran herndirty hands through her hair and screamed, then began sobbing,nreaching for the house she walked, Tony ran up to her and stopped hernhugging her. She screamed and sobbed. Yelling his name into thennight. Tony wrapped his arm around her back and neck, trying to calmnher down...she sunk to the ground. \"Frank...\" She sobbed. HAHAHAHAHAHHA. O dang.

Muireann intercepted the ball, casually hopping it from one knee to the other. \"Well me da' says if they try any o' that 'round here, he'll shove his harpoon up their-\" \"Yer da' is full of shite, Muireann!\" Muireann responded by aiming the ball directly as Aisling's face, pouring all her fury into the kick. \"OI!\" Aisling yelled, barely ducking as the projectile went shooting over her head with all the speed and force of a cannonball. \"TAKE THAT BACK!\" Muireann bellowed, stomping right up to her friend. \"Shan't!\" Aisling pouted. \"Yer da' is a drunken liar.\" Muireann balled her fists. \"You take that back or-\" Something like thunder seemed to rumble from deep below, causing the sand to vibrate beneath their feet. \"What was that...\" Aisling asked. \"I dinne know... maybe...\" Muireann spoke glancing around before falling dead silent. Far out in the bay, the dark grey waters churned. An eldritch greenish-blue glow, like the eye of some massive serpent, seemed to move just below the waves before sinking back into the depths. The three girls huddled in dazed silence for a long moment, eyes agog. \"M-Maybe we should go home?\" Coibhe finally piped up, shyly. \"Yeah...\" Muireann whispered. \"Wait... What about me ball?\" \"You kicked it away, you go get it!\" Aisling snipped. \"Fine!\" Muireann huffed as she began clambering over the granite rocks that marked the beach's sandy borders. She hopped from one boulder to the other while muttering a hushed prayer. \"Oh, Saint Anthony, please help me find me ball and I promise not to cuss at Aisling... as much.\" She stopped short, noticing the ball floating on the placid waters. Her eyes rolled Heavenwards. \"Very funny,\" she grumbled before kicking off her shoes and cannonballing into the sea. The cold waters numbed her skin as the salt stung her eyes. As they adjusted to the gloom, she noticed something made her forget completely about her ball. Before her, loomed a great stone frame, at least ten feet high from threshold to lintel. From somewhere deep within, a pale blue light shimmered enticingly. She swam back up to the surface, drinking in the cool air. It would be stupid to go poking about some underwater magic cave, the very height of inane foolhardiness... She sucked in enough air to burst her lungs... and dived. [-] \"It's been a while,\" Coibhe muttered as she drew horses in the sand. \"Maybe we should go look fer her?\" \"She's fine,\" Aisling snipped, skipping stones along the water's surface. \"I say we give her five minutes then-\" A piercing scream erupted from somewhere beyond the granite rocks, only to be drowned out by a bestial howl. Aisling and Coibhe broke into a panicked dash, fleeing the empty beach as rain began drizzling from the grey sky. [-] Whitmore Manor, Washington D.C. Queen Kidagakash Nedakh of Atlantis sat alone by the bedroom window, staring out as raindrops pattered against the glass like a thousand bored drumming fingers. Water did not fall from above in the world she knew. The first time she beheld rain, shortly after being stranded on the surface world, she had thought the sky itself had cracked open. It had seemed both a terror and a wonder at the time. Now… she barely noticed it. Knock knock. \"Enter.\" \"Hey, Kida,\" Milo Thatch poked his head in the door. \"Dinner'll be ready in about half an hour. Cookie's making his famous One-Pepper-Seven-Pots of Chili! At least, he says it's chili.\" \"I'm not hungry.\" \"Me neither,\" Milo admitted, sitting himself down beside her. \"I was actually hoping we could hide in the closet until he loses interest and moves on?\" Kida smiled weakly, she couldn't help but appreciate her consort's sense of humor even at the worst of times. \"Is this about what happened in Paris?\" Milo asked, extending an arm. Kida leaned into him, allowing her head to sink into his shoulder as he wrapped his arm around her. \"My people created the Praying Gargoyle to save lives, to protect those who could not protect themselves… yet the Gorlois almost turned it into a weapon of mass murder.\" \"Yeah, but we stopped her and destroyed the Praying Gargoyle. That thing is never falling into the wrong talons again!\" \"That's not the point, Milo. We may have stopped the Gorlois from destroying humanity, and Erik Hellstrom from bringing about Ragnarok, but this world is filled with fanatics just as bad; if not worse. If another lost Atlantean weapon were to fall into the wrong hands…\" \"Kida,\" Milo spoke softly, drawing her closer. \"You're not guilty of the crimes others commit using Atlantean technology.\" \"No… but I am responsible.\" They sat in silence until… Knock knock. \"Hey, You two lovebirds decent in there?\" the muffled voice of Vincenzo 'Vinny' Santorini spoke from the hall. \"Yes, Vinny,\" Milo sighed. \"'Cuz I can come back later if you're… you know…\" \"It's fine, Vinny.\" \"Uh… Exploring the depths of Atlantis, playing with your dynamite, doing the Leviathan with two-\" \"VINNY!\" \"Anyway, boss man wants to see you downstairs when you're done but… like… don't rush yourselves, okay?\" \"Thanks, Vinny,\" Milo answered icily, as Kida shook with barely contained laughter. [-] Vinny sat at the long dining table, tinkering absently with a tangle of wires. Beside him sat Audrey Ramirez, Team Atlantis' resident mechanic, leaning back on her chair as she chewed a piece of gum. While across, sat the chiseled form of Dr. Joshua Sweet. All the while, Obby the lava-dog snoozed contentedly in the roaring fireplace. \"Vincenzo, now what have I told you about playing with explosives at the dinner table?\" Dr. Sweet scolded playfully. \"Technically, it's just the detonator. I left the actual explosives in the pantry.\" The argument was cut short by Milo and Kida slipping through the oak panel doors. Vinny poked his head up for a moment. \"Wow! That was fast.\" Audrey had to bite down on her cap to keep from breaking into a fit of snickering. \"That's enough out of you two!\" Sweet interjected. \"Milo, Kida, pay them no mind, now! There ain't no shame in it, no siree! It's a beautiful and natural thing, as God intended!\" \"We weren't… Nevermind,\" Milo conceded, slumping into his chair. \"Ah, there you all are!\" Preston B. Whitmore proclaimed grandly, emerging from the elevator connecting the main house with his subterranean sanctum. \"Where's Mole?\" \"We left him in Paris,\" Milo answered. \"He said he wanted to 'let ze moist caress of his native soil heal his wounded soul'… or something.\" \"Okay, that's disgusting,\" Audrey piped up \"We all gotta deal with heartache somehow…\" Sweet sighed. \"But yes, it is disgusting.\" \"Crying shame, one of my old mason buddies turned me on to something right down his burrow,\" Whitmore observed, unfurling a copy of the Irish Independent and slapping it down on the table, one small article on the front page circled in red ink. GIRL MISSING IN BAY, FATHER BLAMES SEA MONSTER Muireann O'Malley, age 12, missing since last Sunday. Last seen near a beach in Bantry Bay, Co. Cork. Father and harpooner Ned O'Malley, age 41, blames sea-beast for girl's disappearance, though authorities suspect misadventure among treacherous rocks and tides. \"Sea-beast…\" Kida whispered fearfully. Milo squeezed her hand. \"Kida, that doesn't mean anything. People see 'sea-monsters' all the time.\" \"Yeah, like us.\" Vinny began counting off on his fingers. \"We saw the Leviathan, the Kraken, that big tentacle thing back in Paris. Though, technically that was more of a fresh-water monster. I guess that would make this thing like a… like a bay-monster?\" \"Wait…\" Milo paused. \"Bantry Bay?\" \"Is that significant?\" asked Kida. \"It's probably nothing. But according to Irish mythology, Bantry Bay is where Cessair first landed.\" Audrey leaned back in her chair. \"Yeah, Milo, let's pretend you're in a room full of people who don't know anything 'bout Irish mythology?\" \"Oh right, sorry. Well… according to the Lebor Gabála Érenn , the Irish Book of Invasions, Cessair was the granddaughter of Noah and leader of the first human settlers of Ireland. Supposedly, Noah told her to lead her people there to escape the Great Flood.\" \"Did it work?\" Audrey asked. \"Eh… not exactly. They were all wiped out anyway, except for one guy who survived by turning himself into a fish.\" Dr. Sweet slowly arched a skeptical eyebrow. \"Yeah... I'm pretty sure exactly none of that is in the book of Genesis.\" \"Well, Irish mythographers did have a habit of mixing and matching Biblical and pagan sources,\" Milo admitted. \"But Cessair and her people could have been Atlantean colonists fleeing Mabelmok,\" Kida interjected. \"And this 'monster' could be another creation of Atlantean science!\" \"That's certainly possible,\" Milo conceded. \"But-\" \"Then we leave for Ireland, at once!\" Kida pronounced imperiously before sweeping out of the room. \"You know… I always wanted to see Ireland,\" Vinny admitted. [-] Bantry Bay, Co. Cork, Ireland Vinny stood on the prow of the Atlantean , rain soaking into every fiber of clothing on his body. Before him, sprawled a crumbling mold-ridden fishing village under on oppressive black-grey sky. \"Okay, I've seen it. Can we go home now?\" \"Aww come on, Vinny,\" Dr. Sweet beamed, throwing his arm around the Italian. \"Just breathe in that salty air!\" The doctor's nose scrunched slightly. \"Lord, I hope that's salt.\" Kida stepped up to the prow, clad in a lavender woolen jumper, dark blue trousers, and grey raincoat. She gripped an Atlantean spear tight in hand. \"Milo and I will track down the girl's father. The three of you, see what you can learn in the local tavern. We will meet you later.\" Kida commanded before sweeping down the gangplank. \"Uh… what she said,\" Milo added as he hurried to catch up. \"Did she just order us down to the pub?\" Dr. Sweet asked, slightly incredulous. \"Eh,\" Vinny shrugged. \"Works for me.\" \"Last one there buys the first round!\" Audrey yelled, practically leaping over the gangplank. [-] Kida strode along the ramshackle wooden dock, spear slung over her shoulders, heedless of the incessant drizzle as Milo huffed behind. \"Uh… Kida, maybe you shouldn't be waving that spear around?\" Milo suggested. \"Technically, the whole island's in a state of a civil war right now. Someone might get the wrong idea.\" Kida stopped, tilting her head. \"Is that why the people are so ireful?\" \"Yes! I'm mean… wait, what?\" \"It is the Land of Ire, is it not?\" \"Uh… Kida, that's not why they call it-\" \"Hail, Woman of Ire!\" Kida strode up to a crooked old woman who was gutting fish by the peer. \"We seek father and harpooner, Ned O'Malley, age 41!\" The old woman gazed up at the two wordlessly for a moment, before pointing out an old fishing boat tied at the end of the dock with her knife. \"Thank you, good mother!\" Kida sprinted off in the appointed direction, Milo hot on her heels. The old boat almost seemed to age the closer they got to it, the few remaining flecks of white paint peeling from the bare wood. Carved upon the prow was a single word... Tigress Within sat a veritable giant of a man with a wild mane of dusk red hair, running a whetstone along the edge of a harpoon that must have been at least six-foot in length. \"Ned O'Malley?\" Kida inquired. \"What of it?\" the giant whispered, a hint of whiskey on his breath. \"We were wondering if we could ask a few questions about what happened to your daughter?\" Milo asked sheepishly. \"More reporters, eh? Come again to make a laughingstock of daft ol' Ned, thinking his child was spirited away by the merrows?\" \"No… we…\" \"WELL, I'LL NOT HAVE IT!\" the harpooner leaped to his feet, weapon in hand. \"YE HAVEN'T SEEN THE THINGS I'VE SEEN! YE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SEA-DEVIL'S GREAT YELLOW EYES WATCHING YER EVERY MOVE FROM THE MIST! YE HAVEN'T HEARD IT CLAWING AT YER DOOR IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT! YE HAVEN'T…\" Kida and Milo leaped back, expecting the drunk to try and skewer them on his harpoon. Instead, he fell into a quiet whisper. \"The beast took my baby girl… the only flesh and blood I had left on this Earth. I've nothing left to live for…\" His fingers clenched about the harpoon. \"Save for making that monster suffer!\" \"Perhaps... we can help with that?\" Kida offered. The giant eyed her suspiciously, as though seeing her for the very first time. \"And what would be in it for ye?\" Milo rubbed his neck. \"Well… you could tell us exactly what you saw?\" [-] The Hungry Seadog Inn Audrey, Sweet, and a breathless Vinny gazed up at the painted sign hanging over the pub door. It depicted something that looked like a cross between a wolf and a giant fish devouring a hapless sailor; the unlucky soul's legs flailing comically in the air. \"You know…\" Vinny panted. \"That seems in bad taste?\" \"Well… Kida said to check the place out,\" Dr. Sweet shrugged. \"Might as well enjoy some o' that famous Irish hospitality.\" The sound of fiddle playing rang out from the pub's door, only to be instantly silenced as the three stepped over the threshold. Several dozen wary eyes locked on them from the smoky interior. \"Infamous is more like it,\" Audrey mumbled as they sidled up to the bar. \"Ah don't mind them, luv,\" the portly barmaid beamed warmly before turning to her regulars. \"AIN'T NONE O' YE GOBSHITES SEEN TIRED TRAVELERS BEFORE!? EYES BACK IN YER SKULLS!\" The rest of the pub's patrons turned back to their drinks wordlessly. Sweet nodded \"Thanks, Ms…?\" The barmaid shifted seamlessly back into a sugary smile. \"Oh, they just call me Molly around here. What's yer pleasure?\" \"Three pints of your finest larger, please.\" Sweet slapped Vinny on the shoulder. \"Our friend here will cover the cost.\" \"Coming right up,\" Molly began drawing the pumps. \"Sure, why not?\" Vinny glanced about. \"You know, is it just me or do the locals seem a little… tense?\" \"Oh don't take it personally, luv.\" Molly served up three foaming pints. \"They're just a little on edge 'cuz o' the Black n' Tans.\" \"Excuse me?!\" Audrey snapped indignantly. Molly covered her mouth.\"Oh, forgive me, luv! That's not what I meant! I meant the 'Royal Irish Constabulary Special Reserve'. Buncha murdering, raping blackguards that devil Churchill sent over to keep us in our place!\" \"I take it that's why no one's called in the police about that missing girl?\" Sweet asked. \"Young Muireann? Heavens no! God forgive me for saying it but the poor dear's probably safer with the Dobhar-chú.\" Vinny cocked an eyebrow. \"The dober what?\" [-] The Tigress \"Dobhar-chú? That's Gaelic for 'Hound of the Deep' isn't it?\" Asked Milo. \"Aye,\" Ned nodded. \"A beast like a great wolf that moves as well on land as in water, with a ravenous hunger for human flesh! Me na' used to tell stories 'bout it but I never believed her until…\" Milo was suddenly thankful they'd left Obby back in the States. Kida was silent a long time. \"How do we kill it?\" \"We? This isn't a fishing cruise, lass! The Hound is a killer!\" Kida glanced about. Her eyes landed upon a seagull perched atop a barrel, a half-eaten maceral dangling from its beak. Kida let her spear fly, pinning the maceral to a stone wall as the panicked gull took to the sky. Ned tilted his head appreciatively. \"Hop aboard.\" \"Kida, are you sure this is a good idea?\" Milo asked. \"We don't know anything about this creature.\" \"It took a child's life, Milo. That is enough.\" Kida intoned coldly before turning to board. Milo rubbed the back of his neck anxiously as he followed. \"I just hope the others are having better luck than we are.\" [-] \"At Fiddler's Green, where seamen true! When here they've done their duty! The bowl of grog shall still renew! And pledge to love and beauty!\" The dulcet tones of Dr. Sweet rang throughout the pub in harmony with at least half a dozen patrons, each with a cold frothy pint in hand. \"Amazing what buying the whole bar a round can do?\" Audrey observed wryly. \"Alchohol is a beautiful thing, Audrey. It brings people together, you know? Plus it's very flammable.\" Vinny sniffled. \"I think I got something in my eye.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm gonna ask around now that the locals are a little more... lubricated.\" It only took Audrey a moment to spot a knot of spectators huddled about a small table in the corner. At it sat a girl, not more than nineteen, with short-cropped hair that might have been blonde if not for a liberal layer of soot and grime. She was clad in an engineer's overalls. On the table before her lay a pocket-watch, screwdriver, toothpick and a half a pint. She emptied her glass with a single gulp, cracked her knuckles then sat to work rapidly disassembling and reassembling the watch with blinding speed. Her fingers moved with spider-like dexterity, manipulating gears with almost unconscious ease until... \"Nine minutes and thirty seconds!\" spoke one of the patrons, gawking at his own pocket watch. \"Not bad,\" Audrey conceded. \"Bet I can do it in eight.\" The dirty blonde merely smirked, gesturing for Audrey to pull up a seat. [-] \"It was a monster, all right. A cable's length long from beak to tail. And it came a-bellerin' out of the night, with one big eye like a lighthouse.\" the old sailor whispered, chewing anxiously on the stem of his pipe. \"That's great and all, pops,\" Vinny drawled. \"But where exactly did you see this monster, huh?\" \"Off on the far-side of Whiddy Island, out in the bay!\" The old man gesticulating with his pipe in a general north-westerly direction. [-] \"Seven minutes and eighteen seconds!?\" the timekeeper crowed as Audrey snapped the pocket watch's casing shut. \"Nice, you even got rid of that scratching sound it kept making?\" the dirty-blonde engineer purred, holding the reassembled watch up to her ear. \"One of the gears had a malformed tooth, just filed it down a little.\" Audrey shrugged. The dirty-blonde extended a greasy hand. \"Name's Axel.\" \"Audrey,\" the mechanic took the offered hand. \"You don't exactly sound like you're from around here... Brooklyn?\" \"Sorta, my mom was actually from here originally, but we had to leave back in sixteen.\" Axel tilted her head. \"And you... The Bronx?\" \"Born and raised. So what brings ya back to the old country?\" \"Got an engineering job on a ship. It's good work even if the Captain's a tad... intense.\" Audrey frowned. \"I didn't notice any other ships in dock?\" \"Oh... they're around. Buy you a drink?\" Audrey smirked. \"I thought you'd never ask.\" [-] \"At Fiddler's Green, where seamen true! When here they've done their duty! The bowl of grog shall still renew! And pledge to love and beauty!\" \"SHUT THAT RACKET, THIS INSTANT!\" The entire pub went dead silent as every eye swiveled towards the source of the barked order. At the entrance stood three burly looking British policemen in paramilitary gear. Their uniforms were a mismatched hodge-podge of khaki and deep dark-green that looked almost pitch black in the dim light. \"Black and Tans?\" Dr. Sweet whispered to one of the locals, who merely nodded in response. The three swaggered up to the bar, led by a mustachioed sergeant. \"Oi, three brandies, you fat cow! You can put 'em on our tabs.\" His two constables chuckled as a flint-eyed Molly brought them their drinks without as much as a word. Before they'd managed to take their first sip, an old half-drunk sailor stumbled backward, tripping over the long scarf about his neck and spilling his pint all over the sergeant. \"Begging yuir pardon, sair,\" the old sailor pleaded, fretfully attempting to mop up the spillage with his scarf before a heavy hand fell on his shoulders. \"Not at all, my good man.\" The mustachioed sergeant smiled serenely as he winked at his men. \"In fact, why don't we buy you another drink?\" \"R-Really?\" the old sailor asked incredulously. \"Certainly! In fact,\" The sergeant's serene smile twisted into a cruel sneer as he grabbed the old sailor by the collar. \"Why don't we buy you the whole bloody pub!?\" Before the old sailor could react, the three had dragged him behind the bar and pinned him under the pumps. \"Open wide, me old sod!\" the sergeant cackled as his constables forcibly pried open the old man's jaws. He drew down hard on the pumps, forcing a jet of stale larger down the old sailor's throat as his men laughed uproariously. \"Hey, asshole!\" Audrey roared, fist balled The sergeant looked up, eyes narrowed dangerously. \"Bit far from home, aren't ya, girlie?\" \"Yeah, well... Que te folle un pez! \" The sergeant dropped his victim without a word before leaping over the bar with a single-bound, followed closely by his constables. \"It's bad enough I'm stuck on this God-forsaken rock, beating some respect into these drunken Papist muck-savages...\" The sergeant advanced on Audrey. \"But I won't be talked to like that by some filthy... Buck-toothed... WO-AAAAARGHH!\" The sergeant was sent whirling as Audrey's wrench connected with his jaw, collapsing to the ground in a half-conscious heap. One of the constables reached for his revolver, only for his face to be intercepted by Dr. Sweet's fist. \"Whoops! Sorry! Involuntary reaction! Like it has a mind of its own!\" Sweet apologized, before delivering a gut-punch to the still-reeling constable. \"Uh-oh, there goes the other one! Bad fists! Stop it now, ya hear?\" The second constable was about to leap into the fray when he felt a gentle tap on his shoulder. \"Hey, pal. You might wanna take care of that?\" Vinny pointed out the lit stick of dynamite entangled in the constable's belt. The constable let out a panicked scream as he burst from the pub doors, racing down the peer before leaping into the cold sea. He was quickly followed by his compatriots, the half-conscious sergeant shrieking incoherently as the remaining constable carried him out. The locals gawked at the three strangers in almost reverent awe for one long moment before... \"DRINKS ON THE HOUSE!\" Molly proclaimed, followed by ecstatic cheers from the crowd. \"You enjoyed that a little too much?\" Sweet teased Audrey as he attended to the old sailor who thankfully didn't seem worse for wear. \"Eh...Maybe a lil',\" Audrey snorted. \"Not that I don't enjoy a good bar-brawl but I think I gotta lead on our monster?\" Vinny drawled. \"Sure, lemme just say goodbye to...\" Audrey turned towards where she had left Axel, only to find the dirty blonde's table empty. [-] Sgt. Harding cranked the engine of the old jeep furiously with his bare hands, as though he could fuel the vehicle with sheer indignant fury. His rage kept him warm in the endless cold drizzle. \"What are we gonna do now, Sarg?\" a soaking wet Constable Perkins sniffled. Constable Clives moaned something unintelligible through his swollen jaw. \"I'll tell you what we're going to do, lads,\" Harding puffed, face reddening. \"We're going back to the barracks, bring back enough boys to burn this entire filth-ridden sty to the ground, and then… THEN I'm gonna find that buck-tooth doxie and-\" Harding's rant was cut short by an ugly wet thud as Perkins abruptly fell face-down in the mud, quickly followed by Clives. \"PERKINS, CLIVES, GET UP THIS INSTANT! I COULD HAVE YOU SHOT FOR-\" For the first time in Harding's life, his voice failed him as he noticed the needle-like darts protruding from the back of each of his subordinates' necks. Something rustled in the bushes behind him. Then… Everything went black. [-] The Tigress \"Carrots… Why is it always carrots?\" Milo moaned, leaning over the boat's side as the former contents of his stomach were washed away by the waves. Ned shot a glance over his shoulder as he manned the wheel. \"Yuir sure he'll be able to handle himself?\" \"Milo has great reserves of hidden strength,\" Kida assured as her consort retched again. \"Aye… Well hidden.\" The Tigress patrolled the shallows, hugging the coastline. Kida scanned the sea, trying to peer through the light, almost-misty, rain. \"Would it not make more sense to hunt the Dobhar-chú in deeper seas?\" Ned shook his head. \"The Hound fears the open waters… it never strays far from the coast.\" \"What could a man-eating sea-monster possibly be afraid of?\" Milo wondered aloud. \"It should fear me,\" Ned hissed. \"After what it did to my blessed Muireann?\" Milo stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"Has anyone else in the village gone missing lately, or been attacked by the Dobhar-chú?\" \"Not that I know of,\" Ned shrugged. \"What does it matter?\" \"It's just that most predators avoid humans unless they're desperate or insane. And those that do almost never stop at just-\" \"ENOUGH!\" Ned bellowed, eyes blazing. \"The Hound is no mortal animal! It's a demon from the pits of Hell, and I intend to send it ba-\" The three hunters lost their footing as the boat suddenly lurched to one side, almost capsizing. Kida staggered to her feet. \"What happened?\" \"Did we hit a rock?\" Milo suggested. \"No…\" Ned whispered darkly. Something burst from the water's surface, landing with liquid grace upon the boat's prow. Its overall body shape was like a cross between a giant wolf and a shark, all smooth contours and over seven feet long. Its greenish skin was scaled like a pike's. Its webbed, almost prehensile, toes ended in barbed hooks. Gills along the side of its otter-like neck fluttered in the night air. Shimmering yellow eyes peered out from under the mop of oil-slick black hair clinging wetly from its scalp. \"Ancient Kings preserve us,\" Kida whispered. The Dobhar-chú's lips peeled back to reveal a crocodile's toothy grin. Then it pounced. To Be Continued...[Chapter 2] Team Atlantis and all related characters and concepts are the property of the Walt Disney Company. Everything else in this tale is drawn from history both real and imaginary. S.S. Atlantean , Bantry Bay, Co. Cork, Ireland, 1920 A.D. \"He proposed? Congratz, Marge. What does that make… three now?\" Wilhelmina Bertha Packard droned into her headset. \"Believe me, honey, it gets easier every time.\" \"Uh… Mrs. Packard?\" Dr. Sweet softly interjected. Packard eyed Sweet like a wolf who just had her meal disturbed. Sweet responded with an ingratiating grin. \"Gonna have to call you back, Marge. Got another call on the line.\" She flipped a switch. \" Atlantean to Sub-Pod 1. Come in, Sub-Pod 1. Unless you got something better to do?\" [-] Sub-Pod 1 \"Sub-Pod 1, here,\" the Audrey answered. \"We musta swept half the island's coast and no sign of any monster. Just a lotta silt and seaweed. It's almost like someone's been listening to too many old fish stories.\" \"What can I say, the old guy had an honest face,\" Vinny shrugged, sitting next to her in the sub's tiny cockpit. \"Kinda reminded me of my grandpops… or maybe it was my plumber? I don't actually remember what my grandpops looked like. Grandma burned all his photographs and made us swear never to speak of him again. Very proud woman.\" \"We'll keep you posted, Atlantean . Sub-Pod 1 out,\" She hung up the mic, returning her hand to the steering wheel. \"I just hope this isn't gonna be like that time in Loch Ness.\" \"Tell me 'bout it,\" Vinny drawled. \"Two weeks in a itty-bitty submarine going back and forth, back and forth, over twenty-three miles of lake. No monster, no nothing, not even like a… like a really big eel. Okay, I mean...Mole said he saw an eel. But nobody else saw it... and Mole also said it had wings... and the guy sleeps in fertilizer, so...\" Audrey leaned forward as something caught her eye, a massive jagged shape resting on the seabed. Only its general outline was visible through the silt. She squinted. \"What is that?\" \"Eh, probably just a reef,\" Vinny shrugged before the sub-pod started to vibrate ominously. [-] S.S. Atlantean \"Doctor… I think you're gonna want to hear this?\" Packard offered Sweet an earpiece. Sweet listened intently to something like a deep low rumble. \"What is that, a motorboat?\" \"No… much bigger.\" [-] Sub-Pod 1 Audrey and Vinny shielded their eyes as the cockpit was abruptly filled with a blinding geenish-blue light emanating from what looked like the massive… thing's eyes. They could barely make out its silhouette in the murk as it rose from the seabed; long and sleek like a predator. Its head tapered to a swordfish-like lance. \"What the heck is that thing?!\" Audrey gasped. \"Don't worry 'bout it, I gotta lil' something special ready,\" Vinny's hand hovered over a conspicuous red button. \"I call this… the Monster-Buster!\" A torpedo was sent flying from the sub-pod's hydrofoils, impacting its target with enough explosive force to send the tiny pod reeling from the shockwaves. Audrey scrambled back into her seat. \"You coulda warned me!\" \"Maybe a lil' less paprika next time?\" Vinny righted himself, straightening his 'tash. \"Anyway, important thing is we killed the monster so now we can go home and-\" The vast predatory shape emerged from the swirling silt, lightning arcing across its swordfish lance as it turned on the mini-sub. \"Okay, now you can worry 'bout it.\" [-] S.S. Atlantean The bay waters pulsed a bright blue, like sheet-lightning through a storm-cloud, before returning to an inscrutable greenish-black. Dr. Sweet stood on the prow of the Atlantean , praying silently as he scanned the waves for any sign of life. Cold sweat and colder rain beading upon his brow. After some of the longest and most excruciating minutes of his life, Sweet's prayers were finally answered as a water-logged Audrey and Vinny broke the surface; paddling frantically. \"You two, lower me down and tell the nurse to get the decon chamber ready!\" Sweet barked at some adjacent crewmen as he leaped into a lifeboat. Within moments, he was helping his soaking comrades aboard. \"You two okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Vinny drawled, wringing saltwater from his 'tash. \"Next time, I'm throwing in a whole jar of paprika!\" A few scorched fragments of the sub-pod broke the surface. \"That ain't comin' outta my paycheck.\" Audrey piped. Dr. Sweet let out a low whistle. \"Well good news is Milo and Kida can't possibly be having a worse night than we are.\" [-] The Tigress \"DIE, HOUND!\" Ned shrieked, lunging at the Dobhar-chú with his great barbed harpoon. The creature seemed to slide rather than crawl over the wooden deck, easily avoiding the strike. Ned lunged again and again, only for the beast to dodge each attack until the harpoon finally embedded itself in the Tigress ' wheelhouse. A defenseless Ned frantically tried to pull his weapon loose as the Dobhar-chú warily advanced. Kida leaped into the fray, slashing the distracted sea-beast's paw with the curved blade of her spear. The Dobhar-chú let loose a howl before striking back with its heavy shark-like tail, sending Kida hurtling into Milo. Before the two adventures could regain their footing, the Dobhar-chú pounced on Ned. The normally stoic harpooner screamed in terror as the sea-hound's jaws grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, like a she-wolf with an unruly pup. The Dobhar-chú's gleaming yellow eyes glanced about for only an instant before diving back into the waters from whence it came, a squirming Ned in tow. \"NO!\" Kida cried as she and Milo rushed to the side of the boat, but it was already too late. All that was left of either the Dobhar-chú or Ned O'Malley was a slight ripple upon the surface of the brackish waters. [-] S.S. Atlantean Kida and Milo trudged sorrowfully into the sickbay, leaving a trail of vaguely footprint shaped puddles in their wake. Dr. Sweet let out a low whistle. \"I take it back. Looks like everybody's having a bad night?\" \"You have no idea,\" Milo sighed. Kida leaned against one of the empty cots, head cradled in her hands. \"A man died tonight.\" \"Kida, we don't know for sure that-\" \"Yes, we do, Milo! Why else would that beast have-\" Knock-knock. Kida, Milo and Sweet's heads swiveled towards the decon chamber, where Audrey and Vinny's faces peered out from behind a glass porthole. \"You saw it too, huh?\" Audrey asked. \"The monster? Yes!\" Kida answered. \"A vile sea-hound with yellow eyes and barbed claws!\" \"Musta been at least three hundred feet!\" Audrey added \"Uh, more like seven… eight maybe?\" Milo offered. \"Needle-like fangs…\" \"Shooting lightning outta its great big horn!\" Vinny chimed. \"Wait… stop!\" Milo threw his arms in the air. \"A giant horn? Shooting lightning? That's not anything like the creature we saw!\" \"Where and when did you see this horned monster?\" Kida demanded. \"'Bout an hour ago… on the other side of the big island in the bay.\" Audrey shrugged. Kida and Milo looked at each other in horror. \"That was around the same time we saw the Dhobar-chú by the coast!\" Kida gasped. \"Hold on, back up,\" Dr. Sweet's signaled a time-out. \"Are you telling me there are two monsters in this bay?!\" [-] Somewhere… Stg. Harding gasped as the burlap sack was pulled from his head. His eyes screwed tight against the blinding electric lamp directed upon him. He was kneeling, chained to some sort of iron platform by his wrists. He could hear the waves softly lapping in the blackness beyond, amid the incessant patter of rain on metal. Beneath his chained limbs, he felt the distinct rhythmic swaying of a vessel at sea. Shapes coalesced as his vision returned. To either side knelt Constables Perkins and Clives, similarly restrained. Surrounding them were at least a dozen other shapes. Most prominent was a gaunt greying Negro. He was clad in a strange uniform of a dark blue material and brandished what looked like an air-rifle or harpoon gun. The rest were clad in the same strange dark-blue uniform, save for the sable masks that obscured even their faces. Upon each figure's left breast was a sigil of pale whitish gold, like a stylized N . \"Who are they, sarge?\" Perkins whimpered. \"Are they Fenians?\" \"Hush, Perkins. Let me handle this,\" Harding hissed. \"Alright, you ignorant muck-savages! By the Authority vested my me by His Majesty, George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of-\" \"Enough,\" a voice rang out; harsh, cold and metallic. \"Captain on deck!\" The strange crew instantly formed themselves into duel files, standing to attention as a new figure strode forward with inexorable purpose. The figure was clad in a greatcoat of dark, almost ebon, blue. A long curved saber hung sheathed from the belt. Head crowned with a jeweled turban like a Raja. The face was obscured by a mask of the same pale whitish gold, cast in the shape of a death's head. The figure loomed over Harding. He could almost feel the boundless cold fury before which his own anger felt like a small pitiful thing, like a candle before the tsunami. He felt his anger shrivel to dread. \"You have no authority here, bootlick\" the specter spoke in a low, chillingly resonant voice. \"Nor does your infantile monarch. Here I am law. Here… I am judge.\" Harding felt a cry of defiance strangle in his throat. \"Crewman Axel?\" \"Aye, Captain?\" one of the masked crew answered \"These are the men you spoke of?\" \"Aye, Captain,\" she spat. \"Gentlemen…\" The Captain sneered the word, like a bad joke. \"You stand accused of trespass, theft, murder, and rapine! Have you anything to say in your defense?\" \"How dare you, Sir?!\" Harding huffed. \"We are honorable servants of the Crown! We have stolen nothing! We have-\" \"YOU HAVE STOLEN THIS ENTIRE ISLAND!\" The Captain roared. \"For eight centuries you have torn the food from its children's mouths, shed the blood of its sons in wars not their own, and tied to strip its people even of their faith!\" \"And not just this island,\" The Captain continued unabated. \"India, Africa, Australia, Polynesia, even the Americas! Everywhere the sun touches, your empire has brought nothing but slavery, degradation, and death!\" \"Y-you can't blame us for all that!\" Perkins sputtered. \"We were just-URK!\" The Captain's gloved fingers clamped down on Perkin's throat, squeezing the breath from his air-pipe. \"You accepted blame for 'all that' the moment you donned that uniform,\" the Captain hissed before tossing the gasping captive to the ground. \"Even if your own personal sins were not enough to damn you.\" \"And what of it!?\" Harding snarled, blood boiling. \"It only proves that we are the natural superiors! It is our God-given right to rule over inferior savages! We are children of Albion's fair sun, a race of conquerors and explorers! Bold! Fearless! Undaunt-\" \"IT WAS THE SARGE'S IDEA! HE MADE US DO IT!\" Perkins wailed, throwing himself at the Captain's feet. \"We didn't want to hurt the old man! We were only following orders! Isn't that right, Clives!?\" A trembling Clives nodded frantically. \"Well... we have a confession then.\" The Captain turned to the greying Negro. \"Number One, take the crew below and make preparations to dive.\" \"With pleasure, Captain,\" The evident First Mate struck his left breast in salute. \"Mobilis in Mobili!\" \"Mobilis in Mobili!\" the crew chorused before filing back down into the vessel's interior. \"Wait!\" Harding sputtered. \"What are you going to do with us!?\" \"Nothing more,\" the Captain intoned, turning to follow the crew. \"The trial is concluded, your guilt proved, your sentence passed. All that remains is for you to await your executioner. May your god be more merciful than mine.\" \"Y-you can't do this!\" Harding stammered. \"What kind of man are you!?\" The Captain stopped, fixing Harding with an inscrutable gaze. \"As Ulysses spoke unto the cyclops… I am no man.\" A hatch slammed shut as the Captain vanished from view. The blinding electric light was snuffed out, plunging Harding and his men into pitch darkness. The vessel rumbled beneath their feet as cold, uncaring waves began to lap at their knees. [-] Elsewhere… Ned O'Malley awoke to cold brackish waves lapping against his face. He scrambled out of the water through the pitch darkness in a blind panic, feeling wet half-rotted wood beneath his fingers. He took a moment to master himself, slowing his breathing and reaching for the matchbox he always kept in his back pocket. The box was cast of a tightly fitted copper which, God willing, should have kept the matches dry. He pried the lid open. The contents felt dry enough but there'd only be one way to know for sure. Whispering a quiet prayer to the Blessed Virgin, he struck the match. To Ned's everlasting gratitude, light filled the chamber, revealing him to be lying within a half-submerged cabin on what looked like an old capsized sailing ship. Algae-encrusted walls leaned inwards as they reached for the ceiling, or rather deck, above. \"Well, that solves one mystery.\" The dim flickering light revealed the wooden walls to be covered in countless scratch-marks. They were not random but rather arranged into a veritable mural of crude pictures, vaguely like those he'd see carved into wood by South Sea islanders back during his whaling days. Ned's hand reached out to one image in particular; a clumsily etched stick figure in a triangular dress, a mess of scribbles serving for a mop of unruly hair. By the stick-girl's side, towered a giant of a stick-man, brandishing an oversized arrow. \"Muireann…?\" The match died. Before Ned could light another, the waters at the far end of the cabin began to churn and bubble. He felt around for a weapon, grabbing up a rotted wooden chair-leg lying among the flotsam. The Dhobar-chú's yellow eyes slithered from the water, regarding its prisoner with a cryptic gaze. It paused uncertainly, before taking a single hesitant step forward. \"Back, Hound!\" Ned barked, swinging wide with his improvised weapon. The Dhobar-chú recoiled, whimpering like a scolded puppy. \"Well, what are ye waiting for?\" Ned panted. \"Ye can't seriously be afraid of a soggy stick!?\" The Dhobar-chú tried to force a sound through its malformed lips, only to come out as a dull groan. \"Well? Come on, then! FINISH ME, LIKE YOU FINISHED MUIREANN!\" The Dhobar-chú twisted its lips once more, forcing out another sound. This time it was a single unmistakable word… \"Daaaaaaaaddddyyyyy…\" To Be Concluded…[Chapter 3] Team Atlantis and all related characters and concepts are the property of the Walt Disney Company. Everything else in this tale is drawn from history both real and imaginary. The Hungry Seadog Inn, Banty Bay, Co. Cork, Ireland, 1920 A.D. Pale grey daylight filtered through the rivulets of rainwater running down the bay window, giving the pub's interior an oddly colder cast then it had the night before. Two rectangular tables had been shoved together and strewn with maps and charts depicting the village, the bay and the surrounding countryside for miles around. Around them sat Kida, Milo, Audrey, Dr. Sweet, and Vinny. \"There must be something we're missing here,\" Milo ran his fingers through his stringy chestnut hair. \"Okay, what do we know so far?\" \"We know the Dhobar-chú hunts along the coastline,\" spoke Kida. \"And that big lightning-monster's skulking around somewhere in the deep bay,\" Audrey chipped in. \"Ned said the Dhobar-chú was afraid of deep water…\" Milo stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"Maybe the lightning monster is some kind of super-predator that's hunted the Dhobar-chú to near extinction?\" \"I guess it's true what they say,\" Vinny drawled. \"There's always a bigger fish.\" \"Grub's up!\" Molly the barmaid swooped in, rapidly dispensing five bowls of watery oxtail stew. \"Anything else, luvs?\" \"No, but thanks again, Molly,\" Sweet shook his head. \"Not unless you know any good monster hang-outs hereabouts?\" \"Well…\" she paused, a strangely far-away look gleaming in her eye. \"If I were a giant unholy man-devouring beastie lookin' to set up shop 'round these parts… I suppose my best bet would probably be Le Vengeur .\" Audrey cocked her head. \"Le what now?\" \"It's an old wreck about five miles up the coast, part of an armada sent by France to aid Wolfe Tone's Rebellion back in 1798,\" Molly sighed wistfully. \"Obviously, it dinnea help much.\" The five adventures exchanged a few glances. Milo shrugged. \"It's as good a place as any to start, I guess.\" [-] Le Vengeur A high pitched whirring echoed through once silent corridors of the old derelict as a spinning saw-blade sliced a six by six foot square in the hull. Someone grunted as they kicked the wooden panel inwards, allowing clear grey-white daylight to penetrate the ancient wreck for the first time in over a century. A rope ladder tumbled down from above before Vinny began climbing down. \"You know, I coulda just blown our way in?\" \"Yeah...\" Audrey clambered after, a portable circular-saw and battery-pack strapped to her back. \"We kinda need the boat intact if we wanna search it, Vinny.\" They were followed in short order by Kida, Milo and Dr. Sweet, the soft blue glow of their Atlantean crystals lighting the way. \"Maybe we should split up and cover more ground?\" Milo suggested. Kida nodded. \"Milo and I will search the fore of the ship, the rest of you take the aft.\" \"How will we know if the other team finds the monster first?\" asked Dr. Sweet. \"Easy,\" Vinny shrugged. \"We just follow the screams.\" [-] Kida and Milo had been wandering the inverted corridors for about a quarter of an hour before they came to their first obstacle. The wooden passage before them sloped downwards, vanishing into the dark waters. \"It seems we are at an impasse,\" Kida spoke before stripping off her long coat and thick navy blue jumper. She had just kicked off her boots and shimmied out of her trousers when she paused to turn to Milo. \"Are you not joining me?\" Milo's jaw hung low, eyes agog. \"K-Kida... a-are y-you sure... I mean right now...?\" Kida smirked as she cupped his chin. \"For a swim, Milo.\" \"Oh... Right,\" Milo grinned sheepishly, stripping down to his vest and boxers. \"That said,\" Kida purred, now clad only in her pale blue bandeau, bottoms and a sheathed dagger. \"If you'd care to join me in our cabin aboard the Atlantean after our mission here is done...?\" She let the thought hang unspoken in the air as she slipped into the water. Milo watched dumbstruck for a sec before smacking himself across the face. \"Okay, Milo. Focus!\" He dived in after, letting the light of Kida's crystal light his way through the sunless waters. After a couple minutes, Milo's chest began to ache. His lungs would soon be screaming for air. If they didn't turn back now... Kida signaled urgently, he followed her lead as they emerged into a mercifully placed air-pocket. Milo gasped greedily before Kida clamped a hand tightly over his mouth. In their crystals' light, Milo began making out their surroundings. It was a half-submerged cabin, walls covered with chaotic disjointed scratchings. In one corner slumped the still form of Ned O'Malley, clutching a broken chair leg. Across from him curled the Dhobar-chú, its gulls fluttering rhythmically as it slept. \"Tend to O'Malley,\" Kida whispered. \"I will deal with the Hound.\" Milo nodded, slipping out of the water and up to the unconscious harpooner. Thankfully, his pulse and breathing seemed steady enough. \"Mr. O'Malley... Ned...?\" Milo whispered, trying to shake the man awake as discreetly as possible. Meanwhile, Kida silently stalked towards the slumbering Dhobar-chú. She slowly drew her dagger from its sheath. With luck, she would end this horror with a single strike. \"W-whaa...?\" Ned moaned climbing back to consciousness. His eyes abruptly darted open, catching the glint of Kida's blade as she raised it high. \"NOOOO!\" Ned screamed, shoving Milo aside and pouncing on Kida like a man possessed. The two combatants fell to the ground, each frantically struggling to wrest control of the dagger. \"KIDA!\" Milo yelled, leaping upon the giant harpooner's back and letting loose with a flurry of balled fists. Something snarled as gleaming yellow eyes pounced from the dark. Next thing Milo knew, the Dhobar-chú had him pinned to the rotted planks. It's crocodile-like teeth hovered mere inches from his throat, as its rancid breath invaded his nostrils. \"MUIREANN, STOP!\" Ned cried out! The Dhobar-chú instantly released Milo, retreating back into its corner with a whimper. Ned released a stunned Kida, rushing to throw his arms around the sea-hound. \"There, girl...\" he murmured softly, stroking the creature's wet mane. \"They dinne mean any harm. They just dinne understand.\" \"Wait!? You?! Her!?\" Milo panted. \"WHAT!?\" [-] Le Vengeur \"Hold up!\" Dr. Sweet spoke incredulously. \"Are you telling me the little girl we all thought got eaten by a monster… is the monster?\" \"Don't take this the wrong way, Milo,\" Vinny drawled. \"But that sounds just a lil' bit… What's the word I'm looking for?\" \" Loco ?\" Audrey offered. \"Loco's good,\" Vinny nodded. \"Yeah… that's what Mr. Harcourt used to say about Atlantis,\" Milo snorted. \"But look here, Muireann's explained everything!\" Milo ran his fingers along a scratch-drawing of a stick-girl horizontal amid swirling spirals, some sort of rectangular construct dead ahead. \"Looks like she was swimming when she found some kinda door or cave… She must have gone in exploring, is that right?\" The Dhobar-chú, or rather Muireann, nodded her hound-like head enthusiastically as her father stroked her soggy mane. The stick-girl raised her two-dimensional limbs protectively, as jagged shapes rained down on her. \"There was… an accident, an earthquake or cave-in?\" The stick-girl now lay on her back, arms and limbs twisted in painfully unnatural ways. No one needed Milo to interpret that for them. A new figure loomed over the fallen stick-girl, tall, gaunt and indistinct. Its only distinguishing feature was a crudely carved skull-like visage, crowned with what looked like a saint's halo. \"Who… or what is that?\" Kida whispered. \"The Angel of Death, maybe?\" Milo suggested. \"Poor kid must have been delirious.\" The stick-girl found herself surrounded by a bizarre assortment of strangely angled lines that, to Milo's antiquarian eye looked almost, like a sarcophagus or… \"Jiminy Christmas!\" Milo exclaimed, as his brain finally caught up. \"It's a machine!\" The stick-girl was at last replaced entirely by a four-legged blob-like beast, its mouth a mess of triangular teeth. \"I've done you a great wrong, Muireann, and almost did you an unforgivable one.\" Kida knelt before the Dhobar-chú, noticing the wound left by her spear on the girl-beast's paw. \"May I?\" The Dhobar-chú looked to her father. \"S'alright, girl,\" Ned cooed. \"She won't hurt ye.\" The girl-beast offered her paw to Kida, who held her crystal to the oozing wound. Shimmering blue light danced about the injury sealing it shut as though it had never existed. \"Blessed Mother…\" Ned whispered. \"Please, tell me… is there anything you can do for my Muireann?\" \"Perhaps,\" Kida offered. \"If Muireann can show us exactly where this was done?\" The Muireann tilted her head thoughtfully. [-] Beneath Bantry Bay Muireann slid through the waters with a grace that belied her monstrous form, the last rays of the dying sun dancing upon her scales. She paused only to snap up a passing conger eel, wolfing down the squirming fish in a few short gulps. Two sub-pods followed in her wake, functional but ungainly by comparison. [-] \"You know, I think I'm gonna cut down on the seafood from now on,\" Vinny drawled. He was manning the gunner position on Sub-Pod 3. Audrey sat in the pilot's seat beside him, while Dr. Sweet haunched in the back. \"You sure leaving its-\" Audrey caught herself. \"I mean, her dad back on the Atlantean was a good idea?\" \"Man just spent the night sleeping in a puddle of freezing saltwater!\" Sweet protested. \"Last thing that poor girl needs is her daddy keeling over from hypothermia.\" [-] Over in Sub-Pod 2, Milo and kida watched as Muireann stopped before a looming stone gateway. Its cyclopean frame was engraved with countless antediluvian glyphs. Milo squinted. \"It certainly looks Atlantean, maybe with some Late Lemurian influences?\" Muireann lingered at the threshold, turning to fix Kida with a pleading gaze through the sub-pod's windows. \"She is afraid.\" \"Can't say I blame her,\" said Milo. \"Maybe if we go in first?\" Kida nodded her agreement as Milo guided the sub-pod through the narrow corridor. \"You know, I think I'm getting better at steering this-\" Milo was cut off by a short sharp high-pitched screech, like iron nails on a granite chalkboard. \"What was that?\" Kida asked nonchalantly. \"Nothing!\" Milo grinned awkwardly, head sinking into his collar. [-] The sub-pods broke the surface in what looked like an immense subterranean grotto. Crumbled stone stubs that might have once been docks abutted the water, almost like a sub pen. Audrey let out a low whistle, clambering out Sub-Pod 3's hatch. \"Mole's gonna be sorry he missed this.\" She was followed in short order by Dr. Sweet and Vinny, as well as Kida and Milo in Sub-Pod 2. Last of all, came Muireann, slithering out of the water. Her hound-like head darted in all directions as though expecting attack from every shadow. \"It is alright, Muireann…\" Kida bent low, holding the girl-beast close. \"We will not abandon you here.\" The girl-beast stalked forward, her thread steady if cautious, down a long shadowed passage. \"Ow!\" Audrey cried, stumbling slightly as they followed. \"You okay?\" Vinny asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Audrey replied. \"Musta tripped on something is all.\" \"You should be more careful,\" Vinny drawled. \"I had a cousin who tripped on a rock and dislocated his ankle once. It was a nightmare, foot all swinging off the leg like a lantern. Made a lil' squeaking noise.\" Milo ran his fingers along the glyphs carved all across the passage walls. \"What you make of it?\" Sweet asked. \"I'm not sure, a lot of it looks pretty technical,\" Milo admitted. \"Frankly, Doc, I think this might be more your area of expertise.\" Sweet tilted his head, intrigued. \"Oh?\" \"Well, near as I can tell this was some kind of research lab. Whoever built this place was looking for ways to manipulate something called the 'code of life'.\" Milo paused before a glyph vaguely resembling two intertwined snakes. \"Does that mean anything to you?\" \"Maybe,\" Sweet stroked. \"Biologists have always known there must be some kinda medium in living cells that controls what traits get passed to the next generation. You know, eye color, blood type, that sorta thing? Could be a protein or a molecule.\" \"Could tampering with this 'code of life' have transformed Muireann,\" Kida asked. \"Why not?\" Sweet admitted sombrely. \"The Good Lord's been tinkering with His creatures since life began. He just takes His time is all.\" \"According to Darwin, all life came out of the sea originally. Maybe the ancient Atlanteans wanted to see if they could reverse the process?\" Milo mused. \"Well, I may be no biologist, but I can still read directions. The machine Muireann drew should be just around this…\" Milo's eyes went wide as they entered the main chamber. It was completely and utterly empty. Even the ancient tiled mosaics that must have once covered the walls had been pried loose, leaving only bare stone. \"No, no, no!\" Milo fretted, running back and forth across the room. \"This is impossible! It should be here! Who else would even know about this place!?\" Muireann whimpered mournfully, pawing at a large dustless rectangle in the middle of the floor. Kida kneeled down, taking the beast's hound-like head in her hands as she stared into her yellow eye. \"Muireann... I promise you, we will find whoever stole the machine that transformed you, even if I must pry it from their cold still grasp.\" They raced back to the grotto, stopping short as the waters churned ominously. Three new sub-pods rose from the waters, utterly unlike the models used by Whitmore Industries. Their sleek obsidian hulls were spiraled like the shells of giant prehistoric mollusks, portholes glowing a strange greenish-blue. \"Somebody expecting company?\" Vinny asked. The hatches of the strange sub-pods hissed like sea-serpents as they were thrown open, disgorging at least half a dozen masked figures in strange deep-blue uniforms and carrying bizarre weapons that sizzled and crackled with the scent of ozone. Their leader was a tall, gaunt figure clad in an ebon-blue greatcoat, face obscured by a skull-like mask of pale whitish gold. \"The Angel of Death,\" Kida whispered as Muireann huddled behind her. The skull-faced specter gazed down balefully on the assembled adventurers, before speaking in a cold metallic hiss… \"Surrender the child.\" \"Over my dead body!\" Kida snarled, pointing her spear directly at the intruder. \"Whoa…whoa…\" Milo's interceded, hands raised in what he hoped was a non-threating manner. \"Maybe we can all just put down all our weapons and-\" \"The time for negotiations passed the moment you struck us unprovoked,\" the specter intoned. Audrey shot Vinny a glare. \"Ooooh, that was you guys?\" Vinny drawled. \"Sorry 'bout that. Thought you were like… a giant monster swordfish or somethin'. Maybe a big barracuda.\" \"How did you even find this place?!\" Milo blurted \"Who are you people!?\" \"I am master of all the Deep's secrets, American. I am the sword of the oppressed, the scourge of all empires…\" the figure intoned like a judge pronouncing sentence. \"I am Nemo.\" Milo's jaw nearly fell off its hinges. \"What!? You… You can't! You're not real!\" \"Enough,\" spoke the Captain. \"Number One, deal with these pests.\" \"With pleasure, Captain,\" the First Mate sneered, drawing two weapons like steel batons hooked up to a battery pack strapped to his back. With a flick of a switch, the batons were wreathed in arcs of crackling electricity. \"MOBILIS IN MOBILI!\" the First Mate bellowed, leaping directly at Milo with weapons raised high. Kida pushed Milo aside as the electro-batons connecting with the ground sending sparks flying. Before the First Mate could strike again, Dr. Sweet leaped from behind, grabbing the assailant in a lock that pinned both arms above the head. \"I got this!\" Sweet yelled, his captive trashing wildly in his grip. \"You two stop that lunatic!\" \"Thanks, Doc!\" as he and Kida raced off. The First Mate hooked a foot around Sweet's ankle, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Sweet grabbed hold of the First Mate's mask as he tumbled, yanking it off to reveal the face of a grey-templed Negro. \"A doctor?\" the First Mate sneered, stalking towards Sweet with crackling electro-batons. \"Isn't that cute?\" [-] \"Easy girl,\" one of Nemo's masked crew whispered, stalking towards the cowering Muireann with a raised air-rifle. \"We're just gonna take a nice loooong nap.\" Before she could pull the trigger, something in a mechanic's overalls barrelled into her with all the force of a freight train. Audrey Ramirez pinned her captive to the ground, ready to unleash a rain of balled fists when… \"Audrey, wait!\" the crewman blurted. Audrey paused, yanking off the blue-black mask to reveal the dirty-blond hair and grimy face beneath. \"Axel!?\" Axel's fist connected with Audrey's jaw, sending the mechanic slumping to the ground. \"Sorry, luv, I really did like you.\" Axel retrieved the air-rifle, taking aim at the fleeing Muireann. A single metal dart pierced the fish-hound scales, causing her to stumbled and collapse into a motionless lump just at the water's edge. The attackers began securing a still Muireann in a thick net before dragging her towards their main sub-pod, where a grim Nemo watched the battle from on high. \"NOO!\" Kida screamed. \"Milo, help Muireann!\" \"What are you going to be doing!?\" \"Stopping this at its source.\" Kida's eyes narrowed as she took off at running dash. In a blur of motion, she vaulted over the waters with her spear, landed atop the enemy sub-pod, and struck… The blade of Nemo's curved saber, drawn with enough blinding speed to parry Kida's spear. \"And who might you be?\" Asked Nemo, sounding more amused than angered. \"I am Kidagakash Nedakh, Daughter of Kashekim and Queen of Atlantis!\" \"Well, 'Your Majesty', queen or no…\" The Captain leaned close over locked blades, till Kida could make out her own reflection in the golden skull-mask. \"None strike Nemo twice.\" [-] \"You're a joke, you realize that?\" The First Mate snarled, swiping again at Sweet with an electro-baton. \"Well, I'm often complimented on my sense of humor.\" Sweet smiled nervously, narrowly dodging yet another electric. \"I used to be like you, you know? Thought if I got myself an education, a career, proved them wrong, that it would change things!\" The First Mate struck again, burning two charred trails in the stone wall. \"But nothing was ever good enough!\" Sweet ducked, only to find himself backed up against a solid granite pillar. \"It doesn't matter well we dress and speak, how hard we work, or even how smart we are! They'll just keep inventing new impossible standards without even trying to live up to them themselves,\" the First Mate snarled, raising his weapons for another strike. \"The only way to achieve any real freedom in this world is to TAKE IT!\" Sweet barely grabbed the First Mate's insulated wrists in mid-swing, electro batons hovering mere inches above. \"Now, I don't deny you make some valid points,\" Sweet groaned through a gritted grin, sweat beading his brow as the electro-batons inched ever closer to his bare face. \"But how about you put away those crazy lightning-sticks so we can discuss your political philosophy in a more relaxed, non-lethal context?\" \"You smile too much,\" the First Mate whispered darkly before forcing the tips of his electro-batons down on Sweet's broad shoulders, shocking the doctor into unconsciousness. [-] \"EEEAAAAYGGH!\" Milo screamed, ducking as one of Nemo's crew swung at him with what looked like an electrified gauntlet. Milo couldn't tell whether the hairs standing atop the back of his neck were due to the static or his shrieking terror. \"Hey, buddy. Catch.\" The crewman raised his electrified fingers, instinctive catching something that promptly exploded in his grasp. The crewmen wailed as his gauntlet caught fire, waving the weapon frantically in the air before leaping thoughtlessly into the water. The crewman convulsed for a moment before falling back flat-faced on the shore. \"Hey, buddy,\" Vinny drawled, stepping into Milo's field of vision. \"You never ever grab hold of a lighted fireworks. You could lose like a finger or a hand or something. Maybe an eye even. Oh and don't ever try and put out an electrical fire with water. Eugh… kids these days. They never listen.\" \"Thanks, Vinny,\" Milo panted as the demolitionist helped him to his feet. \"I owe you want.\" \"For you, Milo, anything.\" Vinny pulled a pair of thick rubber gloves from his duster. \"Say, could you help me drag my new buddy new back to one of the sub-pods? Seems kinda cruel to just leave the poor guy here when the whole place goes boom.\" \"Sure thing, Vinny,\" Milo nodded taking a rubber glove. \"Just let meWHOAWAITWHAT!?\" \"Oh yeah, while you guys were having your big fight,\" Vinne drawled. \"I may have kinda rigged the whole cave to blow. You know, just in case?\" \"B-But… WHY would you even do that?!\" \"Eh, Milo… Have you met me?\" [-] \"By what right do you to plunder the relics of my people, pirate!?\" Kida demanded, spear thrusting forward. \"Your 'people' plundered half the globe to build their empire,\" Nemo answered, parrying the thrust. \"An empire whose glories were built on the backs of slaves! I reclaim Atlantis' treasures in the name of those who paid for them with their blood; your victims!\" Kida spun on her heels, smashing the blunt end of her spear into Nemo's face. The golden skull-mask cracked under the impact, sending the captain falling upon the hull of the sub-pod. \"You may actually believe that,\" Kida panted, regaining her balance as the pod lurched beneath them. \"But I will allow no man to abuse Atlantean science in yet another mad crusade!\" Nemo's boot lunged with the speed of a cobra, sweeping Kida's feet out from under her. She tumbled backward, barely grasping a handhold as she dangled from the sub-pod's side. Nemo loomed above her, tearing loose the cracked mask to reveal the face beneath… It was a woman with the cast of a queen; copper skin, raven hair, with eyes as dark and hard as onyx. Ears and nose pierced by jewelry of the same whitish gold. She glared down at Kida with infinite contempt. \"Nemo is no man.\" She brought her boot down hard on the Kida's fingers, sending the Queen of Atlantis plummeting to the waters below. Nemo raised her curved saber high. \"All hands to me!\" \"Mobilis in Mobili!\" the remaining crew chorused, securing the still unconscious Muireann to one of the enemy sub-pods before boarding. Kida almost hacked up her lungs as she crawled ashore, Milo dashing to her aid. \"Kida, we gotta get out of here!\" Milo sputtered, helping Kida to her feet. \"Vinny's rigged the whole place to blow!\" \"No hurry, Milo,\" Vinny drawled, he and Audrey carrying an unconscious Dr. Sweet between them. \"I told you it was just a precaution. The bombs shouldn't go off unless-\" One of the enemy sub-pods turned, launching a small fiery missile that landed somewhere in the rear of the grotto. The whole structure began to rumble as the last of the enemy sub-pods dived beneath the waters. \"Okay, now we should hurry.\" [-] Sub-Pod 3 \"Uuugh,\" groaned Dr. Sweet, clutching his skull as he sat in the cramped rear of the sub-pod. \"What hit me?\" \"Oh, I'd say 'bout five, maybe six thousand volts?\" Vinny pointed. \"Guy who did it's in onna those.\" Though the glass cockpit, Sweet could make out three dark shapes speeding through the water ahead of them. Audrey hit the accelerator, rapidly narrowing the gap between them and their quarry. \"Got you now, you two-faced perra! \" A fourth shape emerged from the darkness ahead, dwarfing the sub-pods with its immense bulk; a long, sleek predatory shape. The overlapping black-iron plates of its hull were like the scales of a prehistoric marine reptile. Its portholes glimmered an eerie greenish-blue, like the eyes of a sea-serpent, and its prow tapered into a vicious lance. Dr. Sweet's eyes widened. \"Lord… Please tell me I'm still sleeping.\" [-] Sub-Pod 2 \"I can't believe it! It's just like in the book!\" Milo babbled. \"Well I mean the one in the book a lot smaller, and waaaay less mean looking but it has to be!?\" \"Milo, what is it?!\" Kida implored. \"It's…\" [-] The Nautilus \"Captain on deck!\" the First Mate barked. Nemo strode into the control room, followed by her command crew, taking her seat upon an ornate throne. \"Helm set course for the open Atlantic, full speed. This bay has become too… confining for my tastes.\" \"Aye, Captain,\" responded the muscular Hawaiian woman standing by the wheel, her hair bushy and uniform disheveled. Her eyes darted about the chamber. \"Where's Sha?\" \"Sha fell into the enemy's hands,\" the First Mate answered. \"And we're just going to leave him!?\" the Helmswoman snapped back. \"That's enough, Leialoha!\" Nemo admonished, before releasing a deep sigh. \"Sha survived the Mechiya massacre, he'll survive this. He would expect us to do the same.\" \"Aye, Captain,\" the Helmswoman conceded sadly, turning the wheel. \"Taking her out.\" \"Captain? I have something closing on an intercept course,\" spoke an aged balding Pole bent over the sonar station, his long thin beard training half-way to the ground. \"It's the Americans' ship!\" [-] S.S. Atlantean Captain Magnus Mantell didn't really consider himself a part of what Mr. Whitmore colorfully called 'Team Atlantis', or as Mantell privately thought of them; 'that roving band of feckless lunatics'. He preferred to think of himself as a simple ferryman. Take the passengers where they wanted, wait at a safe distance for them to finish stirring up whatever deviltry they happened to stumble on this week, and collect them afterward on the odd chance they happened to survive. Mantell was no coward, he'd faced death a thousand times during the Great War, but he was of old Orkney Islands stock. His early childhood had been one long dark night filled with his mother's wild tales of the skinless Nuckelavee, rapacious selkies, and other horrors. He feared no material foe, but any hint of Krakens, sea-devils or the occult struck him with a spiritual dread. So when Thatch had radioed just a few moments ago, he'd almost been relieved. He hadn't been able to make out all the details from the linguist's babbling, but a heavily armed rogue U-boat manned by pirates and fanatics was a foe Captain Mantell could understand. And any foe that could be understood could be beaten. [-] The Nautilus Nemo flicked a switch along the arm of her throne, opening a com to the engine room. \"Axel, how long to charge the Nullifier?\" \"Five minutes, maybe four if I cut corners, but there's a risk of permanently burning it out,\" replied the static tinged voice of the engineer. \"Understood, you have two.\" [-] S.S. Atlantean \"Mrs. Packard, ETA 'til we intercept the enemy sub?\" Mantell demanded. \"You're gonna reuse your old wedding dress?\" Packard droned. \"Margie hunny, that's not a good idea.\" \"PACKARD!?\" \"Gimme a sec, Margie,\" Packard droned. \"ETA One minute, thirty seconds!\" [-] The Nautilus \"One minute, twenty seconds!\" Axel's voice crackled through the com. [-] S.S. Atlantean \"Thirty seconds!\" Packard rasped. \"Ready depth-charges!\" Mantell bellowed. [-] The Nautilus \"Nullifier fully charged, Captain!\" The corner of Nemo's lips curled upwards. \"Fire.\" [-] S.S. Atlantean \"On my mark, drop charges… N-\" Mantell barked, as every light on the bridge suddenly flickered and died. \"What happened?!\" he demanded, scrambling through the darkened bridge. Packard experimentally smacked the inert block that been a working console just a few seconds ago. \"Beats me.\" Mantell raced out onto the deck, just in time to watch an eerie green-blue glow pass beneath the hull and out into the open waters of the wide Atlantic. [-] Sub-Pod 2 \"NO, NO NO!\" Kida roared, beating the inert controls. Watching in futile horror as the sub-pod groaned to a halt, the dense water sapping its inertia. A dark chuckle filtered from the back of the cockpit. \"What the Hell is so funny?\" Milo demanded, turning on the Nautilus crewman bound in the rear of the sub-pod. \"You,\" the crewman sneered. \"The Great Powers have hunted the Captain for almost a century, yet you thought to succeed where they failed? With what, a handful of miscreants and two tiny sub-pods?\" \"We have not failed yet,\" Kida swore. \"Oh, don't delude yourself,\" the crewman snorted. \"The Captain has all the waters of the Earth to hide in! What's more; she's smarter than you, smarter than anyone! But go on, trawl the seas 'til the Day of Judgement for all the good it will-\" Kida spun around, grabbing the crewman by the throat as she drew her dagger. \"Kida, STOP!\" Milo cried, throwing himself around her arm. \"Please… he's not worth it.\" Kida glared at her captive for a long silent moment… before tossing him back to the floor and sheathing her blade. She stared out into the cold, empty Deep. \"We… we need to talk to Ned.\" [-] Bantry Bay The rain pelted mournfully upon the grimy window pane of the old stone cottage as the pale light of dawn filtered through. Ned O'Malley sobbed uncontrollably into the arms of Molly the barmaid, who glared accusingly at what she considered the source of Ned's grief. Across the room sat at a respectful distance, sat Kida, Milo, Audrey, Vinny and Dr. Sweet. Each was silent. After what seemed an eternity, Kida stepped forward. \"Ned… I…\" Knock knock. \"I'll get that,\" Milo offered, eager for something, anything, to do. No sooner had he opened the door then a small figure blurred past him, throwing its bony arms about Ned. \"DADDY!\" cried a human child with a mop of unruly red hair, no older than twelve and clad in a ridiculously oversized greatcoat of ebon-blue. \"MUIREANN!? OH, THANK GOD, HIS BLESSED MOTHER, AND ALL THE SAINTS ABOVE!\" Ned cried, swinging his daughter about his head, laughing and crying. \"But… how…?\" \"She asked me to give you this,\" Muireann spoke, drawing a thick envelope from the recesses of the oversized greatcoat. Ned gingerly tore open the envelope, allowing three large gold coins to clang heavily to the floor. \"Wow,\" Vinny drawled, bending over. \"Those are Spanish doubloons. You could buy like half a whaling boat with those, maybe three quarters, A third at least.\" Ned drew a thin page of strangely greenish tinted paper from the envelope, handing it to Milo with some embarrassment. \"Could you…? I… can't really…\" \"Oh, oh… of course,\" Milo nodded before he began reading out loud… My dear Mr. O'Malley, I owe you and young Muireann the most abject of apologies. It was never my intention that your family become causalities in our struggle against the Great Powers. When I first happened upon Muireann, her injuries were far too severe for conventional medicine. In haste and desperation, I was forced to rely on science beyond my understanding. In doing so, I saved the child's life almost at the cost of her humanity. In her uncomprehending terror, Muireann fled before the process could be reversed. Yet I could not return to the open Deep without first setting right what I myself had put wrong. I pray these few coins will serve as some small recompense for the pain I inadvertently caused you both. Your friend and ally, Captain Nemo. Milo let the letter fall to the floor, catching sight of Kida slipping out the front door as the rest of the team crowded about the happily reunited family. \"Could you give me a sec?\" [-] Kida stood on the shore with arms crossed, letting the foam lap her boots. \"Muireann would never have been in any danger if Nemo had not been looting Atlantean artifacts to begin with.\" \"Maybe,\" Milo conceded as he joined her. \"Before, in the grotto. You sounded as though you recognized the name?\" \"Sorta,\" answered Milo. \"The original Captain Nemo was a fictional character created by Jules Verne. He was an Indian Prince who invented an advanced submarine to escape the injustices of the surface world and wage war on the empire that invaded his homeland. I guess this Nemo is a fan.\" Kida gazed out over the cold grey waves, thinking about her own homeland, lost to her... somewhere in the Deep. \"Of course!\" Milo smacked his forehead. \"Nemo is a contraction of the Latin 'ne homo' which literally mean 'no man'!\" Kida arched an eyebrow. \"'Cuz she's a woman, you see?\" Milo mumbled. \"It's kind of a pun or double entendre.\" Kida smiled, ruffling his chestnut hair. \"Never ever change, Milo.\" [-] The Nautilus , Somewhere beneath the Atlantic Ocean Nemo sat in the grand salon, clad simply in leather boots, dark blue breeches, and a plain white undershirt. Before her, a vast iris-like window opened to reveal all the glories of the Deep. In one hand, a cigar smoldered. In the other, she held a small leather-bound volume that commanded her complete attention. Someone coughed softly. She looked up to meet the gaze of her First Mate, standing attentively by the entrance. \"Yes, Number One?\" she spoke. \"Axel and Leialoha are almost finished cataloging the artifacts salvaged in Ireland,\" said the First Mate. \"They should be ready for inspection within the hour.\" \"Very good,\" Nemo replied. The First Mate tilted his head slightly. \" The Antediluvian World by Ignatius Donnelly?\" \"It owes more to fancy than history,\" Nemo snorted. \"But Donnelly was perhaps more right than he knew.\" \"This is about that woman back in the grotto, isn't it?\" \"Over ten millennia ago, the Atlanteans held half this world under their boot. If that girl really is what she claims, if she truly is the heir to the Lost Empire... then I can think of only one reason why she would seek the relics of Atlantis.\" Nemo snapped the tome shut, rising to gaze out the great window. Cyclopean ruins stretched out upon the seabed, bathed in the dull red glow of a submerged volcano. She took a long deep drag on the cigar, wreathing her visage in smoke. \"I have not spent a century loosening the Great Powers' grip upon this world only to hand it off to yet another tyrant,\" she rasped. Beneath her white undershirt, something pulsed briefly with a pale blue glow. \"For the future of this world, for the liberty of generations unborn… Kidagakash Nedakh must die.\" Never The End…[Chapter 4] [-] Featuring the voice talents of...

I've been sitting on this story for a while. I've had it written in a Word document for a long time. Normally, I would keep it to myself, but I came to realize that there are essentially no My Big Fat Greek Wedding fanfictions out there! I found that to be unacceptable, so I decided to offer my own. Let it be known that all rights and such belong to Nia Vardalos and the creators/producers of the MBFGW story. I own nothing! This is my own spin on some feels-inducing events that could take place after the end of the second movie. Enjoy, and don't hesitate to leave comments! Thank you for reading. Toula went into the doctor's office for her routine check-up. Since Paris had gone off to NYU, she had to force herself to look forward to appointments, errands, and other trivial events. Nothing else would keep her occupied. It wasn't anything new or different, just a weigh-in, height measurement, hearing test, mammogram. She went through the motions blandly, going through checklists in her mind. She needed to stop by the grocery soon. She needed to retrieve her wallet from the family restaurant. She had accidentally left it there. Oh, and how could she forget? Ian called earlier, asking her out on a date. She couldn't help but grin at the memory. He made it feel like old times again, calling and asking permission to have dinner or go see a movie. It was just like when they first met. Toula pondered what she would wear that evening. She wanted to look nice for her husband, so perhaps she would don that black skirt she bought awhile back, and the sleek gold shirt that was somewhere deep in her closet. She responded to the calling of her name, heading in the back room to discuss the results with her doctor. Her mind wandered as she sat down and offered a polite smile. \"Hello, Toula,\" Dr. Reese greeted. She gave a tight grin in return. \"I wanted to talk to you about your test results.\" \"Before you get into your spiel, I know.\" The patient raised her hands in lighthearted surrender. \"I cheated. I gained a couple of pounds because I couldn't resist dessert.\" The doctor flicked her eyes down on her desk, stiffened, then raised her gaze to meet Toula's. \"That's quite alright. You don't have to worry about that.\" Toula nodded appreciatively. Dr. Reese took a deep breath. \"However, this is about your mammogram.\" The friendly expression fell from Toula's face while her heart quickened its pace. It suddenly became nearly impossible to swallow. \"In the images, it seems we've found two lumps. One in each breast.\" Dr. Reese's tone was grim. Toula felt her hands begin to tremble. Her shallow breaths rattled in her chest. \"I truly regret to inform you that you have developed breast cancer.\" Her ears were ringing loudly. Her eyes were shut. After ages, Toula spoke shakily. \"What?\" There was an unbelievable amount of despair in that one word. \"I know this is a shock. I'm so sorry, Toula,\" Dr. Reese sympathized. \"But- I don't understand. It doesn't run in my family.\" She was in denial. \"It doesn't have to run in your family for you to get it.\" \"Wh- what could have caused this?\" The Greek woman felt like she couldn't breathe. \"This isn't your fault. Sometimes cells are just mutated, and they start growing uncontrollably.\" Toula stood abruptly. Why? She wasn't sure. \"I know this isn't my fault,\" she said severely. \"Please. I know you're upset. But we can fight this.\" Dr. Reese stood too, taking her patient's hand. \"It's Stage 2, which is far from the worst.\" Toula pulled away slowly. She backed up, stumbling. \"I have cancer?\" she whispered faintly, tears filling her eyes. She pressed a hand over her quivering mouth and fell against the wall, sliding to the floor. She sat there, defeated, and cried.[Chapter 2] Ian tapped his foot, bouncing his leg rapidly. He checked his watch again. He scanned the restaurant, seeking out his wife. She still wasn't there. He straightened up, readjusting his crisp sport coat. He anxiously smoothed down his hair and let out a sigh, trying not to get mad. Ian practiced shrugging it off. He grinned the tiniest bit, knowing that the time always got away from Toula. He couldn't blame her. That's just how she was. Ah! At long last, there she was. The tall man jumped up excitedly, smiling at her. He pulled out her chair, gesturing for her to sit. \"And how is my personal Greek statue tonight?\" \"I'm sorry I'm late, E,\" she apologized softly. \"Don't worry about it.\" He shook his head, and unconditional love gushed from his eyes. He cleared his throat. \"You look very nice. I like that shirt on you.\" Toula gave a short, curt nod. Her stare bored into the table. \"Hey.\" Ian knit his eyebrows together, reaching over and grasping her hand warmly. \"What's going on?\" His soothing voice never failed to make Toula weak. She turned her head away and closed her eyes, squeezing his hand tightly. \"Something happened today, Ian.\" Her voice wavered. \"You can tell me.\" Concern creased his face. \"I went to the doctor today, and, um… she-\" Toula hitched in a breath. \"She told me that I have Stage 2 breast cancer.\" Her husband blanched and his grip on her hand slackened. The fear and sadness in his expression broke Toula instantly. Tears dripped down her cheeks and she let out a tiny sob. Somewhat panicked, Ian leapt out of his chair and hurried around the small table, wrapping Toula in a fierce hug. She pressed her fingers into his back and cried into his chest while he fought the stinging in his eyes and rested his chin on top of her head. His mind was racing at hundreds of miles per hour. He bent his neck down so that he could whisper into his wife's left ear. \"I'm so sorry,\" he murmured in shock. Ian cradled the back of Toula's head with one of his hands. She shuddered in his arms. \"But we're going to get through this, okay?\" He had newfound resolve. There was no way he was going to lose her. \"I'm scared,\" she admitted unevenly. \"I'm so scared.\" \"Listen to me. You're so strong, and you're going to have your entire family to back you up. They're going to help take care of you. And I'm going to take care of you, too.\" Ian gently wiped the tears from her cheeks and kissed her forehead. \"I ruined our date night.\" \"No way. Come on, let's get out of here. We don't need to be on a date to be together. You'll be more comfortable at home.\" He took her hand and squeezed it reassuringly, leading the way out of the restaurant. While she wasn't looking, Ian brushed away the tears in his eyes. He had to be strong for her.[Chapter 3] \"How are we going to tell the family?\" Ian asked a couple of days later. He and Toula were sitting on the couch together, holding hands, watching TV. \"Should we do it one-on-one?\" A brief laugh bubbled from her throat. It was nice. He hadn't heard her laugh in the past few days. \"No way. If we told one person then the rest of the family would know by the time we get to the second person.\" \"You're right,\" Ian nodded. He glanced over at her. \"Are you prepared to tell your entire family, all at once? It'll be intense.\" Toula dropped her head back, not wanting to think about it. Images flashed in her mind: her, standing alone in front of 15+ members of her family; her, getting absolutely swarmed… \"Oh my god!\" Toula jerked upright. \"How are we going to tell Paris?!\" \"Jesus…\" Ian rubbed his forehead and sighed. \"I have no idea.\" \"Why don't…\" she paused. \"Why don't we just not tell anyone?\" Ian stared incredulously. Toula shrugged, trying to make it seem like less of a drastic idea. \"No one needs to know. We can deal with this, just you and me.\" \"Are you crazy ?\" Ian grabbed her head and looked it over, making sure she didn't have a wound that somehow caused brain damage. \"Cut it out,\" Toula wriggled free. \"I'm serious. It's going to be a lot of suffocation and worry and crying. I don't want to deal with it.\" \"You aren't serious. You just think you're being serious. You want to be tough and brave and work this out on your own. We aren't going to do that. I'm sorry, but I'm putting my foot down. We're going to involve the family.\" \"I don't want to tell anyone,\" Toula admitted quietly. \"It's scary and it's sad and it's embarrassing.\" \"You don't actually think you could ever keep this a secret from your family, do you? They'd most definitely find out.\" \" I know. But I just don't want to tell anyone. They're going to… look at me weird.\" She stood and began pacing. \"I mean, damn it Ian! Why me?\" she demanded. \"I- I don't know. I can't tell you why. But it doesn't matter, okay?\" Ian tried to reassure. \"No! It does matter. Because I already had to put up with all of this stupidly insane, stressful stuff, and now I should be off the hook. It's not okay and I don't know if it's going to be okay!\" Toula was shouting at that point. \"Babe…\" Ian held up his arms in surrender. \"I'm sorry.\" So then they decided to tell Paris. The parents sat nervously in front of the laptop, waiting to Skype. \"We've got this,\" Ian muttered, squeezing his wife's knee. \"Paris is mature.\" Toula was squirming. \"No, wait, I can't-\" she made for shutting the laptop, but Ian stopped her hands and held it open. \"Hi mom, hi dad!\" Paris greeted enthusiastically through the somewhat crappy microphone. \"Hi honey,\" Ian smiled, giving her a tiny wave. \"It feels like it's been forever since we've seen you.\" \"Oh, come on guys, it's only been a couple of weeks.\" \"We miss you, honey,\" Toula chimed in. It proved a grueling challenge not to get choked up. \"How's Yia Yia and Pa Pou?\" the daughter wondered. \"Still happily married?\" \"Oh yes, they're doing just fine,\" Ian chuckled. Toula and her husband made eye contact. Should they break it to her now? \"What's up?\" Paris caught on. \"You guys are acting all stiff and weird.\" \"Paris, darling, first of all, we want to say that we're so happy for you. We're so proud. We want you to keep studying and to keep focused, okay?\" \"What is this about?\" she was starting to get paranoid. Through the digital screen, Paris could see tears sparkling in her mother's eyes. \"Your mom is sick,\" Ian confessed. \"What do you mean? Mom? Are you alright?\" \"Honey, don't be scared, okay? Don't worry.\" Toula's voice was thick with emotion. \"We need to tell you… that I have breast cancer.\" Shock and devastation were clear on Paris's face. She slapped a hand over her gaping mouth. Tears welled in her eyes. \" What ?\" she whimpered. \"Wh- when did this happen? Did we not pay close enough attention?\" \"No, no, we couldn't have known. It all happened very quickly, Paris,\" Toula denied. \"Mom, I…\" their daughter's voice broke, and she wiped her eyes. \"I'm sorry. I should come home.\" \"No, honey, you don't have to do that. We'll keep you informed. We won't let anything happen without you knowing about it.\" Ian tried to convince her to stay. They didn't really have the money to scrape together for a plane ticket at that moment. \"We just have to ask one favor: don't tell anyone in the family yet, alright? We're going to tell them tonight when we go over for dinner.\" \"Okay,\" Paris agreed, scrubbing her face of all tears again. \"I… I'm sorry, that I was so bratty to you guys when we were trying to work college stuff out. I'm really sorry. I feel like, if I hadn't stressed you out so much-\" \"Paris, don't you dare think like that!\" Toula ordered. She rarely dusted off her strict voice, but she utilized it for this. \"This is not your fault. And we're going to deal with it. I'm not going anywhere.\" The young girl dipped her head in approval. \"I understand. Now, I have to get to class. But I really love you guys. I love you.\" Paris pressed a hand to the screen and Toula's heart constricted. \"I love you too, sweetheart,\" she said softly. The screen cut to black, and Ian slung his arm around his wife.[Chapter 4] \"Thanks for dinner, Ma, it was really great,\" Toula complimented. \"Oooh, yeah, the seconds and thirds were especially fantastic.\" Nico closed his eyes and held his stomach, grinning. Toula jabbed his side playfully. The two siblings were scrubbing dishes. It was their turn to take care of the family's plates. \"So, how's Paris like New York?\" Nico inquired. \"Oh, she likes it a lot. She sends us pictures of the skylines, and she's going on a little trip to the Statue of Liberty with a couple of friends soon. I'm happy for her, but I just want her to be safe, you know?\" Toula bit her lip. \"Yeah I get it. So is that why you were so quiet during dinner?\" \"I'm always quiet during dinner.\" Toula diverted her gaze. \"I mean, I know New York is a big city and it can be dangerous, but I bet the college campus is very safe. They've probably got their own police unit and whatnot.\" \"Yeah, you're right.\" She shrugged it off. \"So then what are you really upset about?\" Nick pried. He could always read his sister better than anyone. Toula pressed her mouth into a flat line. \"Don't worry about it,\" she shook her head. \"C'mon, you can tell me.\" \"Not right now, Nick.\" \"Aw, sis, I thought I was your confidant.\" \"I'm surprised you even know what 'confidant' means,\" she poked fun, trying to derail the conversation. He clicked his tongue. \"I know you too well, Toula. You can't hide stuff from me.\" \"And I'm not.\" She was getting exasperated. \"I'm going to tell the whole family together. In a few moments. So if you could just keep your pants on until then-\" \"Jeez, you're telling the whole family? What's wrong? Are you and Ian getting a divorce? I swear, do I need to pound his face in?\" \"Nico, god! Calm down. It's none of that. No, Ian and I are good. We're fine. Just wait, okay?\" Her brother heard the pain in her voice and immediately backed down. \"Alright. I got it.\" They finished washing the dishes in silence. Then, the entire family sat down in the living room together. They were all chatting loudly and cackling. Toula sat close to Ian on a couch, poised rigidly. She stared at her feet, avoiding glances that Nick kept shooting her way. Ian rubbed her back affectionately, and she found the courage to stand up. \"Hey, guys,\" she called meekly. \"I've got some… kind of daunting news.\" Toula inhaled deeply, feeling like she was on fire with everyone's eyes on her. \"Is it about Paris?\" Maria questioned. \"Well, no. I don't really know how to, ah, say this, so I'm just going to come right out with it. I was recently diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer.\" And for once, the family was dead silent. Toula wrung her hands. Maria had her hand over her heart. Nikki's eyes were watering. Gus was sputtering, and Nico appeared heartbroken. Aunt Voula stepped forward and embraced her niece. \"Dear child,\" she murmured. She stroked Toula's hair and held her face. \"You have a good husband, and you are strong. Therefore, no thing can hurt you.\" \"Thank you, Aunt Voula.\" Nick barely waited to tackle his sister in a back-breaking hug. \"God, Toula. How could this happen? To you of all people.\" Tears streaked his face as he held her tighter. \"I'm scared too, Nick,\" she answered. \"Hey, anything you need, ask me. Alright? Money, grocery run, foot massage, anything. I won't let you do this on your own.\" \"I got it,\" she nodded appreciatively. Then it was Maria and Gus, Toula's parents. \"My baby…\" Maria's voice shook. \"We're not going to cry, right? No cry. Strong like bull. Good for farm.\" She offered a warm smile to her daughter. \"I know it will be okay.\" Gus apologized profusely and kissed the top of Toula's head. \"You have love and support here. I will always be here for you.\" Then he turned to Ian. \"And you. Since you Greek now, you gotta take good care of my daughter. Eh? I'm… trusting you. Don't mess up.\" \"I won't, sir. You have my word. I love Toula more than anything.\" Ian stepped alongside his wife and wrapped his arm around her shoulders, pulling her close. Toula's expression was a little strangled. She was trying to hold it together. She felt strange. Sick, almost. That feeling like she was on fire hadn't gone away. It was getting to be extremely hot in the living room, but no one else seemed to be uncomfortable. \"Thank you,\" Toula began, her voice sounding muted. She blinked a few times in an attempt to rid her mind of its sudden sluggishness. Her limbs felt leaden. \"I really-\" Then her knees gave out, and she collapsed promptly.[Chapter 5] After Toula had fallen, the family sprang into action. An ambulance arrived at the house in minutes. Ian clambered in back, having every intention to ride to the hospital with his wife. He knelt next to her. She was strapped to a gurney. \"She's burning up,\" one of the paramedics barked grimly. \"Sir,\" the other one faced him. \"Was she showing any signs of discomfort? Did she let on that she was feeling sick at all?\" Ian was pale. He shook his head and swallowed hard. \"Is she going to be make it through?\" \"We need you to give her some space, sir,\" the first paramedic informed strictly. Eventually, they made it to the ER. Toula's breathing was labored and she had lost consciousness. All Ian kept hearing was that she was feverish. It was getting to the deadly range. Somewhere around 105 degrees. They were preparing to take her back into one of the exam rooms, and he would be unable to follow. Though her head had lolled to one side, he could see her fingertips moving the slightest bit. Ian took the chance and enveloped her hand with both of his. He kissed it, his cheeks wet with a few tears. He felt a feeble squeeze in return. Toula's eyes fluttered, and he knew she'd fight to be okay. \"I'll see you soon, my Greek statue,\" he whispered. Another squeeze. Eventually, the entire family arrived. They took up half of the waiting room, all consoling Ian. Nico and Angelo sandwiched their brother-in-law. \"It's all gonna work out,\" they encouraged. Everyone waited there for nearly two hours. Then, a doctor came out to give them information. \"Hello, I'm Dr. Jacobs. You all will be pleased to know that we stabilized Toula and that her fever has gone down two degrees.\" \"Thank god,\" Ian exhaled. \"I take it this little episode came as a surprise,\" he inferred. \"There was a cause for Toula's fever. Because of her cancer, her lymph nodes began swelling. That induced the high temperature.\" \"What can we do to prevent that?\" Nick wondered. \"She needs a lot more rest than she's been getting. You can usually reduce swelling by applying towels that have been soaked in hot water. And she can take pain relievers.\" \"Can we see her?\" Ian asked. He was tired and stressed. \"Yes. She might be awake by now. We've got her on fluids and an IV drip. Just don't let her sit up. She needs to remain still and rest.\" Dr. Jacobs bid them goodbye and directed a nurse to lead the family back. \"I'm sorry, only family members-\" \"We are family!\" Voula snipped, leading the way. \"Yes, ma'am,\" the nurse stammered. Once Ian was by her side, Toula pried her eyelids open. She was exhausted and overheated, but she heard her husband's voice and wanted to give him some response. \"Hey.\" He gently caressed her cheek. \"How ya doing?\" \"Crappy,\" she croaked. \"My armpits hurt.\" \"Those are your lymph nodes. The doctor told us they're swollen, and that's what caused your fever.\" Ian tucked a lock of hair behind her ear. \"Were you feeling bad at the house and you just didn't tell me?\" Toula bobbed her head weakly. \"I should have told you. I'm sorry.\" Her voice was raspy. \"I didn't want to think anything of it, though. But I guess this thing is starting now,\" she said in reference to her cancer. \"I'm scared.\" A tear leaked out of her eye. \"I don't want to go through this.\" \"I know. It's going to be hard. But we're going to make it through, I promise you that.\" \"Did anyone let Paris know what's going on?\" Toula queried. Everyone shook their heads. \"Damn,\" Ian moaned. He really didn't want to worry his daughter, but they couldn't keep her uninformed. \"Maybe we should wait until morning,\" he proffered after checking his watch. \"What time is it?\" \"Almost 12:30. It's kind of late right now.\" \"You're right,\" Toula conceded. They would call their daughter in the morning, when Toula could talk to her without sounding so ill. The family exchanged hugs and all of the members left the hospital except for Nico and Ian. \"Hey, man, you don't have to stay,\" Ian slapped him on the back, telling him he could go home. \"Yeah I do.\" He said it simply. Matter-of-factly. \"Of course I have to stay. Otherwise my sister will cause trouble.\" He winked. \"Well, it'll be good to have company.\" Ian thanked him, and they made their sleeping arrangements: one on a small couch, the other in a reclining chair in the corner. Toula was so drained, she was out like a light.[Chapter 6] I figured I should remind you all that I do not own My Big Fat Greek Wedding 1 or 2. I do not own any of the characters or storylines mentioned. This is my own take on what could happen after the timeline of the second movie. I love these characters and their stories, and (just a reminder) I couldn't stand that there was no fanfiction written about these movies. So, \"there you go.\" ;) All rights and respect to Nia Vardalos, the mastermind and creator of these movies and wonderful characters. No copyright infringement intended! Please enjoy and know that you are welcome to comment. Nurses disturbed their sleep periodically throughout the night. They came in to check on Toula's fever at varying intervals, to make sure it wasn't increasing. Finally, Ian awoke. Bright sunlight was streaming in his eyes, and he had a crick in his neck. The couch had been a little too short for him. He turned his head, not seeing Nico in the recliner. Instead, Toula's brother was at her side. He gripped her hand and was humming some Greek hymn while she slept. Ian swung his legs down and sat up, stretching. He had hoped last night was all a bad dream. No such luck. Then he checked his watch, remembering that they needed to call Paris. 9:30 a.m. He had slept in. \"Hey, buddy,\" Nick spun around in the wheeled chair. \"I got some breakfast food from the cafeteria a bit ago. No worries, I got you this little fruit salad thing, Mr. Vegetarian.\" \"Thanks, man. You already ate?\" \"Yeah,\" Nico nodded. \"Toula's not awake yet,\" Ian noted. \"Nah. One of the nurses'll be coming in soon, though. That should wake her up.\" \"How can we tell Paris without scaring her?\" Ian fretted. The brother-in-law bit his lip. \"Uh. Don't tell her?\" he offered. \"I wish.\" A short nurse with black hair hurried in their room. \"Good morning,\" she smiled politely. \"Morning,\" Ian and Nico greeted groggily. The nurse tended to Toula's IV drip and brought in a tray of food, then touched the patient's arm. \"Ma'am?\" she murmured. \"How are you feeling today?\" Toula groaned as she situated herself, running her fingers through her hair. She rubbed the sleep out of her eyes. \"What?\" \"How are you feeling?\" \"I still feel hot. And a little nauseous. But not nearly as bad as last night.\" \"That's very good!\" the small nurse congratulated kindly. \"Would you like orange juice, or water?\" Toula cringed and wrinkled her nose. \"Water. Please.\" Ian approached his wife when the nurse left. \"Hey, babe.\" He flashed a smile. \"Hi.\" Toula pushed away the trolley that the tray of food came on. She was disinterested. \"Oh, why don't we call Paris now? I don't sound sick, right Nick?\" \"Nope. You sound just fine.\" The couple called their daughter, putting her on speaker phone. \"Dad?\" Paris answered, yawning. \"What's up? Is something wrong?\" \"Hey, honey!\" Toula answered enthusiastically. It was tiring her out just to sound upbeat. \"Oh, hi mom,\" Paris amended her salutation. \"I'm here too, sweetheart,\" Ian chimed in. \"Okay…\" They could tell Paris was still waking up. \"Paris, we wanted to keep you in the loop, so we figured this update was necessary. Don't be scared; nothing's wrong.\" \"Besides Mom having cancer,\" she pointed out, upset. \"Well… yes,\" Toula swallowed with difficulty. Ian took over. \"Last night your mother had a very high fever. There was some swelling in her lymph nodes, so we had to get her checked out. But her fever has gone down, and things are going alright.\" They heard their daughter sigh miserably. \"I feel like I should be there,\" she admitted. \"I feel guilty that you guys are doing this alone.\" \"Honey, please try not to worry. Please. We need you to keep working and keep your scholarship. The holidays are coming soon and you can see us then, okay?\" Paris submitted, but she wasn't too happy about it. She was anxious to see her parents, healthy and happy. But they were right. No way could she stay at NYU without maintaining her scholarship. \"Trust us, okay Paris?\" Ian implored. \"This is going to work out. We'll be in touch. We love you.\"[Chapter 7] A day went by, and Toula's fever was gone. The swelling had decreased drastically. Dr. Reese came in for a status report. \"Hey there,\" she greeted. \"How are you feeling, Toula?\" \"A lot better. A lot stronger, too,\" she said positively. \"That's wonderful news. We need you to be a strong as possible.\" She clutched a clipboard close to her chest. \"I'm thinking… we should probably schedule your surgery. Soon.\" Ian walked over and sat on the hospital bed beside his wife. \"Okay,\" Toula agreed slowly. She wanted this to be done as soon as possible, but she simultaneously didn't want to face it at all. \"I know that Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming up, and I know you'll want to be home for that. So what do you think about in… two weeks?\" \"Two weeks?\" Her heart thumped loudly. \"You're scared. I understand. But we can't delay, or else the cancer might grow or spread.\" The muscles in Ian's jaw tightened. He stared at Toula. \"What do you think?\" she asked him softly. \"I don't want to rush you, but I think two weeks will be best. Otherwise I'm going to worry the whole time, and I know you. You'll worry too.\" \"Toula will worry either way,\" Nick commented. \"She's always been a downer,\" he joked lightly. \"What can you tell me about the surgery?\" she inquired. Dr. Reese straightened up. \"I can tell you that it's going to be an easy surgery. I'm coordinating with a doctor who's done this procedure a thousand times. He has the most experience with Stage 2 cancer. And, there shouldn't be any need for reconstructive surgery afterwards.\" She offered a small smile. \"We're going to take care of you, Toula.\" \"Alright. See you in two weeks, then,\" the patient confirmed. \"Don't worry. You'll be home and healing by the time the holidays come around.\" \"Sounds like a plan,\" Ian supported. He stood and shook Dr. Reese's hand. \"Thanks.\" \"See you in two weeks,\" she nodded confidently. Two weeks passed quickly. They told Paris about the day of the surgery, and they informed the family too. Suddenly, it was the night before, and Toula was trying to keep calm. She ate dinner with Ian in their quiet house. She was on the edge of her seat, tense, nerves high-strung. Afterward, they went to bed early. She would need the rest. \"I'm going to brush my teeth, okay?\" Toula stated tersely. Ian flopped back onto the bed and closed his eyes. \"'Kay.\" Hurriedly, the anxious woman shut herself inside the bathroom. She placed her hand on her chest, feeling her heart race. Toula gripped the counter top. She ran the faucet so Ian wouldn't think anything was wrong. Then, Toula hugged herself and sat down hard on the floor. She shuddered. There was a buzzing on the counter. It was her phone. \"Hello?\" Toula answered. \"Mom?\" Paris replied tearfully. \"Hey honey.\" Toula leaned back against the bathroom wall. \"Why are you crying?\" \"I'm scared for you,\" the daughter admitted. \"I want to be there with you.\" \"I know sweetheart. I'm scared too.\" She laughed instead of sobbing, which surprised her. \"I'll tell Aunt Voula to keep you on FaceTime, so you can be there.\" \"Okay,\" Paris giggled, though her voice was still thick with emotion. \"Do you- do you trust your doctors? Are they the best ones possible?\" \"Yes. Yes, they are. They said they're going to take care of me. And I'll be home to see you over break.\" \"That's good. I'm going to be the first one off that plane. I'll fight any old people who get in the way.\" They both broke into laughter. The mother and daughter listened to the silence for a moment. \"I'll call you tomorrow, before the surgery. And I'll see you right before you go in, if Aunt Voula succeeds in figuring out the technology.\" \"That sounds perfect,\" Toula grinned. \"I love you,\" Paris said with urgency. \"I love you too. I love you so much, sweetheart. Now get some sleep.\" They hung up.[Chapter 8] She knew she should have been nervous. And she was. There was a tightness in her chest. But after worrying and being nervous for so long, everything almost receded the day of the surgery. Toula's limbs felt numb. She wasn't sure how she was walking. She wasn't sure how she was holding her husband's hand when she couldn't even feel her arm. Paris called that morning. It was well before the surgery. \"Did you stay up all night?\" Toula fussed. \"I couldn't get to sleep,\" the daughter admitted. \"I'm not tired.\" But now, they were at the hospital. The whole family was. It was like Toula was the President of the United States and her family was the Secret Service; they swarmed her, escorting her to the prep room. It was a long walk. Dr. Reese met the crowd of people in a polite, friendly manner. The atmosphere was heavy, but everyone was trying to stay positive. \"Alright, Toula. We're going to get you situated and then you'll be off. We'll be starting very soon, so it's best to get all the hugs and kisses in now. We'll need you nice and sanitary,\" the female doctor gave a half smile. The family members took their turns, gracing Toula with a minimum of three hugs each. Her parents clung to her and nodded, offering strength and support. Nico worked hard to keep tears from falling. He didn't want to make it seem like a funeral march. Aunt Voula held up an iPad, displaying Paris on the screen. \"Hi everybody,\" the young girl waved. \"Hi Mom.\" \"Hi honey.\" \"You look good in polka dots.\" The room filled with laughter. \"Paris, I love you so much. Okay?\" Toula blinked a couple of times. \"I think they're starting the first round of drugs.\" There was a lengthy pause. \"Whoaaa.\" \"You feeling alright?\" Ian touched her shoulder. \"Yeah just… kind of sluggish. And relaxed.\" Ian laughed, and Toula soaked in that wonderful sound. \"Good. You've been a little uptight this morning.\" Dr. Reese entered along with a few other nurses and surgeons. \"I'm going to have to ask you all to step out into the hallway. We're ready to begin.\" She was authoritative and projected her voice well. \"Mom, I love you. Good luck. You're tough enough for this.\" Paris's tone was frantic. She needed her mother to know that she loved her more than anything. \"Paris, sweetheart, you are so beautiful,\" Toula admired with slightly glazed eyes. \"I don't know how you got to be so beautiful.\" The Portokalos family streamed out of the prep room, clumped together outside of the waiting area. They would dominate that space once they sent their beloved Toula off. Around ten minutes later, the doctors and surgeons were wheeling the hospital bed out. Ian jogged alongside, giving his wife reassuring smiles. \"I'll see you in a few hours. Have a nice nap,\" he grinned. \"I love you.\" Toula stared adoringly, but she was no longer in a comprehensive headspace. She knew he was saying loving things, but it just floated in one ear and went out the other. Then, the anesthesia kicked in.[Chapter 9] I do apologize for this chapter being so short, but it is being paired with another lengthier one, so have no fear! I am so immensely thankful for those of you who are reading the story! Thank you for requesting more. It warms my heart. It took Aunt Voula some time to get Paris to stop crying. She sat in the far corner of the waiting area, to keep the girl's tears somewhat private. As badly as Paris wanted to be consoled, she wouldn't dare reveal her greatest fears. If she spoke them out loud, they could become real. But she was afraid. She was broken by the last words her mother said. Toula said she was beautiful. Paris was petrified that those might be the last words her mother said to her. They had been reassured time and time again that it was a quick, precise procedure. However, things go wrong in the simplest of surgeries. It could be anesthesia, it could be a doctor's mistake… And those would be the last words. Not that they were bad. They were wonderful, affectionate compliments. But she couldn't bear the thought of her mother dying after being so unconditionally kind. Paris needed to return the praise, or it needed to be counteracted by her mother yelling at her to clean her room, or something along those lines. Of course she couldn't tell Aunt Voula anything like that. So she didn't say anything. She just waited until her tears subsided and she could control her gasping lungs. And she waited for the surgery to be over.[Chapter 10] Finally, Thanksgiving had arrived. And with it, Paris. She was picked up from the airport by Nico and Angelo, who excitedly delivered her to the main Portokalos household. And once she was there, the feast could begin. Paris was halted at the door, crushed by hugs and smothered in kisses. She welcomed the display of affection, feeling oddly neglected and isolated during her time and NYU thus far. True, that was normal, but it was somewhat lonely for her since she had grown up knowing such fierce, passionate, enveloping, familial love all her life. Once she had gotten past the mob of people, though, there was only one family member she desperately wanted to see. \"Toula is upstairs, resting,\" cousin Nikki informed, gripping Paris' shoulder. \"Paris!\" Ian's voice boomed from across the living room. \"My sweet girl.\" He held his daughter tightly, then relinquished his grasp so she could go to her mother. So she trudged upstairs, poking her head in each room. She found Toula in her old room at the family house. \"Mom?\" Toula stirred and winced, sitting up. Then she sucked in a breath. Her eyes instantly teared up, and she reached her hand out. \"Paris,\" she whispered, her voice wavering. \"I feel like I haven't seen you in years,\" the daughter murmured. She hugged her mother gently, for fear of causing her discomfort. \"How are you feeling?\" \"I really do feel good. The doctors say I'm healing quickly, which they find impressive. There's a bit of pain and soreness, but that's usually just when I have to sit up after laying flat.\" The mother and daughter talked for a long time, until Pa Pou had to come up and retrieve them. Everyone was itching to start eating, as always. At the table, it was crowded and loud. Just the way the family liked it. \"So Paris, are there a lot of cute guys at NYU?\" Nikki inquired nosily. \"Oh, I don't know.\" Paris shrank down. She loved her family, but they always wanted to know about her love life. \"I don't see too many people consistently. Just passing on the way to class.\" \"Good answer,\" Nico mouthed, winking. Paris thought it was pretty sneaky of her to turn the subject to classes, instead of boys. \"Oh, Ma, I got you a pair of shoes that were on sale,\" Athena mentioned. \"I don't know if they're going to fit, but we can return them if you don't like them.\" Side conversations erupted all around, Pa Pou grilling Paris about her courses, Angelo joking with Ian about a recent football game, Nico messing with his nephews by kicking them under the table, Gus's mother shouting something at Athena from the kitchen. Nico's sons were bickering over the origins of the word 'iPhone.' Everything was as it should be. After seconds and thirds, the Thanksgiving dinner concluded. An hour or two of more socializing went by, and then each family member retreated to their respective houses. Ian, Toula, and Paris contentedly returned to their home. They all sat in the living room together, Paris filling them in on all that had happened at college so far. \"So, are there actually no boys in the picture right now?\" Toula just had to ask. \"No, Mom, there aren't any.\" Paris shook her head and giggled. \"I've been hanging out with my roommate a lot, though, and she introduced me to some of her friends. We go out every Friday to a different pizza place in search of the best pizza in New York.\" \"What a commendable mission,\" Ian chuckled. \"Yeah, and we walk so much . Like, the first two weeks, my legs were killing me! I've probably got great calves now.\" The small family of three talked and laughed forever. Paris covered a ton of topics, ranging from her zany Philosophy professor to one time when a hobo was cartwheeling on the streets of Manhattan to a cab driver who didn't know how to get her group of friends to the Empire State Building. \"Well, it sounds like you've been having some amazing adventures, honey,\" Toula couldn't help but smile at all of these wonderful experiences. Paris spoke about college extremely enthusiastically, her eyes bright and sparkling. She loved learning, just like her mother. \"I'm still not really sure what I want to focus on and major in, but I think I'll narrow it down by the end of the school year.\" \"We're so proud of you, Paris,\" Ian admired. \"Thank you for being so strong and so determined. It's really helped us out.\" Their daughter blushed at the compliment. She was trying hard. \"Enough about me. How are you guys? Has recovery been tough?\" \"No,\" Toula explained truthfully. \"Your father has been such a good sport, getting me anything I need, changing my bandages, fluffing my pillows.\" \"That's me, nurse extraordinaire,\" Ian grinned. \"You've got bandages?\" \"Yes, just until my chest heals completely. I've got these big, adhesive bandage squares and then I wrap gauze around my chest on top of those. It's not glamorous, but it beats wearing a bra,\" Toula joked. \"Your mother sometimes has some aches and pains, but other than that she's been healthy. We do some exercises that help loosen up the torso and keep her muscles from getting too stiff or weak. But yeah, that's all we've been doing. Sitting around the house and twisting our bodies.\" Ian folded his hands in his lap and leaned back, getting a bit tired. \"Oh, wow, it's late! I'm sorry I kept you guys up telling you all of these stories,\" Paris apologized guiltily. \"Sweetheart, don't even worry. We loved hearing everything that's been going on,\" Toula nodded. \"But we should be asleep. We have to enjoy as much of the holidays as we can.\" And they did. They walked along the shore of Lake Michigan, like they used to when Paris was very young. They went shopping at the mall and purchased some necessities that she could take back to college, like toilet paper and toothpaste. They went to the movie theater and strolled around in local parks. There was much less arguing now that they lived apart.[Chapter 11] It wasn't long until Christmastime. The day of, there was a gigantic family gathering and exchanging of gifts. Some of the kids got little teddy bears that sang in Greek and recited the alphabet. Paris got more necessities, like hairbands and socks and good, strong boots to make her constant walking more comfortable. Other gifts were passed out, like hairspray for Nikki and some bright, colorful jewelry for Aunt Voula. Paris curiously scanned the area for her parents. It was a crowded house and she hadn't been able to find them anywhere. Pa Pou's mother shuffled alongside the teenager. \"Have you seen my mom and dad?\" Paris wondered. The hunched old woman shook her head, then smiled and patted Paris's cheek. What Toula hadn't told anyone was that she would be receiving her results that day. A week or two after her surgery, she had gone in for a scan, and the doctors were supposed to be calling her with the news now. She was holed up in a back room, crouched on the floor, staring at her phone. Ian found his daughter, slinging an arm around her shoulders and offering a chocolate chip cookie. \"Hey kid, you seen your mother?\" he investigated. \"No, I'm looking for her too!\" \"She's going to miss the baklava,\" Ian returned in a mock worried tone. \"Why don't you grab a seat at the table? Dessert's going to be served soon. I'll find Mom.\" Paris obliged, settling in at the extended dinner table while Ian followed a hunch and crept sneakily down a hall into one of the back rooms. \"Toula,\" he whispered, sidling through the doorway. \"Have they-\" In that instant, her phone began ringing. She threw a frightened glance over her shoulder, concern shining in her eyes. Her husband gave her a reassuring nod, though his chest was tight and he was holding his breath. He tried to act cool, calm, and collected for her. Toula tossed her hair back and pressed her cell phone to her ear. \"Hello?\" she answered unsteadily. Ian listened to the soft, steady murmur of the doctor on the other end. He couldn't make out words, but he paid attention. He stepped closer to Toula as she rose from the floor, nodding and saying \"okay\" about a hundred times. Her back was to Ian, her shoulders tense. It was a short call. Another minute or so went by, then she hung up. \"So?\" Ian pried, leaning over to try and catch a glimpse of her expression. \"What's the verdict?\" Toula let out a breath. \" Shit! \" she snarled, hot tears of rage rising in her eyes. She hurled her phone onto the ground and it broke into three pieces. She stalked up to a dresser and kicked it repeatedly. She ran her fingers through her hair and knocked an empty bedside table to the floor. \"God damn it! \" she hissed, her hands trembling as her blood boiled. Toula shook her head at the ground, then brought her murderous glare up to meet Ian's fearful gaze. \"They didn't get all of it,\" she stated stiffly, breathing heavily. Her anger started to crumble and he could see the devastation surfacing. \"I have to go through the surgery again, and this time they want to do chemotherapy after.\" Ian stared, heartbroken. He reached his arm out in an attempt to close the gap between them. \"I still have cancer,\" Toula whimpered miserably. Instead of meeting Ian in a hug, she fell to her knees and dropped her face in her hands. ","Summary":" Hello! I've been sitting on this story for a while.

She rushed through the doors; Ben Jones was greeted with thensight of his bouncing sixteen-year-old daughter waiting for himnimpatiently by the front desk. He signed the necessary forms andnSophie pranced over to one of the computers. But before she sat down,nshe jogged back over to the man who had raised her alone for the lastneleven years, threw her arms around him, and asked him to wish hernluck. He obliged and watched a little worriedly as she plopped downnat a station. Forty five minutesnlater, Sophie Jones had her driver's license, much to the hiddenndismay of her father. Following another huge hug on the part ofnSophie, they strolled back to the car she had received for hernbirthday, a black '69 Charger, her baby. She and her father hadnspent the entire summer before the beginning of junior year restoringnand outfitting it with performance parts. What surprised Sophie thenmost, however, was that her father was so apprehensive about lettingnher drive it. Deciding to put it out of her mind, at least for now,nshe pulled out of the parking lot. Turning the radio onnfull blast, she shouted over the music. \"See Daddy, I told you I'dnpass!\" Her father merely shook his head and laughed a little. \"Yountotally had nothing to worry about.\" Distracted, she didn'tnnotice that she had run a red light, narrowly missing a collisionnwith a semi. \"Watch the road!\"nher father bellowed. \"Sorry,\" she saidnsheepishly.

She turned to the front in time to see a pick-up trucknbarreling toward them at ninety miles per hour.

She screamed. \"I love you Sophie!\"nher father shouted to her before the truck slammed into them. 124578 The lights flashednabove her. She was vaguely aware of a dull ache in her legs and back,nas well as her head. The lights kept moving by quickly. They were sonpretty; she smiled wanly. Then there were distant voices. They seemednto be telling her everything was going to be fine; she was going tonbe fine. With that knowledge in mind, she calmly floated off into thenblack void that was accompanied by the cool flow of air down her nosenand the slight pinch on the inside of her left elbow.[Chapter 2] CHAPTERnONE ONE MONTH LATER Sophie sighed as shenlooked out of the window, listening to the man next to her talk aboutnsomething or another. Since the...accident, her uncle Max Tarconi,nthe only remaining family she had, had come from France to take carenof her, at least until she turned eighteen and went back to thenStates for college. Strangely, she wasn't all that upset that henwas taking her back to France with him. She had always wanted to gonthere, and since she had gotten released from the hospital she hadn'tnhad much of a life anyway. She had locked herself into her room andnhad refused any human contact for almost two weeks, and cryingnherself to sleep every night. She hadn't started school withneverybody else either. Finally, after a particularly bad day on whichnshe had refused to get out of bed, the housekeeper had forciblynextracted Sophie from her haven and made her sit outside. Then, anweek later, she was informed she would be moving to France since hernuncle couldn't leave his job. And now she was on a plane headingnfor Marseilles, tuning out her uncle's stories about what anwonderful place it was. Some turbulence jolted her from her thoughts. \"…before you startnschool. Would you like that?\" She turned her head andnlooked at him. \"Sorry, what?\" He sighed. \"Would younlike to rest and get used to France for a month before you startnschool?\" \"Oh…yes, that wouldnbe wonderful.\" Tarconi leaned into thenplush backing of his seat and smiled, satisfied that his niece hadnsaid more than three words at once to him. They hadn't reallynconnected yet. \"I would like to stop somewhere before we head tonthe hotel.\" \"Where are we going?\"nSophie asked, now interested. \"I want to visit annold friend, actually. He is the son of my old partner.\" Sophie nodded andnresumed looking out of the oblong slab of glass until the planenlanded. After an hour ofnbaggage claims and airport security procedures, uncle and niecenemerged into the bright sunlight of southern France. Sophie took anmoment to breathe and look at her surroundings before sitting in thencar and driving with her uncle to the residence of his mysteriousnfriend. Forty-five minutesnlater, the old four-door pulled onto the gated the driveway of anSpanish-looking villa. She stepped out of the car and stretched hernlong legs, clad in dark jeans. Standing up, she caught her firstnglimpse of Frank Martin. He came walking out ofnthe door with his arms crossed and a friendly smirk on his handsomenface. He was wearing a rich-colored dress shirt and black slacks,nconfidence practically radiating off of him. What caught hernattention the most, however, were his eyes. They were the kind ofneyes that caught you off guard. Light blue, friendly, but at the samentime held a reserved self assurance. Next to those, she noticed hisnsculpted features. All in all, Frank Martin was the epitome of ruggednhandsomeness. \"Good to see younFrank,\" her uncle said. \"You too.\" Theyntalked quietly for a minute until Frank turned his attention tonTarconi's niece. \"Who's this?\" \"Ah, this would be mynniece Sophie. She will be living with me until college,\" Max said,nlooking at her with something resembling pride. \"Sophie, FranknMartin, Frank, Sophie Jones.\" They shook hands, Sophie's manynbracelets jingling, and she couldn't help but notice how strong hisnhand felt. \"Now, what do you have to eat?\" he asked, though notnaltogether jokingly. Frank laughed, a full,nrich sound. His visitors followed him into the kitchen. The three atenlunch in relative silence, only the occasional jumbled phrase comingnout of her uncle's full mouth. For a French man, he didn't have anlot of restraint when it came to cuisine. Finally, the food was gone,nand Frank and Max resumed talking after Frank had given Max andnhimself a glass of wine; Sophie got an Orangina, and somehow thatnirked her. Frank noticed her snatch up the can with somethingnresembling annoyance, and merely raised an eyebrow. Sophie almostnscowled. Didn't everyone , including kids, drink wine in thisncountry? After finishing thenwine, Frank and Max walked out into the garage. Sophie knew that thenexcuse they had given her, that they were going to discuss 'oldntimes' was a load of crap. Frank couldn't have been more thatntwenty, and a twenty year could not afford to live in such lavishnsurroundings unless they had inherited a family fortune or wereninvolved in some illegal activity, and since she knew that his fathernwas a police officer, the first option was ruled out. And so Sophie sat,nstaring at her drink, and contemplating why she felt so annoyed atnthe fact that she didn't have Frank Martin figured out, andnwondering what her life would be like from now on. Her thoughts lednher to memories of her previous life, and the person she was beforenthe accident. She was carefree and giggly, always around people andnthe center of attention. People were drawn to her not because shenpopular by being a bitch, but because she was truly and genuinelynnice. Being raised in privileged surrounding and without a mothernhadn't done anything to lessen her good attitude toward life or tonturn her into a selfish brat. But that was all gone now, and she knewnit was her fault; she was driving the car when the accident happenednso it was her fault her father was dead. Her way of dealing with itnwas locking herself in her room and doing something she had nevernthought she would do. A couple of days afternbeing released from the hospital, she had hobbled into her father'snroom in tears, overcome with emotions. She had plopped down onto thenhuge bed and stared around the room, remembering past times and such.nThen she spotted the bathroom door; it was open a crack. Shenremembered how she used to sneak into the oversize Jacuzzi when herndad was out of town and soak for hours. She had stumbled into thenbathroom and regarded the marble tub with cold eyes. Then she hadnturned on the water; when it was filled, she had climbed in andnsubmerged herself until she couldn't breathe. Unfortunately, thenhousekeeper had barged in before Sophie drowned. The portlynmiddle-aged woman had been livid. For the next week, she subjectednher charge to constant scrutiny. One night, Sophie walked to thenbathroom again and had stolen an unused razor. That night was thenfirst night she had cut herself; the pain had brought blessed reliefnfrom the constant guilt and grief. It felt as if from havingnsomething acute to concentrate on, she could dull the mental andnemotional pain. However, the next morning she had been terrified ofnwhat would happen if she was found out, so she started wearingnlong-sleeved shirts more and more often, along with as many braceletsnas could fit on her wrist. To make matters worse,nher friends would not give up trying to see her. Everyday they came;nbefore driving home from the up scale prep school that Sophie hadnattended in the expensive cars that had been given to them by theirnrich parents. But Sophie was adamant that she be kept alone, sonpretty soon, her former friends and classmates had stopped talking tonher altogether. And then there was the scar. It was huge and glaring,non her upper leg. It was a constant reminder of the accident, whichnhad been what caused it. Every time she changed, or limped instead ofnwalked, her mind replayed the horrible last moments of her father'sndeath. Sophie took the lastnsip of her drink and rested her head in her hand. Then it occurred tonher that she hadn't even bothered to look around the room. Shenthrew the can away and started walking around the living room andnturned in a full circle, taking in the sight of the room. Thenbookcase was what caught her eye, and she walked over to it. Readingnthe many titles, she came upon a very old leather-bound book. Takingnit off the shelf, she realized what the title was. The Once andnFuture King ; she grimaced. It had been her father's favoritenbook. Sighing deeply, Sophie made her way over to the couch and satndown, opening the aging book. After five minutes of reading, shenreturned the book to its rightful place. She was so immersed innbrowsing all of the titles that she didn't hear Frank approach. Frank took his time tonobserve the young girl in front of him. Despite being only sixteen,nshe was already mature enough to be considered a woman, and her bodynhelped that. She was medium height, slim but curvy, and endowed withnlong legs. Her skin was the tanned shade that most girls fromnCalifornia had, but it was now considerably paler since she had spentnthe last three weeks inside. Her eyes were a deep brown, and hernchestnut brown hair hung below her shoulder-blades. By the time he realizednhe was staring, she was reaching up to take another book. Amused withnthe fact that she was reading his father's most preciousnpossessions, he waited to see which one she would choose. She reachednup to retrieve a copy of Anna Karenina , making her braceletsnslide further up her arm, exposing her wrists. Frank's mouth openednslightly at the sight of several angry red welts on the delicate skinnof her wrists. He cleared his throat slightly and Sophie jumped, hernhand flying to her throat. Frank stared at her, hard. She stared back at himnsuspiciously. Then she realized that his eyes kept darting to hernbracelets. Suddenly her hands felt clammy; he must have seen the cutsnwhen she was getting the book. But that meant that he had beennstanding there for quite a while, and that made Sophie none toonthrilled. She was even less thrilled at the prospect of Uncle Maxnfinding out what she had been doing when she was locked up in hernroom. \"What?\" she finallynsnapped, crossing her arms. Frank looked at hernsharply. He had just seen something that had completely surprisednhim, something that no one should have been doing, and she wasnyelling at him? He usually didn't hold any stock in the popularnbelief that Americans were forward, but this girl was proving to benjust that. \"Why the bracelets?\"nhe asked. Sophie narrowed herneyes; he knew perfectly well why she wore her bracelets. Deciding notnto dignify the query with a response, she brushed past him, but hengrabbed her arm. She ripped it from him, but this time he took hernright wrist in both of his hands and pushed the bracelets back. Therenwere countless red marks there. Seeing him staring atnher skin like that, with pity and something resembling outrage, shenbegan to get scared. \"Why?\" he muttered. Jerking her hand away,nshe practically ran from the room and out to Max Tarconi's car. Frank didn't go afternher, sensing that she needed some alone time. But he was worried.nWhat had driven her to such an extreme? And he was at a loss. If hentold Max what was going on, he would have to no doubt deal with thenbrunt of a teenaged girl's anger. If he kept it a secret, he wouldnhave to live with the knowledge that he had known that a girl wasnhurting herself and that he hadn't done anything about it. In thenend, he decided that it wasn't his business, and that what wouldnhappen would also remain none of his business. Still, he felt a sensenof dread for the American girl that he had just met. 08080 Max Tarconi walked outnto his car. He saw Sophie huddled in the front seat with her armsnaround her and tears streaming down her cheeks. He had told Frank anhasty good-bye before running out to comfort his bereaved niece.nClimbing into the car, he didn't know how to act. He had never donenwell with crying females, especially young ones. Still, he wrappednhis arms around Sophie and to his relief she didn't pull away. Sobbing onto thenshoulder of the only family she had left, Sophie knew that shencouldn't face people yet. She just wasn't ready to meet newnpeople and start a new life when she was still not over the tragedynof the one she had lost. \"Don't make me gonto school,\" she sobbed, her body shaking. \"Please don't make mengo to school.\" \"Sshhh,\" her unclensoothed. \"You don't have to go anywhere if you don't want to.\" Sophie stopped cryingnjust as they reached Max's house.[Chapter 3] CHAPTERnTWO Two YearsnLater Sophie sat at the desknin her uncle's office and stared out the window. The feelings shenwas experiencing assaulted her like an ambush, and it was all shencould do to keep from crying. Tomorrow would change her life.nTomorrow would bring havoc, confusion, and irritation. Tomorrow,nSophie Jones left for college in the States. Unlike most othernpeople her age, she was not as excited as she should have been. Shenshould have been prancing with joy at the thought of 'escaping'nstrict guardianship; at the thought of freedom and lessnresponsibility. And yet she knew that was not the way it was going tonbe: moving out created even more responsibility and problems.nShe shuddered just thinking about it. Sophie had grown tonlove her uncle with the two years she had lived with him. France hadnproved to be a good remedy, but it was not enough. At the prospect ofnschool, she had fallen into depression, and had nearly cut off allnhuman contact; it hadn't been especially hard, considering the onlynperson she knew in the country had been her uncle, and he workednirregular hours. Finally he had noticed, and had promised her thatnshe could complete high school through a gifted program at Princetonnon the internet. And so she had, with honors too. It didn't overlynexcite her. She swiveled around innthe chair, trying to entertain herself, her eyes repeatedly scanningnthe picture of Max Tarconi and his former partner Albert Martin. Shenremembered all of the times that Max had gone to visit Frank, and allnof the times she had refused, if subtly, to accompany him. She wasnnervous about Frank, and she didn't know why. If he hadn't toldnabout her 'hobby' yet, then he most likely wouldn't tell now.nAt the moment, she was pretty sure that her uncle knew she didn'tnreally have headaches every time he went to Marseilles. Besides, Sophie hadnmoved on. Her first year in France had been a very troubled one.nThere was an apartment a few doors down occupied by four Universitynroommates. They weren't the most pristine citizens. She had firstnstumbled upon them climbing up the stairs, returning from a habitualnwalk; they had been smoking, and not cigarettes either. She hadnstruck up a friendship. The next thing she knew, she was smoking andndrinking every night. Then it had led to serious drugs; she hadnoverdosed and had to be rushed to the hospital. Her uncle had beennhighly disappointed, and that had led to her stopping. However, shenhad picked up somewhat of a flippant attitude when she was amongnpeople. It had become a habit to act as though she didn't care innfront of others. At home, she was the same quiet and withdrawn Sophienshe had been when she had moved in with her uncle. And sadly, he had foundnout about her cutting. He had not beennunderstanding at first, but who would be when a sixteen-year-old inntheir guardianship was hurting herself? When they had told him at thenhospital, Max had been silent; he was at a complete loss of what tondo. He had never been married, had never had any kids, he had neverneven had to take care of a plant in his life. But he had pullednhimself together, for Sophie's sake, and for the sake of his ownnsanity. Now he understood more clearly the effects the death of hernfather were having on her. From then on, he became much more involvednin her life. And now she was leavingnhim. She felt as though she was betraying herself, as well as hernuncle. It wasn't as if she would never come back; no, it was thenfact that she got the feeling she forced people away from her. Hernfather's death and disappearance from her life were always on hernmind—she thought it was her doing. Her uncle wouldn't be aroundnher nearly as much now either. She slowly left thenchair and walked to the kitchen, wondering how she was going to feednherself when she was independent. She barely ate anyways; without hernuncle and his constant attention, she would have given up onneverything altogether, but her desire to make him proud drove her.nAnd everyone needed something to drive them. Sighing, Sophie restednher chin on her hand as she munched on an apple, contemplating hernlife and all of its possible courses. She was so preoccupied that shendidn't notice Max arrive, bearing a large white box. It turned out to be anlaptop—a very expensive and high-tech laptop. Her uncle said it wasnfor college, and a way to keep in touch with him. She smiled andnhugged him. Two hours later, shenwas on a plane once again.[Chapter 4] CHAPTERnTHREE Sophie stared out atnthe country of France, getting a strange feeling of déjànvu. Well, at least it wasngood déjà vu. During her time back innthe States, Sophie had matured. Physically, she could rival MonicanBelluci. Mentally, her state of being had improved immensely. Shendidn't dwell on the bad as much as she used to. Of course, therenwas the occasional bad day, but the good days outweighed the bad. She had obtained anBachelor's in Journalism, and minored in French. Going to school innher first natural environment had done her a world of good. Sophienhad even had several boyfriends, though none of her relationships hadnlasted more than a few months. Pushing back flashbacksnof her last rather messy breakup, she concentrated on the now. Shenwas looking forward to seeing her uncle again more than she had evernlooked forward to anything. They had talked once or twice a week,nevery week, and she had gone back to Marseilles almost everynChristmas, but it was not nearly like the bond they had formed afternher stay at the hospital. Max had almost filled up the void the lossnof her father had left, but he never tried to replace him, for whichnshe was grateful. LATER Following an almostntearful greeting by Max and a delicious multiple course lunch, Sophienwas on her way to see Frank Martin for the first time in roughly halfna decade. Max Tarconi told his niece that he had an especiallynimportant appointment in that area, so it was a good idea that theyndrop by Frank's. Sophie had not had the heart to refuse. She didn'tnwant he uncle to worry about her disliking the only son of his veryngood and departed friend. She wondered how he hadnchanged, or even if he had changed. Frank struck her as the kind ofnperson that didn't alter themselves much because of extremenself-assurance. Her mind was also filled with a strange need to findnout if he had thought about her at all. It was unexplainable, thisnneed. The sensation somewhat resembled thirst. Her thoughts left thatntopic, however, when they pulled up to the villa once again. Shentired to shove away the butterflies in her stomach and thenirritatingly girlish feelings that accompanied them. She was nervousnthough, she had to admit. XXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxOOOOOOoooooooXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxOOOOOOoooooooo Frank was diggingnaround in the hood of his car when he heard another car pulling intonhis driveway. Suddenly he remembered that Max was dropping by today. Putting away all of hisntools and wiping his hands free of grease, he walked out of thengarage and towards the front of his home, only to stop short when henspotted exactly who had accompanied Max. A stunning brunettenclimbed out of the dingy old four-door, sliding a pair of designernsunglasses onto the top of her head. Clad in a pale pink tank top, anjean skirt, and slightly high-heeled sandals, she turned her headnjust in time to see him start walking towards her. It took Frank a goodnminute to recognize just who this beauty was. He couldn't believenthat the angry little teenager had transformed so much. Then again,ntime changed people. By the time he reachednthe car, he realized that she was smiling at him shyly. He gave her ansmirk, causing a certain fire to begin within her eyes. Her smilendropped a little in intensity. \"So, Frank, how isnlife?\" Max interrupted the silent interlude. \"Life is good. Hownabout yourself?\" The last part was directed more to Sophie; shenmerely looked at him. Max used this opportunity to brag. \"Sophie justngraduated college,\" he stated, somewhat unsure as to why Frank andnhis niece were regarding each other with such intensity. \"Oh,\" Franknreplied. \"What kind of degree?\" \"Journalism,\"nSophie jumped in before Max could say anything. Frank only nodded,nraising his eyebrows for a fraction of a second. Suddenly he turnednaround and led his visitors into the house. Sophie noted with somensatisfaction that his shoulders were visibly tense. XXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxOOOOOOOOOooooooooXXXXXXxxxxxxOOOooo The tri spent a totalnof an hour over food and drinks engaged in discussion, in whichnSophie was not very actively involved. She was secretly happy thatnshe had been allowed wine this time, although the thought made hernwant to snort. By six in the evening,nthe only thing left to talk about was Sophie's life in the States,nand she was beginning to feel the effects of the wine. Frank noticednthis. \"I hope you didn'tndrink this much in college,\" he stated when Max left for thenbathroom. Sophie attempted answeet smile, but it came out more of a grimace. \"Actually, I wasnconcentrating too much on getting my thesis written and working atnthe same time to have time left over for partying.\" Frank only nodded, notnlooking quiet convinced. In her slightly fuzzy mind, she took it asnan indication that he thought she was lying. That was when Sophie gotna little angry. Out of pure spite, the question that had been on hernmind since she first glimpsed his car slipped out of her mouth. \"I've alwaysnwondered, Frank, how you made your living.\" He took a moment tonlook at her. \"I'm a driver.\" \"Hm. That is veryninteresting. I haven't heard of many drivers that can afford homesnon the coast of the Mediterranean and luxury cars.\" \"What was your thesisnabout?\" He asked through a slightly tight jaw. \"The transportationnof goods illegally. You know, at first I didn't think I could makenit as a journalist. But then I really started researching. And guessnwhat happened? A year before I graduated I was offered an internshipnat the Times. I even helped uncover a drug ring on campus.\" Shenwaited to see his reaction. His jaw was clenchedntightly; tighter than it was a minute ago. Her uncle chose thatnmoment to make his appearance again. He was shocked at the tension innthe room. \"Sophie, I have tonget going. I'm sorry for bringing this up so suddenly, but couldnSophie possibly spend the night Frank?\" Both members of hisnaudience stared at him, stunned. \"I don't know how long thisnthing will take.\" When he got no further reaction, he told hisnniece he would pick her up in the morning, thanked Frank, and walkednout the door. Sophie and Franknsilently regarded each other, until she grabbed the bottle of winenand her glass and stalked towards the couch. Frank sighed. 012345 Thanks so much for thenreviews! They are greatly appreciated! Keep them coming, while I'mnstill inspired. Or at least until the holidays are over, becausenschool resumes people![Chapter 5] CHAPTERnFOUR Sophie plopped downnonto the couch and promptly began filling her glass with wine. Shencould hear Frank rise and began cleaning up the kitchen. After hernsecond glass of wine, he joined her. \"Mind if I join you?\"nhe asked, attempting to me civil. Sophie snorted. \"It'snnot like I have much of a choice.\" Frank frowned. If she noticednit, no indication was given. And so they commenced,neach downing at least three more glasses of vintage wine. It wasn'tnquite enough for Frank to become drunk, but Sophie was completelyninebriated. By her fourth glass, she was chattering animatedly atnFrank, who merely regarded his charge for the night with a slightnsmirk. \"And so we'rensitting there, and in walks this little old lady with a dog, one ofnthose miniature poodles, the kind that never stop barking, you know.nSo I say to him, 'Maybe we should get out of here,' but he justnlooks at the poodle and starts making these ridiculous noises,nand I tell you, it was the funniest thing I've ever seen. Angrown man making fart noises at a blue dog! I started laughing, and Inhonestly couldn't stop. The little lady didn't find the situationnso funny though.\" Here her story paused, and Sophie frownednfaintly. \"In fact, she started went after him with her purse…didnyou know that rich old ladies carry bags that weigh as much as a bagnof bricks? He got up and ran out of the restaurant.\" Sophie begannlaughing. \"He ran out of the place like a ghost was chasing him!\" Frank watched almostncalmly as Sophie toppled off the couch in a fit of near hystericalnlaughter before leaning back and letting his own laughter loose. Thenpair had been snickering for almost a full minute when Frank glancedndown at the brunette on the floor and noticed that her skirt hadnrisen during her fall, exposing her right upper thigh. What this affordednFrank was a more than ample view of the angry white lines that ragednon an expanse of smooth skin. It occurred to him that this wasnanother result of the accident in which Sophie's father had lostnhis life. Meanwhile, Sophienbecame aware of the absence of Frank's rumbling laugh, and noticednthat he was gazing at her leg so attentively that it scared her. Shenlooked down and saw her exposed thigh. The sight sobered herninstantly. Quickly rising, shentugged her skirt down, planted her hands on her hips and glared atnFrank more or less accusingly. She didn't quite know why she feltnso betrayed. She did know that she felt angry, and it wasn't whollynat Frank. It was her own fault for letting herself get drunk enoughnto make jokes with a man she considered more or less her enemy. Somewhere in the backnof her fuzzy mind Sophie wondered when exactly she had begun to viewnFrank as an enemy. Frank, however, wasnalmost riveted by the sight of her standing in front of him, angernand frustration pouring out of rich brown eyes. At the moment, thoseneyes were anything but friendly, and Frank wasn't going to let themnstay directed at him. He reached out andnpulled on Sophie's arm, effectively seating her back on the couch.nHe was just about to put an arm around her when she nearly flew fromnthe couch and stood, staring at him again. \"Sophie,\" he began,nnot used to comforting, \"I know that this is hard to get over—\" \"Oh, how do younknow!\" She screamed at him. \"How do you know what it's like tongo through life knowing that it's your fault the person you lovednthe most in the entire world is dead!\" She glanced at thenbookshelves, becoming immersed in the reflection of the gold titlesnon leather binding. \"How could you possibly know the kind of quiltnthat brings every Goddamn day!\" She yelled in his generalndirection. Frank was gettingnangrier by the second. How dare she come into this house, drink hisnwine, and then start shouting at him, when she didn't know anythingnabout his past? He stood up and stalked over to her, grabbing an armnand yanking her around. This seemed to make her even angrier, if thatnwere at all possible. \"You don't knownanything at all about me, you ungrateful little brat,\" he statedncalmly to her face. \"You don't know what kind of ordeals I'venbeen through. I bet Max never told you that I am responsible for mynparents' death, did he? No, of course he didn't. So before younstart accusing me of being insensitive, think about the person you'renscreeching at and what they could have possibly been through.\" To his immensensurprise, Sophie didn't scream again, didn't hit him, and didn'tnhurl profanities. Instead, she seemed to collapse as tears poured outnof those deep eyes and onto flushed cheeks. Frank caught her, huggingnher around the waist and brining her head to his shoulder. Sophie hadn't criednthis much since her first meeting with Frank Martin. In fact, she hadnnever cried this hard in her entire life. What was it with this mannand his ability to bring her emotional stability to its knees? It was then that itndawned on her that she was crying in the arms of the man in front ofnwhom she wanted to be the most strong. It also registered to her thatnhis arms felt extremely nice around her middle. That thought broughtnher to her senses. Frank felt Sophienstiffen in his arms, then pause. She disentangled herself from hisnsupport and pulled away. \"I think I'm goingnto bed now,\" she stated icily. Frank watched as she turned andnstalked up the stairs. He shook his headnbefore putting it in his hands. 012345 Voila. Forgive the longnupdate.[Chapter 6] CHAPTERnFIVE Sophie sighed tiredlynas she glanced at the clock on the dashboard of her Altima, parkednconveniently in an alley across from a sagging old warehouse. Exactlynone minute had passed since the last time she had checked. Restingnher head in her hand, she continued to gaze at the darkened buildingnahead of her, wondering why it was exactly that drug lords couldn'tnjust appear when they were wanted to. It was her first bignassignment for the Times, and she was more than just a littlennervous. It wasn't that she doubted her ability to defend herself,nit was the fact that her surveillance was already at the length ofntwo hours and no sign of life had as of yet come from the dilapidatednwarehouse she was watching. However, she was proudnof herself; after only four and a half months of working for one ofnthe most prestigious newspapers in the nation, her boss had informednher that she was to cover the story of one of Manhattan's mostnnotorious drug dealers. Not only was Alex Nomikov sitting pretty innthe center of New York's drug network (with a Hispanic mother and anRussian father) the man was positively ruthless. After digging aroundnand following Nomikov for nearly a month, Sophie had discovered thatnthe list of his rather grisly 'accomplishments' wasnextraordinary: at twenty, he had 'convinced' his father to handnover the reigns of the family business; three years later, seven ofnAlex's most worthy opponents were found brutally shot to death in angruesome tribute to Al Capone and his masterful orchestration of thenSt. Valentine's Day Massacre; and now, at twenty eight, Nomikovnwholly controlled the New York underground. Sophie was thrilled. Just when she thoughtnthat no one was in the building anymore, she saw a light switch on.nIt was followed by a silenced gun shot and a sickening splat.nShivering with excitement, Sophie grabbed her purse and slipped outnof the dark blue car, and shutting the door as quietly as possible,nbegan the trek across the street. The next gunshot gavenher pause, but however strong her misgivings about her upcomingncircumstances were, she continued around the side of the building andnslipped in through a slightly ajar exit door. Not five seconds afternentering the warehouse, she heard another shot, and following thensound, stumbled upon the hallway adjacent to the room in which AlexnNomikov and his less that upstanding colleagues were more than likelyntorturing the man's latest enemy. It was all she could do to keepnfrom snorting at his predictable psychopathic means of entertainment. Quickly opening hernpurse, Sophie pulled out her recorder and silently made her way overnto the only source of light in the darkened building. The first sound thatnmet her ears was a man's painful pants, followed by a chillinglyncontrolled voice with a slight Russian accent. \"Tell me, did younhonestly think you stood even a tiny chance of playing both sides?\"nNomikov asked, his anger evident. \"It is nearly impossible. Wouldnyou like me to tell you why?\" He paused; the sound ofna gun being cocked could be heard. \"It is impossiblenbecause you are leading a double life. It is not healthy for thenpsyche. In fact, your recent sniveling activities can almost bencompared to a rather unfortunate psychological disorder. Multiplenpersonality disorder, perhaps you've heard of it?\" There was a shotnfollowed by a man's stifled scream. \"Of course you have.\"nHis sneer could be heard through his voice. \"In fact, you yourselfncould be considered a defect. Do you know what they used to do tonpeople like you?\" The gun cocked again.nThe victim's desperate smothered pleas rose in intensity. \"They used to killnthem.\" The man's gaggedncries stopped. Sophie had to cover hernmouth to keep from vomiting. The criminal was even more heartlessnthan she had originally thought. That thought, however,nwas dispelled when the sound of a body landing on the floor wasnheard. Dropping the recorder back into her purse, Sophie turnednaround and began walking as fast and quietly as she could towards thendoor that she had used to gain entrance to the building, and uponnreaching it, discovered one very unusual thing. It was locked. Pushing down the panic,nSophie slowly glanced around the dank hallway, looking for any othernmeans of escape. Noting that there were no windows anywhere in sight,nthe panic swung in full force. Breathing deeply andntrying to get her pulse rate back to normal, Sophie set off down thenhallway to her right, hoping to God that there was a door or and opennwindow that she could climb out of. She had walked for about tennseconds when she heard footsteps behind her. Despite all of hernpreviously learned techniques of calm, every single piece of advicenand training she had been given to survive in situations like thesendeserted her, and so, she ran. She ran so fast and sonheedlessly, in fact, that she didn't even know where she wasnheaded; she ran so far and so blindly that she only stopped at a deadnend, with the footsteps following her all the way. Sophie was aboutnto turn and attempt to find her bearings when a bullet ricoched offnthe wall not three inches from her head. \"Turn around,\" ansoft voice commanded from behind her. She silently obeyed, only to benmet with the barrel of a gun pointed directly between her eyes.n\"Follow me,\" was murmured before the metal was retracted from hernforehead. The man stepped awaynfrom Sophie, gesturing with his handgun in the direction that she hadncome from. Gulping, Sophie slowly stepped forward, and was not allnthat surprised when the man grabbed her arm roughly and began fairlyndragging her to what she presumed to be the room that Nomikov wasnoccupying. \"He'll like you,\"nthe thug stated; Sophie began trembling. Although Sophie hadnseen Alex Nomikov on film, she was not prepared for his presence.nPsychotic control freak or not, Nomikov still possessed a handsomenface, dark hair, and broad shoulders. If she had been in any othernsituation, Sophie would have thought him exactly her type, had it notnbeen for the utter iciness and condescension shining through his paleneyes. Nevertheless, this wasnnot that situation, and the only thoughts swirling around Sophie'snanxiety ridden mind were of the numerous slow and horrible deathsnthis man could inflict on her, none of which were a welcomenpossibility. Alex Nomikov, on thenother hand, was entirely composed. He stood leaning against one wall,nsilently observing Sophie, taking in the black slacks, light purplenblouse, and heeled sling-backs, as well as her disheveled hair andnflushed face. Smiling coldly, henpushed off the blood splattered wall and slowly walked towardsnshaking brunette, rubbing a hand over his chin slowly. Sophie didn't likenthe purely predatory look on his slightly smiling face…not one bit. He stopped about sixninches away and stood, contemplating her face. This was when Sophiendecided it would do her good to have an alibi. Maybe she could saynthat she was simply driving by and heard noise? Maybe she could say— \"So you're thenlittle reporter that's been following, aren't you?\" Sophie froze, her mouthndropping open slightly. \"How—\" \"Oh come now, did younexpect me not to know about all the people I have spying on me? Whatnwith all of your research I thought you would know that I havenfriends in high places.\" The absolute calm of his voice was enoughnto unravel Sophie further. \"You should also know that people do notnappreciate having their dealings be watched constantly and thennreported, only to be published for the entire population of thengreater New York area to read and discuss. See this man?\" He turnednaround and lightly pushed the dead body on the floor with his foot,nlooking at the corpse disdainfully. \"This was the last person thatnattempted to interrupt my operations.\" Nomikov sighed almostnregretfully. \"Some people just don't know when to mind their ownnbusiness. Like you.\" He walked back tonSophie, this time stopping a mere couple of inches from her face.n\"What will I do with you? I suppose you've gotten a good deal ofninformation tonight haven't you?\" Nomikov tilted his head to thenside. \"Yes, I have no doubt that you have.\" Sophie resumednbreathing as he grabbed her purse and dumped its contents onto thenred concrete floor. Picking up the recorder, he rewound the tape andnplayed it back. Glancing at the woman in front of him, he raised hisneyebrows as if in appreciation. \"Well,\" he began,n\"what to do. I assume that you are capable of forgetting theninformation you so carefully collected tonight, aren't you?\"nSophie felt a ray of hope. \"But the thing is, I don't know if Incan trust you.\" The ray of hope vanished as Alex stalked towardsnher again. She felt tears prickle the back of her eyelids as hengrabbed her around the waist and brought her closer to him; bilenbegan to rise in her throat at the close contact. Nomikov pullednsomething out of his back pocket, all the while regarding the shakingnSophie. Oh God, this it…I'mngoing to die, I'm going to die! Expecting to feel anbullet impact her temple, Sophie squeezed her eyes shut. Therefore,nshe was immensely surprised when instead of a bullet, she felt coolncotton against her face. Breathing a sigh of relief, she breathed innbefore remembering that chloroform was a very popular substance usednby those involved in not-so-legal activities. The last thought thatnfloated through her mind before Sophie's world went black was whynit was that she forgot everything important at the most crucialnmoments, and a curse at herself, Nomikov, and every other Goddamnnthing under the sun. Author's Note: Well there you go. I've got a question for my readers: what didnyou think of my villain? Should I make him funny, perverted? Do tell,nsuggestions are always welcome. Oh, and thanks for reviewing! D[Chapter 7] CHAPTER SIX Frank Martin was notnhaving a good day. Scratch that, he wasn't having a good year. First the ordeal with Lai and her psychotic freak of a father,nand then the run-in with Gianni, finding Jack and returning him safenand sound to Audrey…who had seemed not in the least bit reluctantnto let go of whatever might have been and go back to her husband. Henhad even thrown his rules out the proverbial window; they had alwaysnended up being broken anyway. The lack of at least that stability wasnenough to make him a bit antsy. No…it most definitelynwas not a good year. Which was why he nownfound himself stuck in heavy Manhattan traffic. New York was almost anculture shock compared to California; the people were different, thensights were different, hell, even the air seemed different somehow.nMaybe that was due to the almost constant fumes of odor waftingnaround or the congesting quality of the public's shouts, but henwasn't complaining. Drowned most of the thoughts from his head…annalmost pleasant distraction. At least it was untilnthe entirety of the population of New York City appeared to have gonenhorn-happy. What was with these people? Sighing curtly innfrustration, Frank began maneuvering his brand-spanking new black 720ntowards his exit, edging past a middle-aged woman in a mini-van,ncasting a small smile in her direction. The snarl she sent him andnthe near collision her anger caused struck him as almost certainnknowledge that he would soon seriously doubt his decision to move tonNew York. \"Wench,\" henmuttered, speeding off the freeway and onto country roads on the waynto meet his newest client, an Alex Nomikov, who was apparently thennew ring-leader of the Russian thugs that permeated New York. Franknsighed. Another idiot with delusions of grandeur. The only bit ofnknowledge worth anything procured by Frank's research was that Mr.nNomikov was exceptionally sadistic. The pictures taken of what wasnbelieved to be his latest victim were gruesome, to put it lightly.nWho knew the Russian underground could procure weapons capable ofnsuch precise torture? And on the deceased, no less. No respect atnall. Frank resisted the urgento roll his eyes as he pulled up to the Victorian home specified innduring his brief conversation with Nomikov's second-in-command.nSergei had said a mile from the edge of the city, the tan three-storynhouse, which turned out to be the most frightening shade of vanillan(strangely resembling melted ice cream left out too long) Frank hadnever had the misfortune of witnessing. One would think a steadilynrising criminal would consider maintaining at least a semblance ofnanonymity; the line of two Beamers, three Mercedes, and a Hummer,ncompounded with the pulsing base of techno emerging from thenhorrendous mansion, served to prove otherwise. It was safe to say thatnas Alex sauntered out of the house clad in a wind breaker andnmatching pants, Frank didn't know what to expect. The man probablynonly wanted him to deliver coke or some such thing. So the sight of anstocky fellow walked out behind Nomikov toting a yellow oversized duffle bag made Frank understandably apprehensive. Thenhefting of the stuffed, still bag into his trunk and the slamming ofnsaid trunk, along with Nomikov's subsequent tossing of the agreednsum into Frank's lap added to the irritation that had been buildingnall day. So much so, in fact, that Frank considered ending the dealnthen and there. Five years in the AirnForce, another seven spent establishing his credentials, and fornwhat? To become a peddler for an idiot with ridiculously gelled hair? \"Dispose of it,\"nAlex broke his thoughts before turning away and going back into thenhouse. Ah. A garbage mannthen. Nope. No respect atnall. XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxOOOOOOOOOOOOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxX Sophie groggily came tonas her forehead softly made contact with something hard.

(Grand Bluffs, Oklahoma 2018) It is not easy being a poor farm boy with big dreams and determination. I have longed to go on an incredible adventure that would become one for me to remember a long time. It started with a tale my Great Great Granddad once told me that was back in 1914. This story is long, but quite amazing, even though it would be my dad who told me that story as my Great Great Grandpa passed away before I was born. He was born on June 10, 1889 and died in 1989, eleven years before I was born. From what I was told, he and some fellow explorers went on a perilous journey to find the missing continent of Atlantis. Little did I know, I would soon be going on that same big adventure like my Grandpa did a hundred and four years ago. Where are my manners? I am super sorry for not introducing myself. My name is Holland McCullough, but ya'll can call me, \"Howlin' Mad\", as I am ruthless in sports and shout a lot. My Great Great Grandpa is the late Camdyn Bradley, Petty Officer First Class, United States Navy. He was apart of the Thatch expedition that was organized to search for Atlantis back in 1914. He was serving in the U.S. Navy on board the U.S.S. Texas for 15 days before being asked to take part in the Atlantis Exploration by Mr. Whitmore. He came back five months later and by that time, the world was at war. He found out that his brother had been killed at the Battle of Mulhouse after volunteering to fight for the French Army at the beginning of the war. He would stay in the Navy and leave the battleship Texas to join the crew of the newly commissioned U.S.S. Oklahoma. My Grandpa told me the story his grandpa told him about Officer Bradley. My granddad told me about it. \"Your great granddad told me about this here trip to Atlantis. He told me that they started the journey on board a massive submarine with hundreds of men and women. He was on the bridge with Commander Lyle Rourke, when….'BANG!'... they were then attacked by a creature that guards the entrance to Atlantis called the \"Leviathan.\" Milo Thatch said that this is a machine and had destroyed ships from all eras. It destroyed the submarine, but the remaining survivors managed to escape to the pocket Thatch had described in a journal he found. They managed to find the pocket and continue the journey with what equipment they have left. They traveled for a long time, braving many perils and obstacles from scary monsters to deep drops. They then set camp by the bridge that would lead them to further. Until, they were attacked by these fireflies that set clothe on fire. They tried to cross the bridge but the weight of the equipment forced the bridge to collapse. Luckily, not a lot of people were hurt. However, the expert of their excavation group, Gaetan \"Mole\" Moliére, soon told them that they were on the bottom of an active volcano. Your Grandpa Camdyn had injured his leg in the fall and had to be carried by Joshua Sweet, the Chief Medical Officer of the team. Milo was wounded on his shoulder but was saved by these creatures who wear these special crystals around their necks. We followed them to a cliff where we were then surrounded by the same people that healed Milo. The leader of them started speaking and Milo did his best to speak back in their language, Atlantean.\" I soon asked, \"Do they know any other languages?\" \"Why yes kiddo! They sure do. As Old Man Camdyn said, 'there language is the root dialect of all modern day languages, meaning that they know English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Russian, Greek, Turkish, Arabian, Mayan, and so on as their dialect is the root of all our languages. They welcome us to the Island of Atlantis. He described as one of the most beautiful and advanced places he had ever been to. Unfortunately, the king did not take too kindly about us being here, but Grandpa Camdyn said that he made many friends while there. Unfortunately, Rourke decided to turn against the group and Mr. Thatch, just to get the Heart of Atlantis, a special crystal that is what keeps the people of Atlantis and their culture alive. They also tried to steal the king's daughter, Princess Kidagakash Nedakh whom everyone referred to as \"Kida.\" Luckily, the group was able to defeat and kill Rourke and return the heart just in time as that volcano started to erupt. It then forced a force shield and saved the city. Sadly, Milo stayed behind to help the Atlantean's repair their society and way of life. The rest made it back as did Grandpa Bradley. Sadly, they all agreed to try and keep it a secret to keep people from coming and trying to steal the heart again.\" When I heard that story, I was shocked and a spark appeared in my eye. I was determined to find Atlantis myself, even if it costs me my life. However, I didn't have a lead or anyway of proving where this entrance was. I did, however, have a lead. I started by inviting a few school friends over, there names are Glenn Blackburn, Reginald Stanley, and Andrea Copeland. We were sitting at the table talking and then an idea flew into my head. I asked my friends \"Hey guys.\" they all looked at me. \"What is it Hollis?\" Reginald beckoned. \"I am gonna head over to our old house where we keep some old records and try to find some about my Great Great Granddad. Ya'll wanna come along?\" \"Why not?\" Andrea asked. We all then rode our bikes to the old house where we keep old furniture, clothes, belongings, and other assorted junk. I opened the door and we all walked in. We all started looking through boxes, but making sure to put stuff back after we got it out. We were looking until we noticed a rather strange letter in with the old letters and notes left from Grandpa Camdyn. However, this looked strange as it was not even opened. I opened it to see that it dates back to 1918, it is from Mr. Whitmore. \"Hey guys! Look what I found!\" soon, the three other kids gathered around. \"What is it?\" \"It is a letter from Mr. Whitmore, the man who funded the Atlantis Exploration and the discovery of the Shepard's Journal. It says here, and I quote, 'For you bravery and honor, I have given you some of my wealth and the Shepard's Journal for you. You are welcome to do whatever you like with this money and the journal itself.' It looks like this meant that he was given the journal.\" \"What exactly is so special about this journal?\" Glenn asked. \"Well...from what my grandpa told me, this journal is the key to finding Atlantis.\" \"But where is this Journal at?\" Andrea asked. \"I'm afraid I have no clue. The journal was said to have disappeared after Mr. Whitmore died. If anything I think the book might still be at his mansion. Either that, or it is elsewhere.\" \"Lets head back to your house Hollis. I think we might be able to find more clues there.\" \"All the same, I am still gonna take this letter and examine it.\" We all headed back to the house and we all grabbed ourselves Dr. Peppers. We turned on the TV and then it turned to a new exhibit that was opening at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. \"As the owner of the Smithsonian Institute, I hereby declare the Atlantis exhibit, Open!\" I looked at the TV and then I saw it, the Shepard's Journal. \"Guys! Look!\" I shouted as Glenn, Reginald, and Andrea looked at the TV and saw the journal as well. \"What is that journal you are trying to point out to us?\" Glenn asked me. \"That Glenn, is the Shepard's Journal. That journal is the key to finding the lost continent of Atlantis. We have got to get that book.\" \"How?\" Andrea asked. \"It is not like we can just walk up to the front door and try to steal that book.\" Just then, we heard the owner of the Smithsonian speak, \"Unfortunately, the journal will have to be moved to the Library of Congress due to the importance of the book.\" I then spoke, \"I think this might be our only chance to get that book.\" \"But how are we gonna get that book?\" \"I guess we have no choice, but to show that letter to them and get that book.\" \"What if they say no?\" Reginald asked. \"We Reggie; I guess we will have no choice, but to steal that book. I hate to do this, but I guess we have no choice but to.\" \"Well how are we gonna steal this book?\" Andrea asked me. \"Well Andy...I am gonna call in some help.\" So I went over to the phone and dialed in the number for the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad. \"Yes Hello?\" the operator said. \"Hello. Will you please get Mr. Morris McCullough.\" \"Sure thing. Please hold.\" I had to wait a few minutes before I heard his voice. \"Hello? Who is this?\" \"It is Howlin' Mad.\" \"Hey bro! How may I help you?\" \"Well Morry...\" I started. \"I need your help in trying to get to D.C. Will you be able to meet up with me and my friends at Cherokee Yard in Tulsa? We are about to go on a big adventure.\" \"Sure Howlin', but how exactly are you gonna get to Cherokee when Grand Bluffs is in Western Oklahoma?\" \"We will try to catch a train in Enid if we can get there in time and ride the rails to Tulsa.\" \"Good luck brother. I will meet you there in an old diesel at Cherokee Yard in four days. Don't be late.\" \"Right Brother! Goodbye now.\" I said as I hung up the phone. I looked at my friends and smiled. \"Pack your things. We are going on an adventure.\" my three friends looked at each other and smiled. \"I'm in!\" Reginald said. \"Oh what the heck! I might as well.\" Glenn replied. \"I'm looking for a chance to get out of this place.\" So we all packed our things. I packed some clothes, my laptop as I will have to look up important information, some food and cooking equipment, rope for tying things, passport I owned after my mom and dad died, I packed a tent and sleeping bag, and also took with me a lot of money. I met my friends by the now closed Nerton Westwend yard that was used by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe before merged with the Burlington Northern. We were standing by the tracks when we noticed something, an old General Motors GP7 diesel. We ran over to the old locomotive and loaded our stuff. I knew how to start this thing as I watched my brother many times start something as old as this. I started her up and checked to see how much fuel we have and saw that we have only barely half a tank. So, I had to make sure we didn't go too fast, otherwise we would run out of fuel quickly. We loaded all our bags and equipment on board and we started heading towards Enid. We waved at many kids who stood by the tracks and then we finally reached Enid and made it to the big freight yard in Enid. Sadly, our GP7 had broken down after not being moved for a long time and now we are stuck. I looked around the place until I saw a young man approach us as we pulled into an unused siding. I got out to speak to the man. \"Hello there young man. What are you doing? This track must be cleared for a Westbound Union Pacific freight train.\" \"I do apologize sir. We were trying to get this old diesel up to Cherokee Yard in Tulsa and we have broken down. You think you can help us by getting to Cherokee Yard?\" The worker looked at me and thought for a moment. \"Well...I can see that you four are in need of some help. Tell ya what, I will get your diesel hooked up to an Eastbound freight train that is heading to Cherokee Yard. There is a grain train heading that way; it is located on track four over there.\" He pointed to where the train was. \"Anyway, what are you kids doing with sure an old piece of machinery?\" \"Well...\" I started. \"We are actually trying to get to Tulsa so that we can meet up with my brother there so he can help us find a way to get to Washington D.C. Is there any trackage the BNSF owns in the Eastern United States?\" \"I'm afraid that there is not. However, I think you might be able to sneak onto a CSX or Norfolk Southern freight train in Chicago or St. Louis. If ya go with the NS, you might be able to get to the Roanoke Locomotive Shops where they might be able to repair your GP7.\" \"Thank you sir. We really are thankful for your help. Would you like to join us on our adventure? We are heading to D.C. to complete one of the steps to get us set for our adventure.\" \"Oh why not? I will have to tell my boss here that I am gonna have to head East into Norfolk Southern and/or CSX trackage.\" he soon radioed a friend. \"Hey Sparrow! This is Foxlock over?\" \"Roger Foxlock! This is Sparrow. What do ya need?\" \"I need a caboose added to the freight train on track four and a diesel added. We got some kids here that need to get to Cherokee Yard on the double over?\" \"Affirmative! There is a caboose on track seven at the East end of the yard. I see some smoke coming out of the GP7 beside you; you need a diesel to come and move it for ya?\" \"Yes over.\" \"Alright I got someone on the way. A SD75M with old ATSF colors number 219 over.\" \"Thanks Sparrow. Over and out.\" I climbed out of the cab and examined the engine. I opened the side panel a big could of black smoke puffed out and covered my face. I cleared it away and saw two big problems. \"Blast! Our radiator is busted! That means our engine will overheat as we can't refill water. Well that is even worse; parts of the engine is shot. She won't be moving an inch under her own power now until we get her fixed.\" Just then, a diesel in old ATSF colors showed up and we coupled our diesel to it and hooked it to the rear of the train. Just then, a small switcher, a SW1500, switched a caboose to the back of our locomotive with our new friend on board. We unloaded all our bags and equipment into the caboose and settled in. I gotta say, the caboose's interior was amazing. Glenn and Reginald climbed into the dome part of the caboose while I stayed inside, looking at some more notes and information that would be essential to finding Atlantis. Our new friend, whose name is Bryan Vinson, called the lead locomotive and told him that we were ready to go. I soon heard a loud horn in front of us and now we started on our way. We figured out that our train would become larger when we reach Perry, there we would have to pick up some more grain cars and would most likely be a problem as we have a caboose attached to the train. luckily, before we left, a mechanic joined us and she would try to fix the locomotive as we headed to Perry. She is short, young; at the age of 19, has short black hair, brown eyes, hispanic accent, and is kind of a loud mouth. her her name is Kelly Navarro. She is quite serious about her work, as I would find out 20 minutes after we departed Enid. \"Hey Blanco!\" she shouted. \"Don't tell me you mean me do ya missy?\" I asked. \"Who else would I be talking to Blanco? Yes you! Now get over here.\" \"Yeah yeah I'm coming.\" I said as I came over to her outside. \"What do you need?\" I asked her. \"I need you to some of my tools and some parts in the caboose. They are a washer and a hammer.\" \"Alright. I'll get it.\" I went and got her the tools and then came back. \"Here you go.\" \"Thank you blanco.\" I headed back to the caboose and started looking over and studying the Atlantean language, and some other foreign languages as well; mainly French, German, Italian, and some Latin. I studied for another 20 minutes straight until I decided to take a nap. I rested for a while until we finally reached Perry. I somehow managed to stay asleep as a new diesel switcher, a 3GS21B, shunted the rest of the grain cars to the train and finally added our GP7 and the caboose back to the train. We started heading East again as we passed through Pawnee and started heading down the old Santa Fe the rest of the way to Tulsa. We managed to arrive there in two and a half days, which was earlier than expected. We pulled into Cherokee yard in the bright afternoon of the day. We were super excited to be there. The only problem is is that my brother hasn't arrived yet. So, we had no choice but to wait for him to arrive. A switcher arrived and shunted our locomotive and the caboose to a siding and they sent our GP7 to the road shops to try and get her working again. The grain train was dispersed to other trains being transported to other places. We waited around for a day not doing much and I studied more of the Atlantean way of life, but mainly their language the most. Finally, I saw a train pull in that have just came from Texas and was being pulled by a diesel that should've been retired back in the 90's; that diesel is an old FP45. I looked at the cab and saw that it was my brother in the cab. I ran over to see him and he was happy to see me. \"I thought those diesels have all been retired brother?\" \"They are...this one has just finished its service and is gonna probably be scrapped. It was nice to use such an old piece of equipment again.\" \"We arrived to Enid in an old GP7 that was abandoned in the yard at Grand Bluffs. She broke down on us as we arrived in Enid at the big yard, but we met some cool and polite people.\" \"So...why are you trying to get D.C.?\" \"You may think this sounds crazy brother.\" \"Well no crazier than using an old diesel to get to a big railyard full of equipment and stuff.\" He teased. Yeah...Good point.\" I replied. I regained my composure and decided that I must tell the people helping me my plan. \"Okay everyone.\" I said to them. \"Gather around the table here and please don't be shy.\" Everyone sat down at the table in the caboose as I stood there about to discuss my plan. \"My brother and I have an important relative that we admired for a long time. He is Naval Officer Camdyn Bradley. He volunteered for an exploration headed by Professor Milo J. Thatch in 1914. It was said that he and the group found the lost continent of Atlantis. People put this story off, saying it is a hoax and I was made fun of because of this; and I hate this so much. I wanna prove that the stories I was told are not false and that Atlantis actually does exist. However, there is one essential piece to the puzzle that we must have; otherwise we will be on a wild goose chase. What we need is the Shepard's Journal. This journal is the key to finding Atlantis. Sadly, it is in a Smithsonian museum, but I found out that it is gonna be moved to the Library of Congress soon and so this is a limited window to get a hold of the journal. You might think I am crazy for trying to steal this journal; however, this journal is important to finding Atlantis. This task is gonna be dangerous and so I want ya'll to make a choice. If ya don't wanna come on this adventure then please leave the caboose; however, if ya wanna help me then you will stay until the journey's end, I'll leave the decision to you guys.\" I finished and watched everyone. Everyone decided to stay in the caboose and made up their minds. \"Thank you fellas. You are all good friends.\" My brother got back to his locomotive and our diesel and caboose was hooked up to the rear of the train. The locomotive is now in better condition and can run more smoothly now. I helped Kelly hook up the diesel to the train and now we are on our way again. I called my brother, who was in the cab of the lead locomotive. \"Is everything alright back there Howlin' Mad?\" he asked me. \"Everything is set and we are ready to go.\" I told him as I heard a horn from the front and then we sat off into the night, heading for St. Louis. We actually arrived in St. Louis in record time and it took us only three hours to reach the city. However, I failed to mention that we also had some enemies. There was a kid we hated who was rich, a showoff, and was very rude. I beat him up twice after he tried to pick a fight with me in elementary. I was actually praised for that cause he got what he deserved. His name is Willie Maddox. He is rich because his father works for Continental Resources; \"Land thieves and vandals\" Is how I describe them. They sued my family in Watonga to give them our land so that they can drill for oil. We fought them tooth and nail, but we were forced to as they paid police to arrest me and my family. This was the last straw for me. I am sorry if I am getting ahead of myself, but this paints a clear picture about how much I hate Willie and his older brothers, Rodney and Horace. They somehow found out about our plans when we left Grand Bluffs in our GP7 and they tracked us all the way to Enid where they were unable to follow us from there. The night we arrived in St. Louis, I had a phone call. \"Hello?\" I answered. \"Hello Howlin' Sad.\" I knew that voice anywhere. \"What do you want Silly Willie?\" I asked him. \"I saw you and your friends on an old clanker, what ya up too?\" \"Why would you care? You got plenty of clunkers yourself. I mean, look at your brothers.\" \"F##K YOU Howlin' Sad!\" he shouted at me. 'NOW P##S OFF YOU NO GOOD FILTHY RICH SON OF A GUN!\" I hung up on him. My voice woke up Reginald and Glenn. \"Willie?\" asked Reginald. \"Yes Reggie, it is. I think he is following us. What should I do?\" \"Stand up to him Hollis. Like what you did many years ago and we praised you.\" \"Thanks guys. That makes me feel a whole lot better. At least we now will be in a race to find Atlantis. Let us hope that we will beat the land thief. My story is a lot longer from here, but I will have to spare the details for next time. Join me next time for when we head deep into CSX and Norfolk Southern Territory and how we plan to get our hands on the Shepard's Journal to find Atlantis. Fair sailing everyone and may god watch over you.[Chapter 2] We finally entered St. Louis at Midnight. Most of us were asleep except for me as I needed to figure out Atlantean and quickly. We arrived at Luther Yard at one in the morning and we all had to wake up and get something to eat. We went to a McDonalds not far from the yard and we bought ourselves some sausage biscuits. I was eating my breakfast when my brother came into the caboose with some news. \"Hi Brother.\" I said to him. \"What is it?\" \"Well...I got some good news and I got some bad news.\" \"Well...What is the bad news?\" I asked. \"The bad news is is that we have reached the end of the BNSF Trackage and we can't go any further.\" \"Well what is the good news?\" \"The good news is is that we have some paint we can use to paint our GP7 and caboose to look like it is with CSX.\" I climbed out of the cab and spoke to a worker of the CSX. \"Excuse me sir.\" I said to the man and he turned to see me. \"Yes? How may I help you?\" We are trying to get to Washington D.C. with this locomotive so that she can be turned into a museum or maybe work on a scenic railroad. We are wondering if you could help us get there.\" \"I'm afraid that I am not allowed to do that...However, I can let your locomotive assist the train with dynamic braking at the rear as we have a shortage of helpers and cabooses here.\" \"Thank you sir. You wouldn't by chance know anyone who is an expert in geology?\" \"There is one person I know who is in D.C. and I know him quite well.\" \"Thank you sir. I owe you one.\" I went to the cab of the GP7 with my brother looking out the other window. I headed to track 12 where a CSX freight train is waiting for a helper unit. We coupled up to the train and then I sent to the driver of the Dash-944CW that was leading the train. \"Is this train bound for Washington D.C.?\" I asked him. \"Yes it is kid. We will have to make a stop along the way at Pinoca Yard in Charlotte, North Carolina. Then we will arrive at Benning Yard in D.C.\" We climbed into the GP7 and our caboose and now we started on our way down the line. We passed through many cities along the way to D.C. We passed through Nashville. We entered Chattanooga where we passed by the Tennessee Railroad Valley and we saw a steam locomotive being used for an excursion. It was Southern 4501 that was pulling the excursion train with newly restored Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railroad 4-8-4, number 576. The 4-8-4 looked super beautiful. I honked the horn of our GP7 at them and earned a whistle from the two locomotives. We honked the horn again to say goodbye to the locos as they blew their whistles back to us as we disappeared into the sunset heading towards North Carolina. We soon entered Georgia as we had to pass through Atlanta to get to Charlotte. We stopped at Tilford Yard for the main diesels to refuel on oil. While we waited, I saw an Amtrak Passenger train stop at Monticello Station which is not far from Tilford Yard. I looked over and I felt a bunch of rage and hate flow through me. I saw Willie Maddox getting on that train with his brothers Matthew and Logan; They also had some friends with them as well. Granted, they are also bullies, but they are quite smart. their names are as follows: Diana Kidd, Jerry Koch, Mark Holt, and Charles Avery. I mean they aren't terrible people, but they can be rude at times. I called Diana as she and I used to date. \"Hello?\" she answered. \"Hello Diana.\" I replied. \"Holland?\" \"Yes it's me.\" \"What do ya need Hollis?\" she cooed. \"Well...I was wondering why you are with Willie and the Maddox boys?\" \"Wait, How do you know I am with them?!\" \"I am over in Tilford Yard on board a freight train.\" \"I see the train but I don't see you.\" \"Listen to me please Diana. Don't trust the Maddox Boys. They are vial and conniving, and they only care about money and power. Come with my group; come with me.\" \"I will meet you in Charlotte.\" \"Thanks Diana. I'm afraid I have to go now. goodbye.\" \"Goodbye Hollis.\" I hung up the phone as the diesel in front of us honked its horn and we set off into the night again. We arrived in Charlotte at around five in the morning. After we arrived, we uncoupled our GP7 and our caboose from the train. We were in a siding when I saw Diana run towards us. \"Hi Diana.\" I said to her. \"Hi Holland Mad. How are you?\" She asked me. \"Quite alright, but why were you with Willie? He is a snake.\" \"I'm sorry Hollis. He bribed me to go with $500,000.\" \"Jesus. He must have a bottomless pit wallet. Anyway, thank you for coming with us.\" \"Your welcome Hollis.\" She kissed my cheek and I blushed. I went to the cab of the GP7 and started her up. This time, she was purring like a cat. I honked the horn, telling my friends to get on quickly. I started us up and started the journey to D.C. We arrived at around ten in the morning and the sun was up. We stopped at a siding and watched a fast express train fly by us. I went to the caboose and layed out some papers and ideas. \"Okay everyone...The only way we will be able to get ahold of this journal is the steal it while it is being delivered to the Library of Congress.\" \"So how are we gonna steal this thing Holland?\" Reginald asked. \"We Reggie; I think I have a plan.\" And so I started thinking of the plan. \"So they are gonna be throwing a big party to celebrate the Atlantis Exhibit at the Smithsonian. The guards will probably be for focused on the people rather than the book. They probably store it away the same way as the Declaration of Independence. So, I'm gonna sneak in as a guard who is gonna be guarding the book and then snatch it. Once that happens, I'm gonna try and contact you guys and tell ya I got it.\" \"What then?\" Kelly asked. \"I will meet you guys. I want you to be driving something that won't draw attention. There should be a dealership not far from here where you can rent a black van. That shouldn't be able to draw too much attention.\" \"Where do we go after that?\" Glenn asked. \"We will then head to the Whitmore Estate which is not far from D.C.\" We started preparing for it. Kelly and Diana went to the dealership to rent the van for around two days. I put on some western clothes for the party. Reginald dressed up as a security guard since one of his online friends happens to work at the Smithsonian. I soon called Diana. \"Diana. Is everything set?\" \"yes! We are ready to go!\" I then hung up and met up with Reginald by the security door as they started lowering the Shepard's Journal to the bottom area of the museum. Andrea then hacked the security cameras and then I grabbed the book. I put it in my backpack and pretended to have been caught by Reginald. We passed by a guard who saw me and Reginald. \"Who is this?\" he asked us. \"This scumbag tried to steal the Hope Diamond and the Star of Asia Sapphire!\" \"I need the money to feed my family.\" I plead. \"Shut up criminal!\" Reginald shouted at me and slapped me in the face. \"Get him out of here!\" the guard demanded. \"Yes sir!\" Reginald shouted. As we headed out of the museum, I looked at Reginald. \"Did ya have to hit me that hard?\" I asked. \"It has to look convincing alright?\" \"Fair enough.\" We ran over to the van and climbed in. Diana and Glenn were in the driver and passenger seats. The moment we left, Andrea left the server quickly and the security cameras were now working. We drove off into the night. We were all laughing and excited about how this went so perfectly. I looked at Andrea and Reginald and decided to speak to them. \"So Guys. We must now head to the Whitmore Estate. They will know something about this travel we will be going on.\" Soon, We started heading up the road that leads to the Whitmore Estate, but looks a bit more modern than what it did back in 1914. Holding onto the journal, Reginald, Diana, and I walked up to the door and. Reaching my hand out, I knocked on the door. Then, we were greeted by this young, but beautiful woman. She had long black hair, brown eyes, a red silk dress with one of the straps down over her left shoulder. I could've sworn she looked like she was from a 50's movies. She greeted us with a smile. \"Howlin' Mad McCullough.\" She said to me. \"How do you know my name?\" I asked. \"I heard about Captain Bradley. He was quite the brave sailor and a renowned hero.\" \"Thank you Miss...\" I lost my words. \"Kidd...Amanda Kidd. The Great-Great Grandson of Mr. Preston Whitmore is in here waiting for you.\" \"Ms. Kidd, may my friends come in as well?\" \"Why yes they may.\" Soon, we all walked in and were ordered by Amanda to take a seat in the foyer and wait for the descendant of Mr. Whitmore. Suddenly, a man in his early 30's showed up in a rather casual dress. His hair was brown, but was dyed with some green and blue. He had a rather queer smile, but a friendly attitude. \"Nice to meet you Mr. McCullough.\" He walked over towards me and shook my hand. \"please,\" I replied. \"Call me Howlin' Mad.\" \"Albeit, it is nice to meet you Hollis. I'm BMW. Ben \"Morrison\" Whitmore.\" I showed him the journal. \"That is the Shepard's Journal!\" \"This journal is the key to finding the lost continent of Atlantis.\" I told him. \"You really think Atlantis is real?\" he asked me. Shows him the book and he reads it but then looks puzzled. \"You got me a book that is nothing but a bunch of gibberish.\" \"That is because it is a dialect that is no longer in use, but I have studied this for a long time.\" \"Who will even believe you?\" \"My friends do and maybe get the museum to try and fund it.\" \"How you plan to do that, flush your career down the toilet?\" \"How dare you say that to me! Me and my friends are willing to risk everything to try and find Atlantis. We will find it even if we have to rent a rowboat.\" Suddenly, BMW started smiling and then he pushed a button,\" That is exactly what I want to hear, but you might wanna forget about the rowboats. We will be travelling in style.\" Suddenly, I was looking at state of the art equipment from a massive submarine and other machines. \"How long have you had this planned sir?\" \"A long time, and now we are finally ready as you know how to read that book. If you didn't take that book, I was about to buy it with what money I have.\" \"What about the crew and other members? I mean you are gonna need engineers and geologists.\" Kelly smiled as did Bryan when they heard this. I made sure to not leave them out, \"These nice fellas here helped me get to D.C. in the first place. May they please join in the trip?\" \"Yes they may! And to answer your question, we already got a crew and some of the best of the best Geologists and Engineers. Gina Castronovo, Young, but energetic engineer. Jérôme Boutroux, excellent navigator from Brest, France and studied at the École Navale located there. Justinianus Constantinus, welder and demolition expert. He believes in the old Byzantine Empire and so he changed his name to honor Justinian. Catalina Gaona, head of the engineers. Most of these people were trying to find the journal but have had no luck.\" \"Sorry for causing you so much trouble over this book.\" I said. \"That is alright.\" He replied. \"What about or clothes and stuff? We are gonna keep that for sure.\" \"We found the diesel locomotive you came here in and it is right now located in a shed at the yard where you left it. Your clothes have already been delivered to the boat that has the equipment and other cargo that will be needed.\" \"How did you manage that so quickly?\" \"I like to be an efficient man. All we need is someone who is able to translate that journal. Are you all in it, or do ya wanna stay in Grand Bluffs?\" \"When Thaddeus Thatch found that book, he told me this,'Our lives are remembered by the gifts we leave our children.' This Journal was actually a gift for Milo Thatch, but he decided to stay in Atlantis to help rebuild their culture and way of life. So how would you like to finally go see Atlantis for real?\" I turned to my friends and smiled. \"Guys...I know we are miles from home, but this might make us mean something. What do ya'll say?\" they all shook their heads at me and agreed to join me. However, another man arrived and I was disgusted. It was Willie and his friends. \"Willie...\" I retorted. \"Howlin' Mad...\" \"What are you doing here?\" \"I could ask the very same reason.\" Alright you two,\" BMW said. \"C'mon can't we all just get along?\" \"Willie...I'm sorry about the other night while on the phone. I was just upset about what you have been doing to my family.\" \"I'm sorry for all the trouble I have been causing too. I was just doing my job and I forgive you for what you said about my brothers.\" I never would have imagined shaking hands with someone I hate, but we were able to somehow. \"So how did you get to be apart of this mission Willie?\" I asked. \"Well...where do ya think they are getting the oil and fuel for their vehicles?\" \"I'm guessing you are only doing this for the money?\" \"Yeah I'm afraid so.\" \"Fair enough.\" I walked to the window and was a bit upset. \"Hollis?\" \"Is everything okay?\" Diana asked me \"Is this is what it is about Willie? Money? I mean you got plenty of money; why would you need anymore?\" \"We are actually suffering some hardships ourselves Hollis.\" I looked at him in confusion. \"Willie what are you talking about?\" \"Continental fired my dad as they were suffering from people who we asked to drill on their land started suing us and we had to pay them a whole bunch of money and now we are broke. I also found out that my dad is suffering from some kind of new infection or plague. I need the money to save his life.\" \"Now that I understand.\" I told him. \"However, I think we should put our differences aside and focus on the big picture.\" \"I think that is a good idea.\" He replied to me. \"I think I might have an idea of what is wrong with your dad Willie, but I must ask you some questions.\" \"Sure. Ask away.\" he told me. \"What were some of the symptoms? Like what have you noticed about him?\" \"Well,\" he started. \"I have noticed him vomiting at an alarming rate and some parts of his skin have turned blue. That is pretty much it.\" \"I am guessing he is suffering from a mix of Cholera and Flu.\" \"That ain't a good thing is it?\" \"Make sure he stays in voluntary quarantine and make sure he drinks a bunch of water and glucose. Also make sure he isn't anywhere near waste.\" \"I will call him and tell him that.\" Willie replied. \"Anyway...\" I changed the subject. \"BMW. What time do we leave?\" \"The expedition will set sail in two days. Are you in?\" \"Yes we are.\" So, we are now ready to start our adventure to find the lost continent. We had no clue how long it would take, nor the dangers that await. However, that will have to wait for next time. Join me next time as the expedition and I start sailing to find Atlantis and encounter dangers and other creatures along the way. Fair sailing ya'll and may god watch over you.[Chapter 3] \"Well this is gonna be one chaotic, cowboy operation.\" I thought to myself as I watched other people load cargo and all sorts of other equipment onto our ship. The ship we are on is a converted container ship, modified to carry 200 to 300 men on board and all their equipment. She is quite a beautiful ship with quite the amount of space. She is the U.S.S. Duke of Glasgow . However, she is only one of four ships that is apart of our exploration. The other three ships are the H.M.S. Duchess of Cumberland, FS Arc-en-Ciel, and the U.S.S. Sapphire. Sadly, I ate something I probably shouldn't have ate right before getting on board the ship. Let's just say, I had to puke. I don't know why I got sick on board. \"Why did I have to eat watermelon? I don't even like watermelon.\" I said to myself as I watched from the deck of the Duke of Glasgow. Suddenly, I heard a voice on the intercom. \"Attention! All hands prepare to launch!\" I hurried to grab my bags and the journal. I soon ran into Miss Amanda Kidd. \"Oh hello again.\" She said to me. \"Why hello as well. I had no clue you were coming along on this trip as well.\" \"BLONDIE!\" I heard a voice shout. \"Hold that thought Howlin' Mad.\" She replied to me as I watched her walk over to a man in his mid-30's, with long black hair and sideburns, he was also short, and dressed in clothes from the time of the California Gold Rush; well, it looked like he was. \"What have you packed into my wagon here?!\" I saw him look through his stuff. \"What is the problem Porky?\" I saw him open up the wagon to reveal what she had stored in Porkchop's wagon. \"What is this? Tomatoes? We ain't gonna be cookin' no Spaghetti! Lettuce? Why we be needin' this?\" \"Why they are all the basic food groups of course Porky.\" \"Why I can give ya four basic food groups and much for faster than you can say,' callawhosica'. beef, ham, beans, and gumbo.\" I laughed at that when I heard those words. \"Hey!\" I shouted. \"Actually those are food types not food groups ya half a meatball.\" \"Alright ya Southern gits! Let's pack it up and get gone before the sun sets.\" \"Hey Howlin' Mad!\" BMW shouted at me. \"Where have you been? I would like you to meet Captain Jerome \"Bradshaw\" Larson. He had family who served in the 1914 expedition and has served in the Gulf War on board the U.S.S. Missouri.\" I then shook hands with the Captain and smiled at him. \"It is an honor to meet you Captain Larson.\" \"Please,\" he replied. \"Call me JBL.\" \"If ya say so.\" Just then, my brother Morris showed up beside me. \"Is this the captain of the submarine Independence?\" \"why yes it is Morry. This is Captain JBL. By the way Captain.\" \"Yes Howlin' Mad?\" \"How many other submarines will be with us.\" \"Two others. Doncaster and Falkland Eagle.\" \"And we are on the Independence?\" \"Yes we are.\" Attention! All hands prepare for launch. \"Let's get going all.\" I finally said. Suddenly, I saw someone drop a stick. \"Hey! You dropped you dynamite.\" Just then, a middle aged man looked back. He was dressed in a mix of purple and khaki; he also has curly dirty blond hair. He has sideburns and blue-green eyes. \"Thank ya for the help. The name is Justinian.\" I shook his hand. \"Howlin' Mad McCullough. I am gonna help read the journal to lead us the way.\" \"Proud to have you here.\" I grabbed my bags and any other things I feel like I will have to have and climbed onto the Independence. I gotta say, BMW did a very good job of paying these workers, and he must have a very fat wallet. This is quite a massive sub, even for today's standards. I had a feeling though that me and my friends might be in for it sooner or later. I walked around the place and meet up with this rather sweet looking girl. She is about my height, with black hair, beautiful blue eyes, a sweet smile, rather elegant curves *coughs* (Sorry for getting a bit out of hands with describing her. You basically get the idea that she is beautiful.) \"Hello Ma'am.\" I said nervously. \"Ciao Yank.\" she responded back in a cute voice. \"Scusate. Il mio italiano è molto arrugginito.\" I replied back in Italian the best I could \"That is okay Cicognone.\" She smiled at me. My she looks super cute I thought to myself, but I regained my sanity. \"So you are the Chief Engineer Stella?\" I asked making her blush some. \"No Gallinello. I am actually the assistant of the Chief Engineer. Catalina is actually the Chief Engineer.\" \"Sorry for the misunderstanding.\" I blushed in humiliation. \"That is alright Gigino. You are actually kind of Carcina.\" I was surprised that she said that. \"Anyway...\" I said, trying to calm myself. \"I am afraid that I must go and check on my friends. sorry Gina.\" \"That is alright. I guess I will see you later Gallinello?\" \"Of course!\" I replied. I walked around the sub and then I stumbled into a sleeping quarters. I looked around and noticed that there was a French flag on my bed. I reached down to pick one up but then I was stopped in my tracks. I was stopped by a early 30s; he has horizon blue eyes with blond hair, like mine, but his was a lot longer. He seemed to be wearing a sailor's uniform but with the French tricolor on his sleeve. \"Excusez-moi monsieur.\" He replied to me. \"Oh dear did I do something wrong?\" I asked him. \"Non, but you almost messed with my prized flag. This is the flag flown by the former battleship Dunkerque and belonged to my great uncle who died while on board her when it was ordered to help out during the Invasion of Norway in 1940.\" \"I am super sorry for almost ruining it. My deepest apologies.\" \"Cheer up Monsieur. You had no clue and that is not your fault.\" Just then, an African American showed up. \"Have you been giving the kid here a tongue lashing?\" He asked Jérôme. \"Non! I have not Baldwin. He almost accidently sat on my flag I have here. I just didn't want him to ruin it by accident.\" \"Anyway my name is Baldwin. Curtis Baldwin; I am the medical officer here.\" I shook his hand. \"Nice to meet you.\" I told him. Just then, Miss Louis Coleman, our Intercom lady, announced on the com. Would Howlin' Mad McCullough please report to the bridge? \"Sorry I can't stay fellas. You are welcome to come if ya like.\" \"Sure. We would love to see what this is all about.\" I soon met up with my friends and realized that Kelly is not with the group. \"Where is Kelly?\" \"She decided not to go on the trip and look after BMW.\" Bryan said. \"I see. Anyways let us all go to the bridge. I have a feeling that this is very important.\" We all started walking to the bridge and we arrived. I was gobsmacked by this and was at a loss of word. I was then gestured by one of the naval officers to go to the meeting room which is located just above where we were. We walked up there and it looked like a conference room with a projector and table with seats. JBl and Amanda were seated down and the rest of the people that came with me all sat down in a chair except for me. \"I want everyone here to give Mr. McCullough your undivided attention.\" JBL said. \"Alright. I guess we should start this off about what I know so far. Is that okay with you JBL?\" \"Sure Howlin' Mad.\" \"Well...There is still some stuff I am still not sure about. However, I can tell you is that there is a frightening creature that guards the entrance of Atlantis. It is said to be one of the most frightening beasts to ever live.\" I stumbled over to a dry erase board and a chalkboard. \"Sorry...My art stills are very bad and so I am gonna do my best to draw this creature.\" So, I did my best to draw the creature onto the dry erase board. I gotta say it actually wasn't that bad. My friends looked shocked by this creature, but JBL and everyone else didn't seem so surprised. \"What is that thing Hollis?\" Glenn asked. \"This Glenn; This is the Leviathan. It's a mythical sea serpent. He's described in the Book of job. The Bible says, \"Out of his mouth go burning lights, sparks of fire shoot out.\" But more likely it's a carving or, a sculpture to frighten the superstitious.\" \"Sounds like we have our work cut out for us don't we?\" Jérôme retorted. \"Will we have to do any digging or no?\" asked one of the geologists that was in the room. \"I am not sure if we have to do any digging. We might have to later, but not with finding the entrance to Atlantis. Ya see, what the journal here says, and I quote, 'the path to Atlantis will take us down a tunnel at the bottom of the ocean, and we'll come up a curve into an air pocket right here, where we'll find the remnants of an ancient highway that will lead us to Atlantis.' I can't make any promises that we will be digging, but we might have to should there be any blockages along this highway.\" \"I see...\" said the geologist. \"So we might have to drill later on, but not at the start?\" \"I'm afraid I do not know yet good sir.\" I told him. \"I guess we will have to wait and see.\" I then heard Amanda say something to herself. \"Epidemiologist, Historian, Cross Country Runner...I am surprised that he is still single.\" I choose not to say anything as I thought it would have been super rude. I walked over to the bridge and looked out the window, but all I could see was darkness. I was examining all the equipment and was surprised that this was all state of the art. \"Independence to Doncaster over?\" I heard the radioman say. \"Yes this is Doncaster over?\" \"Set course for 2-4-0. 50 degrees down angle.\" \"Affirmative Independence.\" \"I hear ya. Independence out.\" I then looked to the starboard side of our sub and saw the Doncaster. The Captain on board the Doncaster waved at us and we waved back. I was still reading the journal, trying to understand it a little better when I heard the Helmsman shout to JBL. \"Captain?\" \"What is it First Officer McFarland?\" \"Ya might wanna get a look at this.\" \"What is it?\" I then asked, but soon I got my answer when I saw hundreds of different ships from so many eras destroyed and at the bottom of the sea. Suddenly, something caught my eyes. \"Captain look!\" I pointed to a blown up hull. \"Is that the...\" \"Yes it is Mr. McCullough. That is the Ulysses.\" I was at a loss of words to see the very ship my granddad was aboard was now a heap of wreckage. \"What happened?\" I asked. \"let us have so exterior lights.\" Just then, these big lights turned on and showed that there was also other ships sunk. \"Look! That is the Cape Nelson!\" Jérôme shouted. I looked and saw the broken hull of some old World War II era cargo ships. I knew what they were. \"It is indeed the Cape Nelson and the Kastelholm. It was said that they were sunk by U-Boats, but when they were rescued; they were in shock, saying they were attacked by some strange creature that they have never seen before. I am not sure, but I think the Leviathan destroyed them. There is no other explanation.\" I was know trying to imagine what it would be like to be in mortal peril. Little did almost all of us know, we already are. However, That is gonna have to be a story for next time. Join us next time as we enter the entrance to Atlantis and how we encountered the Leviathan. It is quite scary so be careful and say your prayers tonight. Fair Sailing and I hope you all have a Merry Christmas So as you can see, I have finally figured out how to do this part to leave behind a message. I hope you all enjoy this story so far and be sure to leave a like and review. Merry Christmas to all and a Happy New Year.[Chapter 4] As I watched from the bridge, we had no clue that there truly was a monster stalking us. We were still exploring the wreckage of all those ships when JBL asked me to read a part of the journal that would explain something he really cared to know. \" Predeshtem... logtu nug... nah geb.\" \"What exactly does that even mean Hollis?\" Willie asked me. \"It means, and I quote,' Enter the lair of the Leviathan.'\" \"Commander?\" Ms. Coleman said. \"There you will find the path to the gateway.\" \"Commander?\" \"Yes Ms. Coleman. What is the matter?\" \"I seem to be picking up something on the hydrophone and the radar that ya might wanna hear.\" \"Go ahead and put it on speaker.\" I just then heard a click of a switch, meaning she just turned on the speaker. I was frightened by the noise I was hearing. I also knew that this is surely not a good sign. It sounded metal and was loud, like the noise of someone dying, but even worse. \"Ummm...Captain...\" I stammered. \"I think we might wanna prepare for battle.\" \"What is that noise? That surely can't be a school of whales or any other deep sea creature can it?\" \"No sir... It is indeed a deep sea creature, but it is not a school of whales. From the sounds of it, it sounds ten thousand times bigger.\" \"Well.\" Amanda said. \"Whatever it is, it sounds metallic. Is it possible that it is us echoing off the rocks?\" \"I doubt it blondie.\" \"Sir?\" I struggled to say. \"We might wanna get a move on and quickly, or prepare for battle. Whatever that thing is, if it is hostile, we won't stand a chance if we are not unprepared.\" Just then, there was a dreaded silence. The type of silence that you would expect in a horror movie when the killer pops out to attack the protagonist. I was afraid suddenly about the silence. \"I don't like that silence. I have a feeling something is gonna happen.\" \"Well... whatever that was, I think it is gone now.\" Amanda said \"I wouldn't say that just yet Ms. Kidd.\" I told her. \"Helmsman. Hard to port. slow us down to 23 knots and-\" Before he could finish, we heard a loud crash against the Independence and we were sent flying out of control. I heard another loud crash and then; BANG! Another loud crash against the hull of the sub. Almost all of us on the bridge went flying and fell on the rough metal. I had no clue what to think, but watch in horror as I heard JBL give out an order. \"Action Stations! Prepare for Battle!\" I soon felt something grab the sub and I was sent flying on to the glass of the bridge. I looked down and was shocked to see I was actually looking into one of the eyes of the Leviathan. I noticed that it was adjusting itself like a lens to a camera. I soon realized what it truly was. \"Mary Joseph!\" \"What?\" Morris shouted. \"Look!\" I hollered. \"It's a machine!\" I shouted as its eye adjusted again. \"Launch sub pods!\" Amanda shouted. I watched the sub pods head full speed towards the Leviathan and started firing torpedoes at it. \"Direct hit!\" I heard one of the sub pod crew members shout. \"But no damage.\" another one said. I ran over and grabbed the radio. \"Doncaster! Falkland Eagle! We are under attack! We need backup!\" \"Copy Independence. We are launching sub pods to assist.\" Just then, I saw them arrive and hit the Leviathan again. \"We are free!\" I heard JBL shout. \"Full speed ahead!\" I watched from the window as I saw the Leviathan smash and destroy sub pods left and right. \"Torpedo turret! You have the order to fire torpedoes.\" I suddenly saw torpedoes come from our ship and hit the creature. Suddenly, I saw a flash and felt a \"BANG!\" on the Independence. \"Jiminy Christmas! It has weapons!\" I shouted as I saw the dreadful creature tear the Falkland eagle up with a strike of an energy burst. Luckily, some of the smaller vessels were able to escape, but a large number of their crews were not so lucky. I ran in horror to the engineering room and I saw Gina was in trouble. \"Help!\" she shouted as I saw her trapped under a metal beam. I ran over to her quickly and grabbed her. \"I could use some help here.\" I shouted. Suddenly, Glenn and Reginald came and helped me lift the beam off of Gina's legs. \"Glenn! Reggie! Go! I got Gina. Go get ready for possible Evac!\" \"Thank you for saving me Hollis.\" Gina cooed. \"You can thank me later, but we must get you to safety. I saw Catalina run pass us and realized why; I turned around and saw a bunch of spall shooting around me and Gina. I covered her with my body as a rivet struck my head, but I didn't pass out. I carried her to the ladder and helped her up. I followed her after she made it. \"Get me the bridge!\" She shouted. \"Yes Engineering?\" I heard JBL's voice from the radio. \"JBL! We to a massive hit down here and water is filling up the bulkheads quickly. We mustn't let it reach the boilers or us being there when that happens.\" \"How much time do we have?\" \"At least 30 minutes if the bulkhead for the nuclear powersource holds.\" We suddenly heard a loud crash. \"You might wanna make that ten.\" \"What do ya mean Gina?\" \"We are gonna have to evacuate.\" After hearing that, I ran over and grabbed what stuff I will need, but I made sure no harm came to the journal as it was the key to everything. I soon ordered everyone to make it to the evacuation subs. \" All hands abandon ship! I repeat, all hands abandon ship!\" I lead Dr. Baldwin, Gina, Diana, Morris, Glenn, Reginald, Andrea, Willie, and Willie's friends to the first evac sub and started helping whoever I could to the others. I also had crew members who knew how to pilot the evac subs arrive to those subs as well so that they would be ready to go. I soon saw Amanda, JBL, and the rest of the bridge crew arrive into our evac sub and we were now away just as the Leviathan shot our sub again. We pulled out of the Independence just as it exploded and two evac subs went with it. I watched in horror as I saw the other evac subs from the Falkland Eagle get smashed and destroyed. Doncaster was still holding strong against the Leviathan as the other sub pods kept distracting it. I grabbed a radio and contacted the Doncaster. \"Doncaster! get out of here! You don't stand a chance against that thing!\" \"Negative! No one is gonna get left behind!\" I watched as more torpedoes pounded the Leviathan again, but did no damage. I watched as another energy blast tore right through the Doncaster and tore it to shreds with every single hand losing their lives except for this in the sub pods. We were all horrified by this, but did my best to stay calm. \"Where do we go now Holland?\" JBL asked me. \"A giant crevice of sorts.\" I then pointed. \"There! There is our way in! Break for it!\" \"All vessels make your mark down angle 20 degrees!\" \"Roger, Copy! 20 degrees down angle!\" We then dove for the trench just as the Leviathan made a swing, destroying three sub pods launched from the Doncaster. \"Go!\" I heard one of the Doncaster sub pods reply on the radio. \"We will hold it off while you guys get to the air pocket. We will follow you from behind! We promise.\" \"Affirmative!\" I heard our radioman shout. \"Godspeed!\" \"I can't shake it!\" I Can't FIZZZZZZ.\" I heard one of the sub pod pilots shout before the radio went dead. We managed to get to the crevice, but it was still chasing us as it fired energy bolts at us and destroyed one of the evac subs. \"AHHH WE ARE ALL GONNA DIE!\" I heard one of the crew members shout. \"Keep it together young man. We will be fine.\" I watched as another sub pod blew up and crashed into the third evac sub and destroyed it. We kept going down and saw the glass on the front start to crack and then we started going up. We made it to the air pocket, but at a heavy cost. I knew that the sub pods fighting the Leviathan wouldn't last long and so I grabbed the radio. \"Evac sub to red one Over?\" \"FIZZZZZZZZZ\" \"Red one this is evac sub Theta. Please respond over?\" \"FIZZZZZZZZZ\" \"They are dead.\" Gina said. \"All of them.\" I saw that she was starting to cry. I had a feeling that this is bad. I walked over to her and tried my best to comfort. \"Shhhh. It's okay Gina.\" I told her. \"I wish it was Ragazzo. However, I just lost my grande fratello.\" \"Your big brother?\" I asked. \"Si...\" she sniffled and start crying again, but she had her head buried into my chest. I stroked her hair to try and make her feel better. I looked around and realized something. \"Glenn...Reginald?\" \"Yes? What's wrong Hollis?\" \"W-w-w-w-where is Morris?\" \"Your brother?\" \"Yes.\" \"I saw him leading crew members to the evac subs and tried to board one.\" \"However,\" one crew member spoke up. \"He sacrificed himself to save me and to save others.\" \"So...he...didn't make it?\" I asked. Everyone nodded their heads at what I said and I felt like my whole world had just been shattered. \"Why...WHHHYYYYYYYY!\" I shouted from the top of my lungs and broke down into tears. I have never felt so lonely after I lost my mom and dad. I just felt like I have just been stabbed with a knife and had no hope of healing. I tried to calm down, but me and Gina have just suffered personal loss. I looked over and saw Willie was broken. I realized that he just lost his younger brother, Horace. I saw him and his older brother, Rodney hug each other in despair. I knew us having a breakdown would not solve our situation. \"Lets...\" I sniffled. \"Let's get to land.\" I told JBL. We all climbed out of the evac sub; as did the others from the other one and of the four sub pods that survived from the Independence. I looked and saw Jérôme and Justinian climb out of one of the sub pods. I watched as all the other crew members lit a candle and sent it adrift in the cave. As for me, I pounded a cross into the ground and wrote my brothers name on it. \"Ten hours ago, we started this expedition with 1,000 of the finest men and women. There are only 60, of us now. I am not gonna be sweet and show sunshine about this all. We are in dire straits. However, we have been through a whole lot worse than this. I understand the grief we all have suffered; lost parents, lost siblings, and friends gone too soon. Nevertheless, We must not quit. If they were here, alive or not, they would want us to continue and finish what we started. From now on, everyone, including me, must do double the work. Everyone drives, everyone works, no one complains, no one slacks, and no one will be left behind. From what I see, our only hope for survival rests with you 'Howlin' Mad'. You and that little book.\" \"Well then let's get to work; right sir?\" I asked. \"That is right Holland.\" JBL told me. \"Ms. Kidd, lets get this convoy moving.\" \"Yes sir! Jérôme, you drive the equipment. Gina, you got the oiler and Justinian is with the drill and will help Mr. Bremerton.\" I was messing with one of the trucks when JBL came up to me. \"Are you sure you know what you are doing?\" he asked me. \"Of course I do.\" I told him. \"I know how to drive, I'm not some fool.\" \"What about driving a semi?\" \"I will struggle with that as I am not use to driving those.\" \"That is good. Now let's get going.\" We were now on our way down this massive highway to head for Atlantis. We had no clue how long the journey would take, nor have any idea what dangers we will encounter. However, that is a story for another day. Just me and the rest of the crew next time for one of the longest and more insane journeys of all time, and get to know some of the other crew members and some of their backstories. Fair sailing everyone. So there ya go, chapter four for Atlantis. Sorry about this being short; I did the best I could because I am still rusty with telling stories. I hope you enjoy this and be sure to leave a review and tell me what ya think and some ways to make this better than what it is. So failing sailing everyone and Merry Christmas.[Chapter 5] Let me just say that the journey on this highway was not without detours and/or delays. So I am gonna have to try my best to explain what happened along the journey through these caverns and other areas. This part of the story takes part as we travel up the massive pass that kind of reminded me of Kicking Horse Pass in Canada with the famous \"Spiral Tunnels.\" I have been helping Jérôme map the place out as he was the expert in mapping. \"So what do you think we should name this pass?\" I asked him. \"le Route de Poimasse?\" He asked. \"Nah. that is to complex. Plus, who is gonna remember that name?\" \"Good point Holland.\" he told me. \"I would probably name it Butchers Pass or Devil's Back Pass.\" \"Let us go with Devil's Back Pass.\" \"Sounds like a good idea.\" I told him. I then heard someone shout for me down the pass. \"Holland!\" I recognized the voice, it was Gina. I headed down the spiral pass and was next to her. \"What is the matter Gina?\" I asked her. \"The transmission to my truck has been shot. It isn't gonna be moving anytime soon.\" \"Hey!\" I shouted. \"I need a tow down here. Shot transmission.\" Just then, a flatbed truck arrived and started towing her truck up the pass. She was smiling at me and looking at me in a rather pleasant way. I was surprised that we were still not even halfway up the pass until we reached a small section of the pass. Jérôme noticed that as well and had a grim look on his face; I could tell that he was upset. \"What is the matter?\" I asked him. \"We are not close to the end of the pass. I fear we will be here for a while.\" \"Don't worry Jérôme.\" I told him. \"We will make it.\" Suddenly, I heard from the radio of my truck a crackle. \"... - ... -.-.- / - ... .. ... / .. ... / ... ..- -... / .-. - -.. / -. ..- - -... . .-. / ...- / ..-. .-. - - / -.. - -. -.-. .- ... - . .-. -.-.- / .- . / - .- -.. . / .. - -.-.- / .-. . .-. . .- - -.-.- / ... - ...\" \"It's sub pod four! They survived the Leviathan!\" I shouted. \"I am gonna send a reply!\" \"Do it!\" JBL said. \" .- ..-. ..-. .. .-. - .- - .. ...- . -.-.- / .- . / .- .-. . / .-.. - -.-. .- - . -.. / ..-. .. ...- . / - .. .-.. . ... / .- ... . .- -.. / - -. / - ... . / .- -. -.-. .. . -. - / ... .. -. ... .- .- -.- -.-.- / - ... .. ... / .. ... / -.-. - -. ...- - -.- / - .- - -.-.- / .- . / .- .-. . / -. - -. -. .- / ... . -. -.. / .- / - .-. ..- -.-. -.- / - - / ... . .-.. .-. / -.- - ..- -.-.-\" \"They will be coming up the highway soon. However, we must send a truck to help them.\" \"Glenn.\" \"Yes Hollis?\" he asked me. \"I need you to take your truck and rescue the crew members from sub pod four.\" \"Sure thing.\" He told me. \"I will get to it.\" We kept climbing up the pass for a while now, but we soon reached a weird crossroads. I examined the book and saw that we must go right as there is a giant scorpion blocking the road on the left. We kept going up the pass until we reached a stiff grade of 5%. This would not be easy for our drill and other heavy equipment to traverse as it was steeper than the rest. I studied the grade and saw that we might be able to do something about it. I noticed that there was a more flatter path where we could be able to still make it, but not have to go up that 5% grade. After passing through one of the spiral tunnels, we made it to a rather open area where I saw old artifacts and other treasures. I was not in this for the money. Oh no, I am in this for the adventure and to clear my granddad's name for being told that he was a mad man. We stopped to eat by some of these artifacts and was served with some pork and beans. The pork was rather good, but the beans had something left to be desired. I was by myself trying to understand the journal even more to try and make sure we are not gonna get lost. \"Hey Hollis.\" I heard a voice shout. I looked to see Gina, eating with some of the crew; notably, crew I have already met. \"Yeah?\" I asked. \"Is something wrong?\" \"No.\" she cooed. \"I would just like for you to come over here and eat with us.\" \"really?\" I asked. \"Si.\" \"Alright.\" I picked up my book and carried my food with me. \"Do you ever put down that book?\" Justinian asked me. Yeah.\" agreed Curtis. \"You must have read that like a thousand times by now.\" \"I know, but something is bothering me.\" \"What is that?\" Gina asked me. \"Why would the Smithsonian start an Atlantis exhibit when most of the head board members dismissed it as a myth? That just doesn't make sense. Why would they dismiss it as a myth, but then make a museum exhibit about it?\" \"I have no clue, but it is a good question.\" Glenn said. I start rubbing my neck. \"You okay there?\" Curtis asked me. \"Yeah, it's just my neck has been bothering me some.\" Just then, he started popping and then we heard a loud cracking noise. \"Better?\" he asked. \"Well...\" I felt it and now it was gone. \"Yeah I feel a whole lot better. Where did you learn that?\" I asked. \"Cheyenne Arapaho Medicine.\" he told me. \"No kidding?\" I asked. \"born and raised. My great great granddad was in the U.S. Army during the times of the Old West and met his wife,\" He then showed me a picture of his great great granddad and mom. I guessed the baby being carried was is great granddad. \"My great granddad there helped the wounded in the Spanish American War and used Ancient Native American techniques to try and battle the 1918 Flu Pandemic that ravaged the world. His sons, that be my grandpa and uncle, served as medics and code talkers in World War II, one in Europe and the other in the Pacific.\" \"That is awesome.\" I told him. \"What about you?\" He asked me. \"Why are you on this journey?\" Everyone then gathered around for me to tell them. \"Well...My Great Great Granddad was actually apart of the Atlantis Expedition in 1914 with Mr. Thatch. He died before I was born but my grandpa told me the stories he told about the place and I told my friends, but they all said, 'You know nothing Howlin' Mad!' Or ,'That is nothing by fairytales.' I wasn't surprised because most of them still believe in the Miasma Theory for diseases. I hated hearing that my Granddad was a liar and that he should go to a retirement home while they still have a room left. I hated hearing that, and so that is why I am here. I wanna prove that what I was told as a kid was true and I am not gonna let anything get in the way of that. However, I am mainly here for the adventure, as are my friends. I guess you all are here for the adventure or just the money?\" \"Money.\" Gina said. \"Money.\" Curtis replied. \"Money.\" Mrs. Coleman snorted. \"Money as well.\" Justinian retorted. \"I would have to say money as well.\" Jérôme hollered. \"I guess I set myself up for that one.\" I whimpered. \"However.\" Gina spoke again. \"I am also in it for an adventure as well.\" \"Well there ya go.\" I replied with a smile. \"Anyway...\"I started. \"I think it be best for us all to get some sleep before we get going again.\" \"I think that is a good idea.\" Catalina replied for a tent. So I walked over and sat up my tent and changed into some for descent sleeping clothes. I turned down the lamp light and started to get to sleep. The next day would be important as well as we would have to traverse a barrier that I don't think any of us were expecting after the attack of the Leviathan. However, that is a story for another day. Fair sailing everyone and may god watch over you. Okay...Sorry about the delay on this one. I have been a rather busy bee with basketball and work for school. However, I should be able to do a good job before the holidays and hopefully start a special christmas one for Thomas and Friends. Like always, be sure to like and leave a review. ","Summary":" \"and in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis, sank beneath the sea\" Plato"},{"Movie":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","Title":"Atlantis: the lost empire genderbender","Author":"breannagabreil","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12868711","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I don't own Atlantis: the lost empire that is owned by Disney. In a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depth of the sea - Plato, 360 B.C. You fool! You've destroyed us all said an Atlantian. The wave is gaining we must warn Atlantis said an Atlantian. Too late said an Atlantian. An atlanian sees the wave and warns the people. Everyone to the shelters Everyone to the shelters said the Atlantian. This way your highness quickly said a Guard. Kedi, come said the Queen. Kedi tries to go back for a toy he dropped. Kedi, just leave it! There's no time said the Queen. Then the queen is summoned by a light above the city. Mother! Said Kedi. Mother! Said Kedi. Mother! Said Kedi. Close your eyes Kedi! Look away said the king. Then Atlantis disappears into the sea.[Chapter 2] I don't own Atlantis Washington D.C. 1914 Good afternoon gentlemen said a female voice. First off, I'd like thanks this board for taking the time to hear my proposal said the woman. Now all have heard about the legend of Atlantis a continent somewhere in the mid-Atlantic was home to an advanced civilization said the woman. Possessing technology far beyond our that according to our friend Plato here was struck by a cataclysmic event that sank it beneath the sea said woman. Some of you may ask why Atlantis said the woman. It's just myth isn't it pure fantasy said the woman. Well, that is where you'd be wrong said the woman. 10,000 years before the Egyptians built the pyramids Atlantis had electricity, advanced medicine even the power of flight impossible you say well no not for them said the woman. Numerous ancient cultures all over the globe believed that Atlantis possessed a power source of some kind said the woman. More powerful than steam than coal more powerful than our modern internal combustion engines said the woman. Gentlemen, I propose that we find Atlantis, find that power source and bring it back to the surface said the woman. Now this is a page from an illuminated text that describes a book called the the shepherd's journal said to be a first-hand account of Atlantis anditss exact whereabouts said the woman. Now based on a centuries-old translation said the woman. Of Norse text said the woman. Historians have believed the journal resides in Ireland said the woman. But after comparing the text to the ruins of Viking shield I found that one of the letters had been mistranslated said the woman. So by changing this letter and inserting the correct one, we find that the shepherd's journal the key to Atlantis lies not Ireland gentlemen but in iceland said the woman. Pause for effects said the woman. Gentlemen said the woman. I'll take your questions now said the woman. Then the phone rang. Oh, would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment said the woman. She answers it. Cartography and linguistics Mila Thatch speaking said Mila. Yeah yeah, a just minute said Mila. Pardon me, said Mila. She does something to the boiler and the goes back to the phone. How's that? Is that better? Asks Mila. Uh-huh. Yeah, you're welcome said Mila. Then she hangs it up. She goes back to her lecture, Now, as you can see by the said Mila. By this, um, map. The map that I've drawn said Mila. I plotted the route that will take myself and a crew to the southern coast Iceland to retrieve the journal; said Mila. Then she looked at the clock. Ah, show time said Mila. Well, this is it said Mila. I am finally getting out of the dungeon said Mila. She picks up a photo of her as a girl and an old man. Then she opens a cabinet with an explorer's hat and puts it on. Then a letter comes down a chute. she read it What?! Said Mila. Then another letter came. she read it They can't do this to me said Mila. Scene changes to another part of the building. I swear the young Thatch gets crazier every year said a man. If I ever hear the word\" Atlantis\" again, I'll step in front of a bus said man 1. I'll push you said man 2. Mr. Harcourt said Mila. Good lord said Man 3. There she is said man 3. Members of the board, wait said Mila. How did you find us? Asks Mr. Harcourt. Mr. Harcourt, wait said Mila. Head for the hills said man 4. Where is a guard when you need him said, Mr. Harcourt? Mr. Harcourt, you gotta listen to me, sir said Mila. He hides behind a plant. Uh, sir said Mila. Wait! said Mila. Sir, I, I have new evidence that… please, said Mila. Stop! Sir, if you… could you hold… thank you very much! Look at said Mila. This Museum funds scientific expeditions based on facts, not legends and folklore said Mr. Harcourt. Besides, we need you here said, Mr. Harcourt. We depend on you said Mr. Harcourt. You do said Mila. Yes. what with winter coming, that boiler's going need a lot of attention said, Mr. Harcourt. Bolier? Said Mila. Onward, Heinz said Mr. Harcourt. But there… there's a journal said Mila. It's in Iceland! I'm sure of it this time said Mila. Then jumps on the hood of the automobile. Sir, I really hoped it wouldn't come to this, but this is a letter of resignation said Mila. If you reject my proposal I'll whoa said Mila. I'll quit yells Mila. Then the automobile backs up. I mean it, sir said Mila. If you refuse to fund my proposal said Mila. You'll what? Asks Mr. Harcourt. Flush your career down the toilet, just like your grandfather said, Mr. Harcourt. You have a lot of potential, Mila said Mr. Harcourt. Don't throw all away chasing fairytales my dear said, Mr. Harcourt. But i prove Atlantis exists said Mila. You want to go on an expedition? Said Mr. Harcourt. Here. take a trolley to the Potomac and Jump in said, Mr. Harcourt. Maybe the cold water will clear your head. Heinz said, Mr. Harcourt. the car kicks up a puddle soaking her.[Chapter 3] I don't own Atlantis scene changes to Mila's apartment. I'm home said Mila. Fluffy? Here, kitty said Mila Then Mila tired to turn on the light but it wouldn't work. Mila Jane Thatch said a woman. Who… who are you? How'd you get in here? Asks Mila. I came down the chimney. Ho ho ho said the woman. My name is Helga Sinclair said, Helga. I'm acting on behalf of my employer, who has a most intriguing proposition for you said, Helga. Are you interested? Asks Helga. Your… your employer? Said Mila. Who is your employer? Asks Mila. Helga drives her to an estate belonging to Preston Whitmore. This way, please said Helga. And don't drip on the Caravaggio said, Helga. Step lively said, Helga. Mr. Whitmore does like to be kept waiting said, Helga. You will address as Mr. Whitmore or sir said, Helga. You will stand unless asked to be seated said Mila. Keep your sentences short and to the point said, Helga. Are we clear? Said Helga. And relax said, Helga. He doesn't bite… often said, Helga. Mila looks around the room when she sees a picture of her grandfather. Grandpa? Said Mila. Finest explorer I ever met said, Mr. Whitmore. Preston Whitmore said, Mr. Whitmore. Pleasure to meet you Mila said, Mr. Whitmore. Join me in a little yoga? Asks Mr. Whitmore. Uh, no, no, thank you said Mila. Did you really know my grandfather? Asks Mila. Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus back in Georgetown said, Mr. Whitmore. Class of '66. We stayed close friends till the end of days said, Mr. Whitmore. Even dragged me along on some of his danged fool expeditions said, Mr. Whitmore. Thatch was crazy as a fruit bat, he was said Mr. Whitmore. He spoke of you often said, Mr. Whitmore. Funny. He, he never mentioned you said Mila. Oh, he wouldn't. He knew how much I liked my privacy said, Mr. Whitmore. I keep a low profile said, Mr. Whitmore. Mr. Whitmore, I should be wondering why i'm here? Asks Mila. Look on that table said, Mr. Whitmore. It's for you said, Mr. Whitmore. It's… it's from my grandfather said Mila. He brought that package to me years ago said, Mr. Whitmore. He said if anything were to happen to him, I should give to it you when you were ready said, Mr. Whitmore. Whatever that means said, Mr. Whitmore. It can't be said Mila. It's the shepherd's journal said Mila. Mr. Whitmore, this journal is the key to finding the lost continent of Atlantis said Mila. Atlantis said, Mr. Whitmore. I was born yesterday, honey said Mr. Whitmore. No, no, no. look. Look at this said Mila. Coordinates. Clues. It's all right here said Mila. Yeah, looks like gibberish to me said, Mr. Whitmore. That's because it's been in a dialect that no longer exists said Mila. So it's useless said, Mr. Whitmore. No, no, just difficult said Mila. I've spent my whole life studying dead languages said Mila. It's not gibberish to me said Mila. Ah, it's probably a fake said, Mr. Whitmore. Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather would have known said Mila. If this were fake I would know said Mila. I stake everything I own, everything I believe in, that this is the genuine Shepperd's journal said Mila. All right. All right. So what are you gonna do with it? Asks Mr. Whitmore. Well, I'll get funding said Mila. I mean I'll the museum said Mila. They'll never believe you said, Mr. Whitmore. I'll show them! I will make them believe said Mila. like you did today? Asks Mr. Whitmore. Yes! Well, no said Mila. How did you said Mila? Forget about them, okay said Mila. Never mind said Mila. I will find Atlantis on my own said Mila. I mean, if I have to rent a rowboat said Mila. Congratulations, Mila said Mr. Whimore. This is exactly what I want to hear said, Mr. Whitmore. But forget the rowboat, girl said Mr. Whitmore. We'll travel in style said, Mr. Whitmore. It's all been arranged, the whole ball of wax said Mr. Whitmore. Why? Asks Mila. For years, your grandad bent my ear, with stories about that old book said, Mr. Whitmore. I didn't buy it for a minute said, Mr. Whitmore. So, finally, I got fed up and made a bet with the old coot said, Mr. Whitmore. I said \"Thatch, if you ever find that so-called journal, not only I will finance the expedition, but I'll kiss you full on the mouth said, Mr. Whitmore. Imagine my embarrassment when he found the darn thing said, Mr. Whitmore. Now, I know your grandpa's gone, Mila, god rest his soul, but Preston Whitmore is a man who keeps his word said, Mr. Whitmore. You hear that, Thatch? Said Mr. Whitmore. I'm going to the afterlife with a clear conscience, by thunder said, Mr. Whitmore. Your grandpa was a great man said, Mr. Whitmore. You probably don't realize how great said, Mr. Whitmore. Those buffoons at the museum dragged him down, made a laughing stock out of him said, Mr. Whitmore. He died a broken man said, Mr. Whitmore. If I could bring just one shred of proof, that'd be enough for me said, Mr. Whitmore. Ah, Thatch said Mr. Whitmore. What are we standing around for? We got work to do said, Mr. Whitmore. But, Mr. Whitmore, you know, in order to do what you're proposing, you're gonna need a crew said Mila. Taken care of said, Mr. Whitmore. You'll need engineers and geologists said Mila. Got em all. The best of the best said, Mr. Whitmore. Gaetan Moliere, geology and excavation said, Mr. Whitmore. The man has a nose for dirt, Mr. Whitmore. Vincenzo Santorini, Demolitions. Busted him out of a Turkish prison said, Mr. Whitmore. Audrey Ramirez, don't let her age fool you. She's forgotten more about engines than you or I will ever know said Mr. Whitmore. They're the same crew that brought the journal back said, Mr. Whitmore. Where was it? Asks Mila. Iceland said, Mr. Whitmore. I knew it! I knew it said Mila. All we need now is an expert in Gibberish said, Mr. Whitmore. So, it's decision time said, Mr. Whitmore. You can build on the foundation your grandfather left you or you can go back to your boiler room said, Mr. Whitmore. This is for real said Mila. Now you're catching on said, Mr. Whitmore. All right. Okay. I'll have to quit my job said Mila. It's done. You resigned this afternoon said, Mr. Whitmore. I did? Asks Mila. Yep. don't like to leave loose ends said, Mr. Whitmore. Um, my apartment i'm gonna have to give notice said Mila. Take care of said Mr. Whitmore. My clothes said Mila. Packed said, Mr. Whitmore. My books said Mila. In storage said Mr. Whimore. My cat said Mila. My gosh said Mila. Your grandad had a saying said, Mr. Whitmore. Our lives are remembered, by the gifts we leave our children said, Mr. Whitmore. This journal is his gift to you, Mila said Mr. Whitmore. Atlantis is waiting said, Mr. Whitmore. What do you say? Asks Mr. Whitmore. I'm your girl, Mr. Whitmore said Mila. You will not regret this said Mila. Boy, I am so excited, I can't even hold it in said Mila.[Chapter 4] I don't own Atlantis the lost empire Mila gets seasick on a ship. Carrots. Why is there always carrots said Mila? I didn't even eat carrots said Mila. Attention all hands to the launch bay said a voice over a p.a. Then a person jumps in front of her. Excuse me? Said Mila. I need to report in said Mila. Yes, Ms. Thatch said Helga. It's you said Mila. Blondie, I got a bone to pick with you said a man. Hold that thought said, Helga. What is it this time cookie? Asks Helga. You done stuffed my wagon full to bustin with non-essentials said Cookie. Look at all this said Cookie. Cinnamon, oregano, cilantro said Cookie.

I want you meet commander Rourke said, Mr. Whitmore. He led the Iceland team that brought the journal back said, Mr. Whitmore. Mila Thatch said, Rourke. Pleasure to meet the Granddaughter of old Thaddeus said, Rourke. I see you got that journal, nice pictures, but I prefer I good western myself said, Rourke. Pretty impressive, eh said Mr. Whitmore. Boy, when you settle a bet, you settle a bet said Mila. Well, you're grandad always believed you couldn't put a price on the pursuit of knowledge said, Mr. Whitmore. Well, believe me, this'll be a small change compared to the value of what we're gonna learn on this trip said Mila. Yes, this should be enriching for all of us said, Rourke. Mr. Whitmore said, Rourke. Rourke said, Mr. Whitmore. It's time said, Rourke. Bye, Mr. Whitmore said Mila. Make us proud, my dear said, Mr. Whitmore. The crew prepares to dive. Lieutenant, take us down said, Rourke. Diving officer, submerge the ship said, Helga. Aye said Diving officer. Make the depth one-five-zero feet said, Helga. Later Mila finds her cabin. While a woman announced something over the P.A. Then Mila settled on a bunk. Then someone appears from the bunk above. You have disturbed the dirt said a man. Yh, pardon me? Said Mila. You have disturbed the dirt said the man. Dirt from around the globe, spanning the centuries said the man. What have you done said the man? England must never merge with France said the man. What's it doing in my bed? Asks Mila. You ask too many questions said the man. Who are you? Who sent you? Speak up said the man. Me, i'm, uh said Mila. Bah! I will know soon enough said the man. Hey, hey, hey! Let go said Mila, Do not be such a crybaby! Hold still said the man. A-ha! There you are said the man. Now, tell me your story, my little friend said the man. Parchment fiber from the Nile circa 500 B.C. said the man. Lead pencil, number 2 said the man. Paint flecks of a type used by a government building said the man. You have a cat, short haired Persian, two years old, third in a litter of seven said the man. There are all the microscopic fingerprints of the mapmaker said the man. And linguist said the man. Hey, how did you said Mila? This is an outrage said the man. You must leave at once said the man. Out, out, out, out, out said the man. Uh-oh said an African man. Sat in the dirt didn't you said the man. Moliere, now what have I told you about playing nice with the other kids said the man. Get back, I got soap, and i'm not afraid to use it said the man. Back, foul creature said the man. Back to pit from which you came said the man. The name's sweet said, Sweet. Joshua Sweet, Medical Officer said Sweet, Yeah, Mila Thatch said Mila. Mila Thatch, you're my 3:00 said Sweet. Well, no time like the present said Sweet as he takes out a saw. Oh, boy said Mila. Nice, isn't it said Sweet. The catalog says that this little beauty, can saw through a femur in 28 seconds said Sweet. I'm betting I can cut that time in half said, Sweet. Now, stick out your tongue and say ah said, Sweet. Oh, no, really, I have a, ah said Mila. So, where you from? Asks Sweet. Really! I have some family up that way said, Sweet. Beautiful country up there said, Sweet. Do you any fishing? Asks Sweet. Me? I hate fishing said, Sweet. I hate fish said, Sweet. Hate the taste, hate the smell and hate all them little bones said Sweet. Here, i'm gonna need you to fill these up said Sweet. With what? Asks Mila. Will Mila Thatch please report to the bridge said, Mrs. Packard. Thank you said Mila. I mean, nice meeting you said Mila. Then she dashes out the cabin. Uh-huh, nice meeting you, too said, Sweet.[Chapter 5] I don't own Atlantis Scene changes to Mrs. Packard station. So I say to him \" what's wrong with my meatloaf\" and he says to me said, Mrs. Packard. Oh. hold on a second, Margie, I got another call said, Mrs. Packard. Sir, we're approaching coordinates said, Mrs. Packard. Voice- over: Hello, Margie, yeah so, anyways, he says said Mrs. Packard. Voice-over: all right, let's have a look around said, Rourke. Voice-over: aye sir said, Helga. Voice-over: set course to two-four-zero said, Helga. Voice-over: 15 degrees down angle on the bow planes said, Helga. Voice-over: come right two-four-zero said, Helga. Welcome to the bridge, Ms. Thatch said Rourke. Okay, everybody, I want to give Ms. Thatch your undivided attention said Rourke. Good afternoon said Mila. Can everyone hear me okay? Asks Mila. Uh said Mila. Okay, how about some slides… said Mila. The first slide is a depiction of a creature said Mila. A creature so frightening that sailors were said to be driven mad by the mere sight of it said Mila. Geez, I used to take lunch money from girls like this said a Hispanic girl. Okay, this is an illustration of the Leviathan, the creature guarding the entrance to Atlantis said Mila. With something like that, I would have a white wine, I think said an Italian man. It's a mythical sea serpent said Mila. He's described in the book of job said Mila. The bible says… \" out of his mouth go burning lights, sparks of fire shoot out\" said Mila. But more likely, it's a carving or a sculpture to frighten the superstitious said Mila. So we find this masterpiece said, Rourke. Then what? Asks Rourke. When do we dig? Asks Moles. Actually, we don't have to dig said Mila. You see, According to the journal the path to Atlantis will take us down a tunnel at the bottom of the ocean and we'll come up a curve into an air pocket right here where we'll find the remnants of an ancient highway that will lead us to Atlantis said Mila.

","Summary":" I don't own Atlantis: the lost empire that is owned by Disney. In a single day and night of misfort"},{"Movie":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","Title":"Survival mission","Author":"Deadly Ice 88","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12734307","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is my first fic, and I decided to do it from one of my favorite movies and a character that I really liked. Atlantis is not my property, I only write for fun and entertainment. It happens in the events of the final battle, when Milo and the Atlanteans go to rescue Kida. Originally, this chapter was published on November 13, 2017, but on June 24, 2018, I decided to improve in certain aspects, to see what you think of these new improvements. Chap. 1. Treason and escape At the base of the volcano, the battle was devastating between the two sides, neither gave way to the other, the soldiers were too trusting when the Atlantic shot nothing more arrows and even more when they began to hunt in their small planes, but all change when the Atlantic in their flying weights, they were shooting energy rays. As time passed, the Atlanticists began to defeat them. But in the Gyro - Evac, a big balloon that was in the middle of the battle, and that the planes were protecting because there was their cargo and leaders, the commander and the lieutenant were firing at everything that approached them. But before they knew it, a flying fish squeezed against one of the balloons that made it rise and take height. The commander realized that they were going down quickly, decided to take action. -We lose height !, lighten the load! - Rourke gave orders to Helga, and she starts to throw what has weight, although they only had little cargo and it was not going to be enough for the balloon to rise, Rourke knew it perfectly and He thought quickly about a plan, until something came to mind, he gave a smile and slowly began to approach and stand behind Helga. Helga with much effort threw the last tank of fuel, but still, it was not enough to raise it again. -It's all !, unless you want to jump- saying it sarcastically while pushing her hair back by the discomfort she felt right now, so concentrated and annoyed was that she did not realize that Rourke was behind her. -The ladies first- Rourke saying as he took Helga's arms with great force and he throws her out of the Globe. - NO! - Helga exclaimed surprised and scared to feel as he lifted her and threw her outside, luckily, instinctively he extended his arms and managed to grab the railing under the platform on which they were, almost his feet touched the propellers that were under it. He stayed a few seconds reflecting what had just happened, and when he did, with a great anger that was inside, Helga rocked back a bit to gain momentum, doing so managed to climb, to hit in the face to a Surprised Rourke with his two feet and knocked him down, and while he was recovering from the blow on the floor, she saw him very furious. -You said we were in this together! - When she finished saying it, she kicked him in the face twice. -You promised me a percentage! - Helga said it very angry, as she prepared to give him a circular kick and with more force, but when he was about to connect her, Rourke grabbed the leg, and seeing that he was holding her, he got up . - Next time, ask for it in writing! - Saying it when he was already up, he breaks the leg that has the grip, and to top it, the spear on the side of the top of the railing, far enough so that she could not hold on. -ROURKE! - Helga shouted as she fell uncontrollably, her braided hair untied, and in the midst of the air, she started spinning uncontrollably. \"It's nothing personal!\" Helga listened as Rourke yelled mockingly, which further increased her anger. And while he was spinning uncontrollably, I try to focus his eyesight, and when he did, at least he noticed, he saw that he was almost going to hit the solid floor of the volcano, and the next thing that happened ... ... it sounded like a dry blow coming from his body when hitting the ground. Rourke saw the fall of Helga very satisfied, happy and without any regrets for his actions, since as predicted, the Gyro-Evac began to rise, and therefore, when it came to the surface, it would be totally millionaire, and to be honest When they reached the surface, he would cause an \"accident\" to Helga, so that he would be even more millionaire than he would have been. But his happiness did not last when he heard a strange noise, and turned just to see Milo hanging on a rope and hit him in the face. While that was happening, almost under them, we can appreciate Helga, she is down the floor of the cavern, her face is on the left side, anyone who saw her, would think she was dead as she did not move or emitted no noise, but surprisingly, his fingers began to move a little ... POV by Helga All I see is only darkness, and all I feel is an unbearable pain all over my body, the only thing I hear is the sound of the bullets from the planes, but these are slowly disappearing, I can only open one Little my eyes to see that I was face down on the floor. I can not believe that I'm still alive, if I know I'm strong, I've strengthened my body throughout my life, but to recognize it, a fall that high would kill anyone instantly after the crash, but I remember that face From mole I had mentioned that the ashes of the volcano, it was a very soft rock, that cleared my doubts. I stay awake and only because of the pain and agony I had in my body; A hundred as almost all my ribs were broken, my leg is totally unused and broken by Rourke. Rourke ... I can not believe what he did to me, we were supposed to be a team! He and I were going to be rich! We were going to divide 90% of the cost of all the riches, and I increased my percentage more when Audrey, Vynni and the others left the team !, and 10% was going to be for those soldiers that Rourke brought and he offered them, to change their loyalty and not say where they got all the money ... ... and although we met long ago, he betrayed me, and the worst I try to get rid of my back. With the help of my left arm, very slowly because I feel my arm tremble with pain, I slowly manage to turn and lift my body a bit on the left side, moan of pain, although I do not want to complain, I can not help it, my whole body ached and when turning I felt my back had also been badly hurt, with my blurred vision, I see vaguely as Rourke was getting closer to the exit ... ... my hatred towards him is intense, now that's the only thing that kept me going still awake, lying on the ground, I barely realize that when we left the city of Atlantis, the last thing Rourke said to others was \"more for ME\", the one he was sure was planning when we came to the surface, get rid of me so that he would touch almost all the money we were going to get, he only saw me as his puppet and I allowed him to be ... that provoked in me an infernal hatred towards him. I'm not going to let him get away with his, before he died, letting him still alive ... although it's ironic that he thinks about it, because I feel like every pain beats weakly in my body ... I feel like I'm dying ... .. but better I put aside my thought, I give a sigh and I start to turn to face up, although doing so, I feel my ribs move, causing my torso to start to hurt even more than I could already feel, what again I groaned in pain, but as you turn, with my left arm I started to take out my flare gun that I had kept by my pants, luckily it did not fall. When she is on her back, she is ready to shoot him, but I felt my arm begin to tremble with pain. What's wrong with me? My gun is not so heavy, but now I feel like I'm carrying a ton! My chest to concentrate my strength, I feel ready, I raise my arm to aim, but this time with my right arm supporting my left arm, and I try to open my eyes a little more, as I do so I can vaguely see my objective, I have I had to hurry to shoot since my goal was fading. -It is nothing personal- I murmur the last words he told me, and with my blurred vision, shoot my target, I see how he gives it, which causes everything to explode and begin to fall into a tailspin. I gave a smile of satisfaction, something forced and painful, my arms can no longer support the effort applied, and these fell to the ground, I begin to breathe forcefully and agonizingly, because when I do, my chest explodes with pain and suffering ... .. Although I try to move to a safe place, my body does not even react, I am too sore and tired to do it. I begin to complain of pain silently, I feel my eyelids become heavy and little by little, I begin to close my eyes, although I want to make sure that Rourke died in the explosion of the balloon, my fatigue no longer allows me to open my eyes, not even to stay awake, I start thinking about a plan to get out of here, and now the only way I can get out of my situation in which I find myself, is in two ways: Try to drag me to a safe place so I can recover from my wounds and be able to rest better, but I know very well that it will be impossible, I feel like I'm starting to faint because of how weak I feel and my body does not react, I can not even open my eyes once more. And the other is that someone find me and help me ... .ja, as if that were possible, everyone is focused on the battle, and although the Atlantics find me, neither Milo nor the others, they will not forgive me for my actions. , try to remove the source of life of the entire town of Atlantis ... ..my actions have no forgiveness, but for the moment I stop thinking and turn my head sideways to try to feel more comfortable and my head does not tire so much . I feel like I am losing consciousness, I have a hard time breathing, I Helga Katrina Sinclair, a 30 year old woman, eldest daughter of six brothers, a soldier who has fought all my life ... ... I will die here, and the worst of everything, it was provoked by an act of treason and cowardice, I have always said, that the only way to die for a soldier with a great honor like me, would be in combat. But I will not surrender ... ..I am going to face the very death, I will keep fighting to keep myself alive ... I know ... I still have a lot to live ... ..I am strong ... in determination, mentally and physically ... I'm not going to let him die this way, but when I'm about to faint from the pain, I can hear how there are some running steps, the strange thing is that they are not very far from me, but I can not endure more pain and then, I do not hear anything anymore. POV. From ? (Minutes before the explosion) I am not a mercenary, I am a soldier ... although my actions speak for themselves, because what I am doing has no forgiveness, I am shooting at people we all thought had died millions of years ago, to keep them away from our load, which contains the source of life of all that civilization, although I do not want to participate in all this, I would have liked to be on the other side ... but, I have no choice, the commander offered us a lot of money to all for loyalty, although the truth all my colleagues thought about themselves, I do not, because if my part I will not use it for my ... .. ... if it will not be for her. I'm on top of one of the vehicles, shooting everything that came close to the Globe, although the truth is that my conscience was not completely concentrated, since I can not repress my actions, then when I look up, I see how one of them flying fish crashed into a balloon that helped raise the Gyro -Evac, which caused it to begin to lower its height, I would have continued to see, if it were not for a blow from my partner who had beside me made me react. -Don't get distracted! - I scream very annoyed and this again began to shoot, I also started shooting, although I know very well that our current situation is very bad, since everything is against us, because when Atlantes destroyed the car that helped to raise the planes that we had, they began to dominate us. But I heard in the middle of the bullets, a sharp blow, as if something had hit very hard, stop shooting and turn to where I heard the blow, came from a small hill that was up, and when I decide to go and investigate what was that noise…. - What are you doing! - Again I heard the mercenary shout again but when he turned to see me, he did not realize that a ray of those flying fish was going against us. - Careful! - I shout and managed to react to get rid of the vehicle, before the lightning hit the car and exploded, the force produced by the explosion was not much but enough to get me away from the vehicle and I felt like I started to roll When I stop rolling, I feel my eardrums tremble with pain, I let my pain fall apart and when I return to normal, I feel now how the gas in my mask comes out, apparently broke and is now useless. I take off my mask and also the gas tank, I give a few small breaths and I get up to see how we were doing, and I saw that nobody was there, almost everyone is dead, I thought about going to look for someone ... ... but I recognize that this will not change anything, what happened next was that I hear a big explosion, and when I look up, I saw with horror that the Gyro -Evac was burned, and began to descend in flames. When I was thinking that the Commander and the lieutenant were upstairs, I worried about them, but in my mind, a memory started to surface when there was a conversation between the doctor and the excavator. \"The magma, solidified at the base of the volcano, completely blocking the exit\". \"Awaits explains ... you mean that this volcano can explode at any moment\" \"Oh no no nono, it takes a great destructive force of great magnitude, to wake up\" As I remembered that conversation, I started to worry, if the Gyro-Evac would crash on the surface of the volcano, engulfed in flames ... .. meaning that, the volcano was going to erupt when it crashed. Quickly, I begin to think of a plan, I raise my eyes and see in the chasm that I had heard the blow before, as there are some small caverns higher in the chasm, maybe the lava does not arrive, I already have at least one idea, and when I look down at the ground, there was a backpack, I bend down to see what I had, and I saw that it has very useful things that could be useful, I put the backpack on my back and start running to the chasm, once in a while I turn up to see how the Evac, kept falling, but in the middle of my path, turns to side, and what I saw left me speechless, on the floor is a slender woman, fair skin, long blond hair, has a mole Under the left eye, lips painted red, she has a white tank top, tight green trousers, gloves and brown boots, she was undoubtedly Lieutenant Sinclar, and she was somewhat deviated from the chasm. I know very well that if I strayed, maybe I can not reach my goal in time, but I can not ignore the lieutenant, so I decide to go with her. I quickly, I go down a little and I start running where she was, I was wondering what she was doing here, when I am already at her side, I notice with concern that she is unconscious and that she is not breathing very well, her breathing is very rough, too I notice that his face reflects pain and also how his left leg was totally out of place. I worry a lot and put my head to his chest, and I lean my head gently on his chest, where she has her heart, and it anguishes me much more, since I barely hear it. I walk away a little, and I begin to wonder if I should leave it, since there is not much time left for the balloon to hit the surface, and it could only delay me ... ... but I quickly remove that idea, I have never stopped no one behind, any of the mercenaries would leave her so they can be saved, anyone but me. I bend over to grab a firefighter's style, but I barely touch his torso a little to accommodate myself, I see how she showed an expression of suffering, and she twisted a little, I could understand that she must have some broken bones in her thorax ... and they should be very serious. Now with much more care, I put one of my arms around his back and the other in his knees flexing, already prepared the lift very carefully, are already fully up, the lieutenant being unconscious, his head and his long hair began to hang down, I began to make sure that she was a little comfortable and that her thorax did not move so much, I start to go at a moderate speed, not so slow to be able to arrive in time to the chasm, but neither so fast to keep the lieutenant from suffering even more, but suddenly, I feel like all the ground began to move, that only means one thing ... the volcano is waking up and I see that, since I feel the hottest soil, now I increase my speed a little more, I see how everything was already showing magma, and I turn back, and I only see how some flying fish started to go quickly, although one stayed behind the others. I ignore all that when I felt how the earth moved, being a bit in the chasm, I see a big cavern, so I decided to go there, I was almost inside the cavern, I see some rocks falling from above, I managed to react in time to avoid being crushed to me and my lieutenant, but then I feel like my body and that of the lieutenant, we were pushed in, and then I begin to see everything black ... End of the Chapter What's up? How did I do it? Was the beginning okay? Thank you for reading the beginning, any suggestions you have, I am open for ideas. I hope you liked the improvements I made in the chapter. Greetings and see you.[Chapter 2] Once again welcome to this story, keep enjoying reading it and if you have any comments or questions, you can tell me with confidence. Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap. 2 Past It was night, and the weather was raining, we saw a somewhat neglected building, in a small apartment, more specifically in one of its rooms, there was a young man packing clothes in a backpack, this young man is between 23, skin semi dark, brown eyes, military-style black hairstyle, he had a green beije clothes, while still keeping his backpack, he thought about the mission that would soon go, in the words his commander said days before . - \"We will go to Atlantica, when the old man can find the linguist who can read this book, therefore rest in their homes, and do not talk with anyone about the discovery ... those who follow me, will have their whole lives insured and neglected, there will not be any injured in the expedition \" He thought it was the perfect opportunity that he had expected so much, he urgently needed the money, and when Commander Rourke mentioned that there would not be any wounded, he did not think twice and accept it. When he was sure that he had everything for the trip, he left the room and started walking in a small corridor that led to the kitchen, and when he arrived at the kitchen, he grabbed a piece of bread, and broke it. But when she broke it, someone lit a lamp that was nearby, the one that lit her was a woman between 40 years old, fair skin, brown eyes, of medium height, and black hair tied. When the young man realized who saw him, he left the pieces of bread where he was. - \"So ... ..you'll leave\" -the woman said neutrally. - \"Yes ... .and they are not slow to come for me\" - he said seriously. The two remained silent for a few moments. - \"You know very well that I do not like that you fence with those people\" -said the woman seriously. - \"But mama, Commander Rourke will go with us\" -the young man mentioned. - \"And that's the problem ... I do not like that commander of yours, when I saw him for the first time, I could feel that he is a person who only cares about money, and would do anything to get it, I even feel that he would get rid of it. his men \"-said something anguished. \"Mom, do not overdo it, Commander Rourke would never kill people for money.\" - \"Let's hope you're right Alex ... ..but come back, you know I need you ... since ... your father\" - he said sadly as he looked down, the young man approaches his mother and hugs her very fondly. \"Brother?\" Said a weak voice, when the young man, now known as Alex, turns to see a little girl of 6 years, white skin, and has in one of his hands a teddy bear. - \"What are you doing here, I thought you were sleeping?\" - Alex said as he approached the little girl. - \"I'll miss you\" -said the little girl, knowing that her brother was going to leave. Alex, giving a sigh, gets to his height. - \"I also ... oh, I promise I'll get the money for your operation that you need, okay?\" - Alex said with determination. But before anyone else spoke, a clack was ringing outside. - \"They're here for you\" -said her mother having leaned out the window, then Alex grabs her backpack, and walked to the exit. - \"See you,\" he said as he left his house. - \"ALEX!\" - said the little girl before she gave a big hug to her brother, and he corresponds. (-) - (-) The soldier started to get out of his memories, so he could wake up slowly, the first thing he saw was that he was in a cave in the volcano, it was something small, and it had a hole where air leaked inside the cave, also when I try to move, he felt that his back had hurt a little, he still had his backpack, when he sat down a bit, he began to remember what happened, and when he did, something scared, he started to turn around where Lieutenant Sinclair was, and when he saw her, he began to approach, little by little, to her. End of the Chapter. I know very well that It is very short, compared to the first, but I have barely had time these days, but I promise that the next chapter will be longer. See you later. Goodbye.[Chapter 3] Once again welcome to this story, keep enjoying reading it and if you have any comments or questions, you can tell me with confidence. Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap. 3 Review. Alex got up and approached slowly Helga, at a slow pace saw his lieutenant was mouth under a rock something flat, when finally was close enough, Alex tried to grab her torso, but before that remembered that the last time I hold her tight, she complained of pain, so very carefully and delicately put her arm around Helga's abdomen, and began to turn slowly, so that she could be face up. When I finished turning it, Alex saw how Helga was, and what he saw left him very worried; now Helga's breathing was rougher and more forced than before, and her whole body was very ill-treated, her white shirt was dirty now, her face reflected a great pain that she felt. Alex decided to put two of his fingers on Helga's neck to see how his pulse was, when he put them he worried that he almost did not feel them, then more anguished he put his head on Helga's chest, where his heart is, Luck I felt it throb, very little but I felt it. Now after pleading a little, he started thinking about what he should do, when an idea occurred to him suddenly, Alex very carefully grabbed Helga under his armpits, and started dragging her towards the leaking hole so that I had a fresh air, in doing so, he could hear and felt as the lieutenant complained of pain. - \"Forgive me, Lieutenant\" - he thought something regretful for doing this, and although he did not want to drag her, he had no choice, his back was still not fully recovered and he felt that if he carried it, he could throw it away and the least he wanted was to hurt her more. . When I finally arrived, I arrange Helga so that her back could be recharged on the wall, when I put it on. Alex went to where the backpack was, and from her I took out what was two blankets, one put it on the rocky floor and the other I fold it, did not have time to put it on when she saw that Helga almost fell over, quickly achieved catch her before she fell. Then he dragged her back to Helga until he reached the blanket, carefully began to lie down, and lying down, delicately raised his head with one of his hands and with the other put the other blanket folded under the head of Helga, already bent, carefully under his head. When he finished, Alex sighed and leaned a little on the wall. -At least Lieutenant Sinclair will have some fresh air- saying it while trying to be a bit optimistic. But his little tranquility did not last long when he saw in the body of his lieutenant, more specifically his left leg, he was broken, he approaches and if, he checked that his ankle was out of place, now with that new problem, he quickly went to backpack. -There must be something that can help me-he said something desperate, when his search found something very useful. -Ah ... very well-saying happy while pulling some bandages from the backpack, but when I took them out he saw that it was not the only thing that bandages came out of the backpack. A very small glass had fallen on the floor, Alex picked it up. -But what is this ?, It looks like giant glass -he questioned, remembered that he had already seen it, but does not remember very well where. I would have continued to see if it was not for having heard the breathing and coughing agonies of Helga that made him react, he keeps the glass in his pants and again approaches Helga. When he was close enough, he began to prepare a checkup on the entire body of his lieutenant, maybe he could not do more than he wanted, but if he had knowledge of medicine. - \"Thank you dad, for having taught me ... before you left\" - thinking with much gratitude to his father and sadness for remembering him, then he carefully began to do a check on the body of Helga. End of the Chapter So far the chapter arrives. Thank you for continuing with the story and I send a cordial greeting to all the others who are reading. Without saying more, I say goodbye and wish you in this new year, fulfill all your purposes.[Chapter 4] Once again welcome to this story, keep enjoying reading it and if you have any comments or questions, you can tell me with confidence. Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap 4. Questions and the crystal The inhabitants of Atlantis, were amazed by what they saw, that before their home they had scarce food, now they could eat much better, the big buildings were raised and most importantly, the heart of Atlantis was high in the sky. And although hours have already passed, nobody stopped contemplating the city, and especially ... .. - INCREDIBLE EVERYTHING! - said Milo very excited and began to draw in his notebook, a drawing that was in a nearby mural, while he was accompanied by Vynni, Aundrey and Mrs. Packard, the latter taken pictures. \"Easy boy, it's not that impressive,\" Vynni said neutrally. - As it is not impressive, we are talking about paintings that people did thousands of years ago! - Milo exclaimed. -Well ... while they took thousands of years to make a column, I took a few seconds to make a bridge-said while shrugging. -Yes, do not remind me. -Milo, I can ask you a question-said Audrey while I saw it. -Claro Audrey, go ahead-said Milo while he stopped writing in his notebook. - Do you know what happened to Helga? It's not like I care about her, but the last time I saw her, it was when she threw to me and Sweet some bombs to prevent us from releasing Kida. -If it's true, after that we did not see her and when we return to the surface, we'll have to explain to Mr. Whitmore why she does not come with us -Vynni said also entering the conversation. -Well ... to be frank, if I knew what happened to her-said Milo while scratching his neck a little. \"Well?\" Aundrey said interestedly. -Well ... after I collided with one of the balloons that helped the airship to rise ... .I could hear Rourke telling Helga to throw heavy things ... and then listen as Rourke tried to win her . What? - said Aundrey and Vynni surprised, and Mrs. Packard for the first time, was interested in the conversation. -Yes, apparently Rourke wanted to get rid of everything that was heavy ... but then I heard how both fought, and after getting close enough, I saw Rourke grabbing Helga from one of his legs, and then throwing without hesitation, After I saw him, he launched me towards Rourke and the rest of them already know it-finishing his story, Milo sighed. I can not believe how much Rourke would have come with just winning-said Aundrey very annoyed. -Hey ... .Do you think that Helga has survived? - Milo said, somewhat anguished. -Chico, was thrown by several meters in height and if he had not killed the fall, then died with the explosion of lava-Vynni said. -But ... .. Maybe she before the explosion of the lava, could enter an underground cave? Maybe she is still alive-said Milo while trying to be optimistic. -Milo ... -said Aundrey as he put his hand, on one of the shoulders of Milo-we must be optimistic ... ..If Helga have survived a fall of several meters high ... with the blow received from the fall She must have been unconscious and the lava was taken ... ..but if by a miracle she had enough strength to be awake, crawl and reach a cave ... .the wounds must have killed her ... .Milo, I know that your intentions are good, but it is impossible that Helga could survive that. -If you're right-said Milo something sad. -Don't feel bad, she chose her way-said Mrs. Packard, while she was taking pictures again. -Milo is right, Helga chose to steal the heart of Atlantis, he could have done the right thing like us, but he did not, and suffered its consequences -Vynni said as he started walking again. Then we see how everyone started to walk again, although Milo was not as focused as before, since he was thinking about Kida, about what will happen next. Elsewhere…. We see how Alex, carefully he goes down and accommodates the white shirt that Helga had. A few minutes ago, Alex was carefully reviewing Helga's entire body, to discover that not only did she have several broken ribs and her leg, but her back was also bruised and had bruises almost all over her body. And if that were not enough, the lieutenant's pulse was decreasing. Alex, desperately began to search through the backpack to see that it could be useful, and although he found useful things such as a canteen with water, nothing that would be useful for medical things, since the backpack was almost full of gold coins, suppose that the mercenary that belonged that backpack, must have stolen for him. But while looking in the backpack, he began to hear a voice. - Let's go - Alex started to hear someone saying it. Alex confused, turned his gaze to see if Lieutenant Sinclar was the one who spoke to her, but saw that she was still as he left her, but he realized that the voice came from his mind. - You already have the money to stop the operation, the only thing left is to leave here - the voice said again. -I'll leave ... when Lieutenant Sinclair recovers-he said while he was still looking. - Leave it ... we have to go -telling the voice again. -Forget it, I will not leave to your fate. - But look at her ... ... she has almost all her ribs broken and she can barely breathe ... ..and she's practically dead -I sentence with cruelty. Alex just kept thinking for a moment, and then see Helga how he could barely breathe and although I consider leaving, since he has the money and no one would know that I abandoned ... he was not that way. -I will stay and period, because now I have a new mission ... .and is to save my lieutenant-Alex said decisively. - Tsss, you'll see, he said very annoyed. Already when Alex finished checking in the backpack and no longer hear the voice of his mind, again listen as Helga began to have difficulty breathing, Alex grabbed a rag he had and came close enough to be with Helga, then Sit on the floor and put your lap on Helga's head, so that he with the rag with which he had in hand, begin to clean Helga's forehead. But while he was doing it, he saw that from his pocket of his pants began to shine, the stranger checked his pocket to then take out the small crystal, which was the source of light, the wonder of why it was illuminated, he discovered that the crystal It illuminated more when it was closer to Helga's forehead, Alex if he knew why, put the crystal gently on Helga's forehead, on the tip of her nose. For after I put it on, the crystal will light up more, until finally I stop shining. - \"But what happened?\" - began to question. But when I remove the crystal from the tip of Helga's nose, but then saw Helga's face, which was in agony, began to relax, her harsh and forced breathing began to regulate. Alex via all this surprised, to later with one of his hands verify his pulse and discovered that it was better. \"I can not believe it,\" he said, amazed to see the glass again and again carefully. When I save it, I saw how Helga's face was calm, and then leaving the cloth on its side and with her hand to accommodate Helga's hair. -Don't worry Lieutenant ... I will not abandon her, I'll take care of her until she recovers and we can leave ... this will be my mission. End of the Chapter So far the chapter arrives.

Without more to say, I say goodbye and see you.[Chapter 5] Once again welcome to this story, keep enjoying reading it and if you have any comments or questions, you can tell me with confidence. Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap 5. The awakening Alex grabbed the glass, which began to shine, then put the glass on the back bare Helga, this brightness and then stop doing it, when Alex removed the glass, a cut that Helga had in the back, they began to heal At the end of it Alex drops Helga's shirt, so that it will cover it again. And carefully Alex puts one of his arms around Helga's thorax, and then begin to turn it so that it is face up. It has been three days since Alex has stayed with Helga, Alex in his spare time began to remove the rocks that had blocked the exit, but fatigue and hunger and was taking its toll, although luckily there was some food in the backpack , he wanted to keep most of it for his lieutenant when he woke up. Although that caused the voice of his mind again, it bothered him to keep the food for her. During all this time, Helga has not moved apart from some jolt of pain, but the best thing of all is that she was getting better little by little, her breathing was more stable and her pulse stronger, and though. Alex wanted to heal the fractures Helga had, discovered that the glass only healed the external wounds and relieved the pain, but it did not heal the internal parts, such as the ribs. For the moment, he just took care that the broken parts did not move. When Alex placed her face up on Helga, she made a small moan of pain when her back touched the ground. And when he was already on his back, Alex saw how his lieutenant moved his head a little and Helga started blinking a bit. Alex was speechless with what he saw, the lieutenant was starting to wake up, he was not expected to wake up so soon, much less with his injuries that he has, for the moment Alex had to wait until she could open her eyes ... ... .. (0) (0) (0) ... I was totally full of anger, and I enjoyed the blows I gave to Rourke, but it does not end there. -You promised me a percentage! - I said annoyed and I turn on my own axis to kick him with much more strength, and when I'm about to connect, he grabs my leg, and I see how he gets up with my leg grasped. -The next time, ask for it in writing! -he began to tell me to later feel like he was bending my leg, I hear how my bone breaks, but before I could scream or feel the pain, I feel like he throws me out of the airship, I try to extend my hands to try to grab the railing again, but he throws me far away so I can not go back. -ROURKE! -I scream totally full of anger and I feel like fear began to emerge inside me, my braided hair untied and start spinning uncontrollably in the air. -It's nothing personal! -I hear how he shouts at me mockingly, I think it increases my anger, I feel like I keep falling and before I could realize, I see the solid rock of the volcano ... (0) (0) (0) Helga gave a little moan before opening her eyes a little, but when she opened them, she immediately closed them, because she felt an unbearable pain in her body, but much more in her chest, and the agony came in her, she tried to scream for the excruciating pain he felt and felt, but he simply opened his mouth but made no noise, could barely breathe, and when he breathed his chest exploded with pain. Leaving Shock that he had when seeing how his lieutenant had awakened, Alex approached enough to be at his side to see how she began to feel his whole body, he takes the glass back and puts it in the chest part of Helga , to relieve your pain. POV De Helga (seconds before) I gave a small moan of pain, I begin to feel a terrible pain in my whole body light and when I open my eyes a bit ... .. I feel a terrible and unbearable pain in my body, I immediately close them, I feel like everything screams at me , I try to open my mouth to scream in pain for everything I felt, and especially as I feel my chest is about to burst with pain, but I can not even complain ... .I do not have the strength for that, I'm just breathing is impossible for me to breathe normally. I do not know what happens or where I am, my mind is very blurred what happened after I fainted, and I continued with my suffering, when suddenly I feel like inexplicably, my chest began to ease, and the pain began to calm down. What allows me to open my eyes a little, my view is too blurry, the only thing I can see is something black on the ceiling and I feel like someone sees me, I move my head a little bit, although doing so I made a moan of pain, what I see when I turn my head, is to distinguish a silhouette, I try to clear my eyes ... and what I see is ... Rourke seeing me with a lot of mockery. -What a pathetic time you ... ... Lieutenant Sinclair-I listen as he tells me, I leave my surprise to see him, so that my interior grows an intense hatred when remembering what he did to me. -Rourke ... -she whispered his name with a lot of fury, I tried to shout at him but my pain in my chest is still there, I see how he bends down enough to be his face next to mine. -What did you say? -he told me with his mocking smile. -I said ... .. ... ROURKE WILL ASSASSIN! -I shout with a lot of fury, I do not care that I hardly felt my body, that my chest is exploding with pain, I make him regret what caused me.

Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap 6. Confusions Back at Atlantis, Milo and the others, all of them were still enjoying themselves in the Atlantida ranch, maybe they must have returned to the surface two days ago, but no one was in a hurry to leave and here they were treated like heroes, reason they decided to stay a few more days. In the royal palace, everyone was going to enjoy a real banquet that the Atlanteans were preparing for them, and they discovered that the strange meals here were much better than Cookie's. And everyone was about to eat, if it was not for ... -Do you hear someone has seen Milo, it's been a long time? -asked Sweet something worried about him. -I last time I saw him, he was very distracted -said Mole while he was already eating some kind of creatures with several eyes. \"Hey, I told you to eat your head, there are the nutrients,\" Sweet told Mole. \"Excuse me, I'll go look for him,\" Kida said as he got up from the table, to go find Milo. Meanwhile, Milo was sitting on one of the steps he led inside and was totally immersed in his thoughts. One of the things she thought was that she was beginning to decide to stay here on Atlantis, it was her dream and her grandfather's dream to find her after all. \"I wish you were here, grandfather,\" thought Milo, thinking how fascinated his grandfather was when he saw Atlantis with his own eyes. But there was something much more important than he wanted to stay, and that was Kida's reason, he had to admit, he was totally in love with her, even more than Atlantis herself. And another thing that I could not stop thinking ... .it was in Helga, since I had the conversation with Audrey, Vynni and Packard a few days ago, I kept thinking about her. Maybe yes, Helga was on Rouurke's side, and she wanted to sell the crystal to the highest bidder but she kept thinking that she had a horrible and painful death. During this time, he wanted to believe that somehow Helga could have survived, after all he was no one cruel to wish him death, despite his actions, but then he thought that even if the volcano did not kill her, that fall had that have caused some internal bleeding. Without medical attention, for which she doubted that anyone had the necessary equipment, she would have died even if the volcano had not erupted. Then he learned that Kida sent a group of explorers to see how the volcano was left, and the answer was obvious: the crater was a disaster, ashes everywhere, rocks melted by lava and no trace of any survivor or body. He had to accept the harsh truth: Helga and the other mercenaries, they were all dead and their bodies must have melted by the lava. -At least ... I said before the eruption, picked up his body-Milo thought something sad. -Oh, here's Milo, I was looking for you- Kida said, she found Milo sitting on the steps -we're waiting for you to eat ... .well some of your friends have already started. -Oh ... ..if Kida, come on- said Milo as happy as possible to be with Kida. Elsewhere….. Alex to see how the glass went off, again stored in his pants, to stop again and see how Helga's face began to relax, then he saw how his lieutenant began to open his eyes slowly, he saw as she I took deep breaths, but before I could do something or say POV. of Alex I still can not believe that Lieutenant Sinclair is waking up, I thought that with the fractures that she had, she would be unconscious for at least a week or two, the truth is to be admired, I notice how the Lieutenant began to open her eyelids a little, and noticed how her eyes open slowly but only open slightly and I notice how her eyes were glassy and unfocused, then I notice how she moves her head slightly sideways where I was, I hear how she made a moan of pain when doing it, and I notice that she He was watching me. I do not know what to say, and the only thing I can think of is ... -It's fine ... Lieutenant Sinclair? -I said something worried, but in my mind I hit myself, which asks more foolish, although I mean that she had almost all broken bones, has respiratory complications and that If there had not been the crystal that I found, I hated to admit, she would already be dead. -Rourke ... ..- I hear how she spoke to me, I think I heard that she said the name of the Commander, but the truth is I'm not sure, she approached me enough so that my face could be next to his to hear her better and that she does not force herself. -Did you tell me something? -she asked softly to her -I said ... .THE ASESINARE ROURKE! ... POV. GENERAL. Having said that Helga in his blind fury and hatred tried to hit Alex with his left hand, he manages to dodge it in time, and seeing his lieutenant trying to get up, in the subject of his shoulders trying not to hurt her. But Helga did not stop and when she saw an opening in her defense, with the only strength she had, she with her right leg kicked Alex in her leg. Alex felt the kick, felt a great pain, although the kick did not have much strength, anyway if it hurt. When he saw how she was very defensive, he moved away, to prevent her from scoring again and to try to make her feel more secure and calm down. But when he walked a few meters away from her, Helga surprisingly managed to get up hard, Alex saw this Shokeado then seeing as Helga was about to launch, Helga's broken leg bent, causing her to growl in pain , but quickly it gave a blow to Alex in its face, but this one did not have anything of force, and with a gasp of fatigue, its body did not react and it was dropped in the chest of Alex, without breath or force. Alex saw how his lieutenant had no strength, and now she was leaning on his chest, saw how she tried to breathe and her face reflected pain, it was obvious that she suffered a lot ... - \" What a shame.\" Alex heard the voice inside his head, the same voice that has been torturing him for days. - \"Even though we saved her, you took care of her and that you keep the food when she woke up ... ... and how she pays you, hitting you and trying to kill you\". -It's not that ... ..only Lieutenant Sinclir must be confused-Alex said to her mind while arranging it so that she could be lying down. - \"Yes, of course ... ..what you say, at least you would have thrown it on the floor, so that it could learn\" -the voice was saying again. -You want to leave me alone- Alex said annoyed as he took out the glass to put it back in Helga's chest. - \"... Very well, that we do not live ... I do not care ...\" the voice said before Alex heard nothing. Alex sighed and when I just shined the glass, Helga without believing that as she felt as she began to recover, she gave harsh, complicated and deep breaths, opened her eyes again.

Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap 7. Knowing the savior. I hate to admit it ... I'm finished. Recently I woke up and had a small confrontation against Rourke, but I'm totally broken my body, and I have a hard time breathing, when I saw that he claimed to recover from the kick I gave him in the leg, I with my great strength of Will, I managed to get my body to react, I got up and leaned against the ... but I had forgotten my fractured leg, I hear my bone bend, what I growled in pain, but I quickly hit it, but as soon as I hit, I felt As a great fatigue and agony took hold of me, and I could not control myself and I started to fall face, when I thought I was going to touch the ground, I feel like my head touches and is recharged in his chest. I try to defend myself ... .but I can not ... ... again I open my eyes, but the agony prevented me ... ... now I have to accept that he will do anything to me ... .. maybe I hit the floor , I kicked, I broke my bones, I hit my chest to suffer more ... The only thing I will not do is beg for mercy ... That is for the cowards, and I am not ... .but I can not help thinking that there is something strange, maybe I can not see, but if I listen, and the only thing I hear is the heartbeat ... I thought that nothing would be heard, as it would be for a person without compassion or mercy as it is Rourke ... But these, are like a quiet person, compassionate and safe ... as if he wanted to protect me ... ..ja, yes of course. T hen I feel like I start to move and I feel something warm all over my body, then I feel like something recharges in my chest, and then again inexplicably my pain began to diminish, I gave some rough, complicated and deep breaths and again , I started opening my eyes ... POV. GENERAL. Alex, saving the glass again, saw how his lieutenant gave rough, complicated and deep breaths, and then reassured himself, and before he knew it, Alex saw that Helga opened his eyes, and she was looking at him fixedly. Alex saw the blue eyes of his lieutenant who was staring at him, and making him feel unsure of what to do now. When Helga saw Alex, she did not know what to think, for a moment she thought that who she was seeing was Rourke, but when at last her vision cleared up, what she saw was a boy, she saw that he had the same clothing as the mercenaries that they were willing to follow her as Rourke to be millionaires, only that the difference is that the boy did not have his gas mask, like the others. Neither Alex nor Helga did not know what to say, and as Helga saw that the boy was not going to speak, he decided to do it first. -Who are you? ... and where am I? - Helga asked in a whisper, her voice was rough and hoarse from the pain she still felt, her chest hurt every time she breathed. -Yo ... .emm, I'm just a merce ...-Alex started to answer him, but when he realized he was going to describe himself as \"mercenary\", he hates that word, because he was not that way- ... sorry, a soldier who is also part of the expedition, and we are both trapped in a volcano cave. Helga, tried to sit down, but watched as the boy put his hand gently on her shoulder, preventing her from getting up. -I do not advise that I do, is seriously injured-Alex told Helga worried, she tried to reproach him but when he tried to sit down, moved a little his chest, causing a huge pain to run through his body, without more than she said he did. -What happened ... ... and how did we get here? -Helga asked Alex, she tried to control her voice so that it was no longer harsh and hoarse, she hated that she looked weak. -Well ... ..when the Atlanteans began to send rays of their machines, I managed to survive a truck explosion, my companions did not survive ... after I saw how the Gyro-Evac was bursting into flames, I started running to be in a safe place, then in the middle of my path, I found her, I noticed that you were badly hurt, so I picked her up and took her with me to help her, because when the Gyro-Evac hit the surface, it caused the volcano It will erupt. I finish explaining Alex to Helga. Helga began to think about the boy's explanation, it was obvious that he was also a mercenary, and now he remembered vaguely, that before he fainted from his wounds, he heard steps not far from her, those steps must have been the boy who was watching. But before he could answer the boy, she saw him get down a little to start untying his boots. -What are you doing? -asked Helga to see how the boy began to untie his boots. -Need to take off his boots to adjust more bandages on his ankle ... .. I'll be frank, this will hurt-Alex said as he finished undoing the shoelaces of Helga's boots, and he began to pull. Helga's back arched as Alex tried to free his boots. A few painful seconds later, Helga breathed with difficulty to feel how her back was pulled and how her fractured leg was a little accommodated. \"Ready, try not to move your ankle,\" Alex told his lieutenant, then started thinking about something he had in mind long ago. -By the way ... How do I end this way?, What happened to him? - Alex asked Helga, while she tried to breathe - ... I do not want to talk about that-Helga said to the boy, I hated to remember the pain he felt when hitting the volcano floor-better tell me ... someone else survived-she wanted to know if Rourke was dead. -I will be sinceró ... .no, nobody else could escape the eruption of the volcano, I hopefully managed to charge it and enter a cave where the lava did not arrive, although now we are trapped-Alex began to explain. Helga could not help but smile a little with what I hear. - Oh Rourke, I hope she's resting in pieces ... Even if I wanted to kill you personally, I'll have to be satisfied -he began to think while squeezing his right fist, since she wanted to see Rourke die. -Oh I see, you say we're stuck right? -I asked the boy. -Yes ... ..but do not worry, I'll remove the rocks, you have to rest, you're seriously injured -said Alex when he noticed that his lieutenant wanted to get out of here quickly. Helga tried to tell her not to worry about her, since she wanted to show that she did not need to rest, but her body did not even react to get up, so I decided to surrender and stay in bed. \"How bad am I?\" He began to ask the boy. \"He has almost all the broken ribs, the odd wound on his body and his broken ankle, he has to rest in bed ... .. or blankets in this case,\" Alex told his lieutenant. Helga sighed in annoyance. \"How long will it take to heal me completely?\" Asked Helga. -As one, five or six weeks approximately -said Alex. Helga gave a sigh of frustration and anger at those words, since lying down was not something she liked, and again cursed Rourke for the condition she was in, but at least she was still breathing in comparison of him, and he knew perfectly well that he would have died in one or two ways; with the explosion of the lava of the volcano, his body would have been melted or with a slow and painful death from his internal wounds, in short he would have died without the help of the boy. \"What's your name boy?\" Helga asked, she had to admit, she wanted to know who saved her. \"Alex, Lieutenant Sinclair,\" he said, introducing himself formally. Helga realized that even though Alex no longer had to address himself in that way, he still did. -Helga ... Just call me Helga, now if it does not bother you ... ..I want to rest a bit, \"she said to Alex, before she turned her head on the opposite side, which again moaned in pain and started to closing his eyes to rest a little and the product of fatigue, and knowing that he would be in this state for several days, he needed a hobby, and what came to his head was ... -Hello Commander, it's nothing personal-in Helga's mind, she imagined that she was standing in front of Rourke and she was holding a gun, and then shooting Rourke straight in the face. End of the Chapter So far the chapter arrives. Thank you for continuing with the story and I send a cordial greeting to; Jarjaxle, FictionWriter91, matthew, Saphira all the others who are reading it. Without more to say, I say goodbye and see you.[Chapter 8] Once again welcome to this story, keep enjoying reading it and if you have any comments or questions, you can tell me with confidence. Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap 8. Revelation . We can appreciate in a cave of a volcano, which a few days ago erupted, Helga was sleeping a bit, when suddenly, some small rocks fell off the others that were blocking the exit, the noise was very little, but enough for Helga to wake up and open her eyes suddenly, which caused immense pain to travel throughout her body, especially her abdomen and chest, Helga moaned to feel the pain again, and quickly closed her eyes. Inside, he still suffered from breathing, it hurt every time his chest moved. But determined not to show weakness, she slowly began to open her eyes. As his vision cleared, he saw how the boy who had saved his life, was leaning against a rocky wall, and that he was sleeping, next to him there were some rocks around him, he must have assumed that they are rocks that he removed from the exit. Leaving that aside, Helga turned her head a little so that she could see the light of nightfall seeping into the small hole. Maybe she needed to sleep a little longer, but she could not forget her pain, although she tried to forget it. Since sleeping was something he desperately needed and that demanded his body. Apart from needing to rest and rest for all her injuries and fractures, she had barely slept during the entire trip, from the submarine to Atlantis. She remembers that at the beginning, when they were just going to start the trip, since Rourke did not want to review anything, since he told her, that he had to find the best bidder to sell the heart of Atlantis, when they had it in his hands, so she, as the second in command of the expedition, had to see to it that everything was ready and that they had not forgotten anything, like; medical equipment, communication, necessary weapons, men who were present, everything that was mechanical, was in good working order, although there were people who took care of it and assured that it was completely fine, for it was better that she inspected them herself and of course food necessary for the big trip, since he knew that Cookie did not carry essential things for a good diet and even remembered that she and he had an argument and he assured her that the four basic groups was, \"lard, pork, whiskey and beans. \" She thought that she could finally rest on the trip, but the attack of the Leviatan arose and then she as a lieutenant, the only officer besides Rourke who had survived the attack in the submarine, needed to watch that everything was in order, make sure the provisions will be used wisely, keep things organized, establish travel plans for the following days, among other things. While Rourke, he never bothered about those details, causing her to let her do everything alone, making the excuse that he was more of a \"military\" planner, and that he did not have time. She also remembered that during the trip, a truck had stopped working and she was one of the few people who decided or rather received the order from Rourke, to push the truck uphill until it reached a flat area so that Audrey could repair it, when they did arrive at a large cave where there was a large natural lamp of green color that shone brightly and later there was a large bridge, she was grateful when Rourke gave the order to rest, and she immediately went to a corner and she set up her little camp to power inside him, rub her arms and legs from the pain and exhaustion they felt, and also so that no one would see that she was tired, when she finished doing so, she could finally take a rest. - \"Was it too much to ask for a night of rest?\" - thought with irony and annoyance Helga, since he remembered that he woke up in the middle of the night, since Milo shouted fire at the top of his lungs, he really wanted to strangle him, but when he caught the smell of burning, she woke up and saw through her camp as there was a big fire near her, so she quickly got up and gave the order to put out the flames. Now that she thought it over, she did all the work, from the beginning of the expedition to the arrival of Atlantis ... ..while Rourke, she took all the credit ... ..THE CREDIT. \"Damn you, Rourke, how stupid I was,\" Helga murmured furiously, as she closed her right hand tightly, and the more she felt angry with herself, since she was just discovering that all the time she was used by him, she was totally blind when he He told him that he would give him part of the percentage of the money they were going to get when they sold the heart of Atlantis. For the moment he decided to stop thinking about that, and turned his head to see the boy, although by the movement, moaned a little pain to feel again his bones of the ribs move a little. Helga saw how the boy was still asleep, and although I try to talk to him, but his voice was barely audible, which caused him to get upset, and when Helga tried to take a deep breath, in order to have as much oxygen as possible, but her chest did not allow it, the sharpness caused her to have a coughing fit, causing Alex to wake up and when she realized how Helga had her attack, she got up and approached her and gently lifted her head, raising her so that she could breathe more easily. \"Briefly, briefly make the attacks stop,\" he advised, moving and arranging the blanket under his head, which served as a pillow, to replace his hand. Helga did not pay attention to what she was saying, since she still had her coughing attack, and although it did not seem like it, she really did hurt even coughing, but seeing Alex's eyes were kind and conveyed safety when she He said, so he supposed it could not be bad, so he allowed it to be accommodated. When Helga's coughing attack stopped, Alex clung to the backpack to get a small metal can and a spoon, when he had them he returned with Helga with things, and then Helga saw how Alex wanted to grab her. -What are you doing? -asked confused. -I'm going to make him sit down, so he can eat-Alex answered as he put aside the small metal can and spoon that he grabbed from the knapsack, then Alex used both hands to slide under Helga's shoulders, lifting it gently enough as if to be able to get her back from her to recharge the rock wall. Then, Alex opened the can, revealing a soup, although it was more broth, then Alex grabbed the spoon to feed Helga, since it was very difficult to grab things. Helga, unable to feed herself, she felt angry and annoyed, since the way Alex fed her, she felt like a baby, but for the moment she left those feelings, since she felt grateful for at least eating a little good and especially, although I did not want to admit it, with the boy. Alex continued to feed Helga in silence, and after Helga finished eating, without saying anything, she went back to bed with Alex's help, and shortly after, she fell asleep and went back to sleep. Alex to see how his Helga fell asleep, took the glass back in his pants, and placed it back on Helga's chest, to relieve her pain, when it stopped glowing, Helga's breathing became more stable. - \"I did not even thank you\" -Alex again heard in his mind, the voice that always bothered him. - \"Do you even eat and she does not even thank you for that or tell me, did she thank you for saving her?\" - asked his subconscious angrily. \"You want to shut up ... I'm not in the mood to argue with you,\" Alex said as he sat where he was, thankfully, I do not hear that voice anymore. Alex sighed and although he wanted to keep removing the rocks again so he could get out, he felt weak, and felt a little more when he used the glass again. \"It must be because of hunger,\" Alex thought, as he closed his eyes again to rest. But what he ignores and does not know is that he felt weak not only because of hunger, but because of something else. End of the Chapter So far the chapter arrives. Thank you for continuing with the story and I send a cordial greeting to; FictionWriter91, matthew, all the others who are reading it. Without more to say, I say goodbye and see you.[Chapter 9] Once again welcome to this story, keep enjoying reading it and if you have any comments or questions, you can tell me with confidence. Atlantis, it's not my property. Chap. 9. Emergence of doubts It was a new night for the new Atlantis, and all its inhabitants were inside their own homes. Although it is very strange that, since normally everyone would be enjoying their new city or they would be in their typical feasts for their great harvest that they have had these days, but today it is an exception since it was suddenly released an indescribable cold that scared away all the inhabitants of Atlantis, since they were not so accustomed to this climate. Although there was no problem, since everyone in their homes set a bonfire to keep them warm and many were near the fire while they ate a little and even the children began to fall asleep near the pleasant heat, and in the temple was no exception, some guards lit some torches outside to be able to chase away the cold, and while in the guest room, the guests, feeling a little cold, also lit a little fire inside their rooms, and the fire plus the great comfort that they had, not to mention the great feast they had, did not last long to make them sleepy, but in the infirmary, where the temple patients were treated, and Milo asked to speak with Sweet in private, since he wanted his opinion on something personal that he had saved, and he accepted it, but only if they went to the infirmary to talk. When Milo finished explaining his problems, he thought a little before talking. \"So ... Are you sure you want to stay here in the city of Atlantis and not come back to the surface?\" Sweet asked Milo. -I've thought about it a lot and if ... .. I'm going to stay, Kira will need someone to teach the other Atlantic people about her origins-answered Milo for sure. -I'm sure that's it, or is it more for Kida? -Sayed Sweet something flirtatious, and Milo blushed a little- And she who told you ?. -The truth is we have not talked much, since she has been reading some scrolls lately that her dad left to her-said Milo with some sadness. \"Oh, and what do they speak of those scrolls?\" Sweet asked curiously. -From what little she has told me, I only know that he reveals everything about the Heart of Atlantis and other things of the past, so that his daughter does not make the same mistakes he made. -I think it's a good idea-says Sweet while she starts looking for something in the infirmary. -Yes, do you hear what are you looking for? -Asked Milo while via Sweet sought. \"This was what I wanted,\" said Sweet, as he carried in his hands a kind of small square vase. \"And why?\" Milo asked confused. In response, Sweet removed the lid of the vase, to relieve its contents. \"Are Crystals?\" Said Milo surprised, that indeed, there were Atlantic crystals, there were a total of 20. -Yes, when I went by here to see how the healers treated the wounded of the battle to recover the Heart of Atlantis, surprisingly most of them had recovered from all their wounds and I saw that it was thanks to the Crystals -said Sweet happy . Milo was not surprised by the relief, since he already experimented and saw what the Crystals could do, the great healing power they had. -Asique it occurred to me to take them to the surface to be able to use that great healing power to all the seriously injured that there in the hospitals, of course, if Kida allows me to take them. Milo did not think it was a good idea to bring the Crystals to the surface, because although he knew perfectly that Sweet would never use them for selfish purposes or sell them to the highest bidder, it could arouse the greed of many people, but before he could express his opinion ... .. -I'm sorry Sweet, I can not let you take them-said a voice to the back of Sweet and Milo, and they turned to see Kida. \"Kida, how long have you been?\" Asked a nervous Milo, since he hoped she had not heard the first conversation he had with Sweet. \"Just get there, but listen to the idea of Sweet,\" Kida said as he walked to be with them both, although Milo sighed in relief. \"And why not Kida? Is there a problem with the crystals?\" Sweet asked as she left the vase in its place. -It is dangerous… -Yes, Kida is right, Sweet, it is dangerous for people to know the great healing power that crystals have, many could wish for their power, a clear example is Rourke -said Milo interrupting Kida, so she knows she has her support . -Well aside from its people, it is dangerous for those who are going to use it -said Kida, to the surprise of Milo and Sweet. \"Dangerous, what do you mean Kida?\" Milo asked confused. - You see, when I was reading the scrolls that my dad left me before ... ... it died - Kida said sadly - he tells me about the Heart of Atlantis that always has to remain hidden, where it is, and something very important ... because he forbade the use of the excessive healing power of crystals. When I mention it, I leave the two men surprised again, but before they can ask, Kida continues with his story. -The Crystal has a great healing power, of that there is no doubt, but its use has a high price ... He who uses the Crystal, has to give his own energy to the crystal so that he can give it to the wounded, while the more serious the wound, the more energy it has to give. When Milo and Sweet heard the story of Kida, they understood that although the Crystals heals the wounded, the one who uses them will give their own energy to heal, which would cause even the one with the Crystal to weaken, in short, they are a weapon double-edged by saying so. And Milo understood why the King did not allow him to use the Crystal to heal him, even if he had done so, he would have been totally exhausted to give the King more time to live, but it would only slow his inevitable death a little. \"And you can only access them to the healing power of the Crystals, right?\" Sweet asked Kida. -I do not know, why the question ?. -Well, a few hours ago, Mole cut his palm a little bit when digging through the terrace behind the temple, and the treatment to use the healing power to recover, for more than treatment, could not accede to power-said Sweet while he remembered how funny it was to see how Mole was desperate to not react the glass. -The truth I do not know very well, but I think it's because to access the Crystals, the one who has it in his hand, has to have a pure heart and feeling in wanting to help the wounded -said Kida while remembering that she had those feelings when he met Milo for the first time and that he was hurt from his chest. -Ok, then I will not take them ... .. I think it's time to go back to bed, rest guys, \"said Sweet as she said goodbye to Milo and Kida and left the infirmary. Milo and Kida were left alone without knowing what to say. -Well, see you tomorrow Kida-Milo said nervously, but before he knew it, Kida kissed him on his cheek. \"Rest Milo,\" Kida said before he left, leaving Milo surprised and a big smile on his face. (0) (0) (0) It was nighttime in the city of Washington, and all its citizens were already resting from their Jordanians of the day, well almost since a military car was driving to some very neglected buildings, but the truck stopped at a specific one, and A young man came out carrying a bag on his shoulders, getting out of the car. - \"See you tomorrow Alex\" -the driver said the name of the boy and Alex just raised his hand something tired farewell, when the bass completely, the driver continued with his march. Alex was walking slowly to his building, and when I entered it, he climbed the stairs to the fourth floor where the apartment was located where he and his family live. When I enter the apartment, I try to make as little noise as possible, and while walking, stopped to see a specific place with sadness. The reason, he was seeing his mother sleeping uncomfortably in the only armchair they had, and his torn blanket fell off the chair. Alex to see that, I raise the blanket and put it to his mother, and gave him a small kiss on the forehead, but often told him that he slept in the armchair and she in his bed, his mother did not allow or I wanted to, and I would have continued with my thoughts, if it was not that I hear a voice. - \"Alex\" -the mentioned one heard his name and when he turned to see, he only felt like his little sister was hugging him from his legs. - \"Hey, what are you doing up at this time?\" - Alex asked in a whisper so as not to wake up his mother. - \"I can not sleep, not knowing you're not by my side\" -said the child tenderly, causing Alex to smile. - \"I see, hey, would you sleep if I stay by your side and sing the song you want?\" - Alex said, and a few seconds later the little girl saw him with great emotion and suddenly nodded - \"Very Well, let's go. \" Alex taking the hand of his little sister, both went to the room of the little girl, and the aforementioned she lay down on her bed and hugged her stuffed animal, while Alex sheltered her. - \"We're here, now, what song do you want me to sing?\" - Alex asked as he sat on the bed. - \"The one that papa created and sang to us as a cradle\" -said with excitement the little one. Alex when listening to the request, he began to doubt whether to sing it, the song was not bad on the contrary, but he did not want to hurt his mother in some way to remember his father if he could hear it, but seeing the illusion face of his little sister , could not refuse. \"Okay, but I do not sing the same as he did,\" Alex said jokingly, and his sister gave a small laugh. Alex began to prepare to sing and already feeling ready, he began to sing; Hold on just a little while longer Hold on just a little while longer Hold on just a little while longer Everything will be alright Everything will be alright Fight on just a little while longer Fight on just a little while longer Pray on just a little while longer As he sang, the little girl gave a yawn of sleep. Everything will be alright Everything will be alright We will sing on just a little while longer We will sing on just a little while longer Sing on just a little while longer Sing on just a little while longer Everything will be alright Everything will be alright When Alex finished singing, he saw how she had already fallen asleep, so he got up to go to his room, but when he was about to close his little sister's room, he saw her for the last time. - \"I promise you that I will do everything possible to improve our lives, because you were the most important person in my life, I love you\" -said Alex before closing the door. (0) (0) (0) Alex woke up suddenly, and saw that he fell asleep on the rocks, which caused great discomfort in the back. It was almost complete in the dark, and could only be distinguished because a little light filtered through the hole where there was oxygen, when his eyes cleared up more, he saw how Helga was sleeping but he saw that there were two things that he did not like at all ; one was that she unconsciously, with both hands was holding her right side of her stomach and her face was reflecting pain and the second was that she was involuntarily shaking. Alex got up and walked slowly to her, and carefully grabbed gently and removed Helga's hands from his body, already free, he took something off his shirt to see what was on his side, and could see that he had a cut, not so serious, on his side. So already knowing what to do, I take out the glass I had kept and when this shine, I place it gently in the cut, making the wound heal, causing Helga to show no pain, but when the glass stopped glowing, Alex gave a tired gasp. -You must be ... because of the hunger-mentally told by the fatigue he felt at the time, but left his thoughts when the hole felt a tremendous cold air, and could know why she was shaking. Alex knew he could not move Helga because he did not want to wake her up and why she needed all the oxygen possible. Asiqué making a decision, grabbed a rock something medium and put it and poked in the hole, it was not so cold, but then he sat and reloaded again on the rocks and carefully with his hands lifted the head of Helga and put it on her chest and the blanket that she had before to recharge her head, very difficult to put it to her so that she stayed warm. - \"What are you doing!, Now you serve him as a recharge and give him a blanket so that she stays warm and you do not! ARE YOU CRAZY ?!\" - scream the sub conscious of Alex very upset. -I do it to protect her, and you when you stop bothering me? -Asked Alex to his own mind-Great, I'm going crazy-said annoyed. - \"Oh no, you have not gone crazy or rather said, we have not gone crazy, since I am part of your being and also, I am the only one you can talk to and not the dying\" -said with mockery and cruelty the state of Helga. \"Do not say that to Helga like that,\" Alex said angrily. - \"Helga? ... do not tell me you're getting attached to her\" -said with mockery, and seeing Alex silently, was enough response- \"There, you do not realize that for her, we We are just one of the hundreds mercenaries that she was at hand ... Do you think that she would take care of you in the same way that you do with her? ... ... Do you really think it is worth risking to save a person you met recently to save our own sister? - Said the subconscious to again leave Alex alone. Alex did not know what to answer the last question, and with his doubts in his head, he began to sleep. But Alex so submerged in his thoughts, that he did not listen as Helga to feel and hear the warm heartbeat of Alex, his face reflected a great tranquility, murmur a name. \"Chris,\" he said, and finally a small smile appeared on his face.

(Several cries of joy and excitement are heard) Yes, I know, I am also excited and you my readers decided that I will update this story first, before the others, and thanks for those who voted for us to continue with this story. Well, I do not take your time, and finally, let's continue ... ... ... Oh, and before I forget, in this chapter there will be a special appearance of a great character, very special and known by all, to see if they guess who he is, but those who do not know who he is, at the end of the chapter I will tell you who he is (although I doubt very much that they do not recognize him). Now, let's start. Chap. 10. How everything started In a military base, we can witness how all the military began with their hard routines; some were in the shooting range camp, others were running through the running field, others marching, others in the dining room and others in the gym. But we will concentrate on the gym, where the soldiers are doing some weights, other lizards, others were practicing hand-to-hand combat, but yes, some did not devote their concentration to what they were doing and only look more at a certain corner, since that in that corner is a 17-year-old girl, short blond hair, blue eyes, she was wearing a black tank top and green pants, she was hitting a heavy boxing bag. The girl giving a powerful kick to the sack, it flew back by the energy of the blow, if it had been a person who had received the blow, it would be very painful, which caused the smile of satisfaction of the girl. Decided that it was over for the moment, the girl wiped a little with her forearm the sweat that ran on her forehead and began to store her things in a suitcase to be able to go. But before she could walk to the exit, a group of 3 men in military clothes, a few years older than her, blocked her way. ¨You have great strength¨, said the soldier who was in the middle and took a few steps to face her. \"Get lost,\" the girl said coldly and rudely. ¨Gua !, girl with character, I like that, and if you want me to leave you, just tell me your name¨, the soldier said in a funny way. The girl saw him annoyed, but giving a sigh of irritation, decided to do it. ¨Helga, now leave me alone¨, Helga said curtly and starting to walk, to the exit, but before again the leader of the group interposed in between. ¨Not until you tell me, who taught you to hit that magnitude?¨. \"My father, something else?\" Helga said irritably. ¨Yes, what if you and I are going to a private practice of our best movements?¨, said the leader with a smile and looked sideways at Helga's body, while his two companions were behind Helga,¨ I advise you not to do anything foolish¨. Helga, already knowing his intentions, let out a sigh of irritation, since this was beginning to be habit and annoying, since it began when his body began to \"develop\", and according to what his mother told him, his body He developed too well, even a little more than he should. So, releasing his backpack, he saw the leader of the group again. ¨I advise you not to do anything stupid, imbecile¨. Upon hearing those words, the leader did not hide his fury and threw a direct blow at the girl, to give him a lesson, without knowing who would receive a serious lesson on ... (0) (0) (0) ¨Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!¨. They heard the screams of all the soldiers in the gym to see the show, and that everyone who was in the building, came to see the battle. In the midst of all the spectators, Helga was standing guard watching the leader of the group that bothered her and on the floor were her companions writhing in pain and with their faces bleeding and unconscious. ¨What do you expect, do I hurt you?¨, Helga asked sarcastically, making the leader see her with fury, since he had a black eye for a blow caused by the girl. \"Stupid, you'll see!\", He yelled furiously as he launched a direct blow to her nose, but she grabbed his arm and gave him a powerful kick in the face, which caused her to writhe in pain at the impact. ¨Get up, I still do not finish with you¨, Helga said coldly, which caused the leader to be scared and as he could, he ran towards the crowd hiding among them, and then leaving the gym. ¨Damn coward¨, he said angrily and between teeth Helga, when they saw that everything was over, the crowd moved away from the place to leave also the gym and avoid any punishment given by any superior to them for witnessing a fight and stop it, and others helped the other two unconscious soldiers, making Helga completely alone in the building, when she was about to grab her things ... ¨You are an incredible fighter, to be a girl¨, Helga heard as a man spoke to her in the shadows, when she approached the shadows you see that he was a man between 35 and 40 years of age, had a green commander's uniform and I saw Helga with a smile. Helga was annoyed to think that another fight was coming, and at the same time she was annoyed to hear that I call her a girl. \"I do not have time to do it again, but you saw what I did to those fools, so I advise you not to mess with me,\" Helga said coldly as she approached the soldier in a teasing way. ¨Funny, I was going to say almost the same, I just want to tell you that you are a good fighter and you are strong¨, he said smiling. ¨Thanks¨, replied Helga dryly. ¨Although ... your technique has a lot to say¨. ¨Excuse?!¨. ¨You already show me, you are strong, but your combat technique is terrible, if you were in the war you would be dead girl¨. He did not know what Helga was bothering him about more than that guy, who considered her weak or who called her a girl again. ¨Do you want me to show you how weak I am?¨, Helga mentioned as she got into combat position. ¨Please, you would not last against me, although yes, if you want to become a better soldier, come and get me¨, said the soldier as he walked to the exit, and listen as a few steps ran after him, and quickly turned around to grab a foot that goes straight to him. ¨How?¨, Helga mentioned surprised, as the soldier grabbed his foot in time to connect him in his body. ¨I told you, it was also heard as you came after me¨, the soldier mentioned with a smile, before he lifted her foot from it also giving a turn, causing Helga to fall across the canvas, which luckily they were unemployed. ¨I'll tell you one thing, you have the potential and the talent to be the best, all you need is a good guide, I can be that guide, think about it¨, said the soldier and then start leaving the gym, but before that He stopped for a moment. ¨Ah, I forgot, I'm Lyle Tiberius Rourke, nice to meet you¨, Rurke said smiling as he left the building. Helga who was still lying, hit the ground by the frustration she felt at being humiliated in that way, but at the same time she began to think about his words, it is true that she wanted to be the best, she wanted to go beyond her own limits So while he was still thinking Helga, he got up and picked up his things. ¨I'll give you young advice, do not trust that man, he'll do anything to carry out his purposes, he'll even be able to kill his own men¨, Helga listened as someone spoke back to him, and when he turned around, he found a A man of advanced age, with fair skin, white hair and mustache, the gentleman wore glasses and has a janitor's uniform. Helga quickly saw that he was the maintenance man and without saying goodbye to him, he left the gym. The lord just let out a sigh and started sweeping the floor. \"Do not say you were warned,\" the concierge said while continuing with his own. (0) (0) (0).. Helga woke up suddenly, but when she opened her eyes suddenly, he invaded her and returned the immense pain that she had, causing him to close his eyes once more. The darkness and the suffering were the only things that Helga felt because despite the fact that the crystal helped her greatly to alleviate it, the crystal did not heal the internal wounds like her broken bones from the ribs and her chest, so every time her lungs moved to breathe, made the broken bones also move, because although he hoped that he had no internal bleeding in some of their bodies, even haci causes immense pain in it, and while Helga tried to calm down, in the midst of all the darkness that she had around her, she could hear a soft and relaxing sound that began to calm her. Helga did not know where it came from, but she managed to make it calm down a bit, taking a few breaths, managing to make her open her eyes. Helga, when she opened her eyes, noticed that she was no longer on the rocky floor, and instead, she was lying on Alex's chest, while she had the blanket that she had on her head. Now she is used to shelter her and that I did not have cold, she quickly knew that the relaxing sound was that of the young man's heart. Ah, she stopped giving importance and in her mind she questioned, why did she start to remember her past? Why did she have to remember when she first met and saw Rourke? Could it be a signal ?, one in which her injuries and injuries were more serious than she thought and if she had severe internal bleeding, and that in the end she ... Quickly Helga stopped with her thoughts, she knew that she still had a lot to live, that if she died she wanted to do it in two ways; by age or in combat as a good soldier, because if it was not of any of those forms, then he would not accept it, he would repeat again and again that he would not die in a pathetic way, he would face the very death if it was necessary to maintain himself live. \"Stupid Rorurke, I'm really cursing you for what you've done to me,\" Helga said with hatred for having caused all the suffering she had in her body and also thought how stupid she was before for having agreed to be trained by him. ¨I would have listened to that old man, damn ... until the move hurts me¨, Helga mentioned as she clenched her jaw, feeling the pain of all her bones moving, but especially of her chest, so without any other option she went back to bed the chest of the boy that saved her, since she did not have much to do that we say. \"You're lucky I need this boy,\" Helga said as she returned to settle into Alex's chest, although she did not notice, maybe because she had not seen him before or because he did not live with him on the expedition, but Alex is a bit bony and skinny, something that he was not since the explosion of the volcano ... End of the Chapter. So far the chapter arrives.

I already have the story half planned when it is presented, but for the moment, we will continue enjoying this story that you enjoy reading it and I will write it. Atlantis, is not my property, belongs to their respective creators. Without more to say we begin ... Oh, and something else, some may feel uncomfortable or insulted by what will come, and I have read and / or seen how many people complain about the author for putting these scenes without warnings, so here goes. Warning; The following content can be considered for seniors, so be very careful with what you will see. Chap. 11. Moments very uncomfortable. Little by little, regaining consciousness and waking up, Alex opened his eyes, he did not know why, but each time he felt weaker each day they spent locked in the cave. ¨It must be because of hunger¨; Alex thought a little tired and while letting out a small whimper, since the little food that there was, was already getting scarce and it had already been about 5, 6, 7 days, the truth, Alex He did not keep the account, but every damn day, it was all eternity. When Alex was determined to get up to continue removing the rocks and be able to get out at once, but could not because he felt that he had something on top of him that kept him leaning against the wall. ¨But what?¨, Alex thought confused to feel the extra weight on his body, and when he looked down, he could see how Helga was lying on his chest down below, Alex remembered that during the night he accommodated his lieutenant to that she could sleep better, although she had to admit, her night was all the less pleasant since she put her back in the same hole where it filtered and all the freezing air that lashed during the night came in, definitely, it was not pleasant at all. Alex, thought of waking Helga moving it, but he thought better that she should continue to rest to prevent her from suffering and could avoid pain in the wounds, with no other option, he slowly and gently began to lift Helga so that he could put her down in that way , but in the process, when Alex was lifting Helga's head to be able to accommodate her and since she was mouths below him, her white T-shirt began to hang a bit on her body, resulting in Alex having a small glance at what was a little discovered chest of Helga, Alex quickly turned by inertia his head to side instinctively, while it was a little red on his face, for the shame he had. ¨Ok, calm, nothing happens, you did not do it on purpose, you did not do it on purpose ... ¨,mentally repeated an embarrassed Alex, because although he had been healing and as much as he could treating the wounds, he had not reached see or uncover what would be private parts of Helga's body, since for him, it would not be appropriate or decent if he did. So without turning to look forward, I managed to make Helga lie on the rocky ground, not before putting the blankets on her so that she was somewhat comfortable lying on the floor and also recharging her head. Once finished, Alex tried to forget his shame, and as seconds passed so he could calm down, and when he began to calm down ... ¨Well, if it were you, no ... sorry, if I were the one who controlled us, I would have taken advantage of the dying woman long ago to \"digress\" for a while before she dies, since it's not fun with a corpse, \"she said. malice and cruelty Alex's sub conscious, and the mentioned step of shame to rage upon hearing that. ¨WHAT YOU SAID?!, I never, I repeat, NEVER !, I \"DIVERTIRIA\" WITH HER TO THE FORCE, OR WITH ANY GIRL!¨, Alex almost yelled totally furious at his mind. ¨Oh come on, I know you want to see your perfect again and develop ...¨. \"Shut up! Just shut up,\" Alex said angrily. \"And besides, she's not going to die. ¨We'll see, we'll see¨, said the sub conscious of the annoying. After a few moments in which Alex made sure he did not hear that damn voice he had heard since Helga and the trapped, and when he did not hear them, he tried to get up off the floor, but when he was halfway there, he fell silent. , causing Alex to start breathing forcefully. ¨Well, what's wrong? ¨, Alex said to himself when feeling weak for a while, felt as if he did not have so much strength in ... ..Alex shook his head to stop thinking about it and trying not to give importance, so he tried again but giving more encouragement to himself, accomplishing his task. At a somewhat slow pace, he reached the wall where the rocks had collapsed, and taking a rock, began to remove it, little by little began to remove them one by one and he spent what could have been several minutes, but while still with his work, turning to remove a rock, could see that Helga was awake, but what left him perplexed, is that she had managed to crawl to a corner where there were several holes in the ground and managed to recharge a rock wall on her own , seriously for Alex considered it something amazing, because despite the broken bones of her, could have done, but yes, Alex noticed how her eyes were tightly closed, her jaw clenched, her chest rose and fell rapidly and It reflected an expression of pain, surely suffered a lot to get to be, although Alex wondered why she moved so far and especially the wounds that she had, but for the moment just pulled out of his pants n again when the glass and brightness, place it on the tip of the nose Helga. When the crystal stopped shining, Alex gave a tired sigh as the expression of pain began to fade, which allowed her to see Alex in front of her. \"Hello, good morning,\" Alex said politely, since in his mind he could not have come up with anything other than telling her. \"Hi,\" Helga said shortly, and although Alex did not notice, a little hurried. ¨This ... .. what are you doing here, why did you move?¨, Alex asked confused. \"Demons\" thought Helga annoyed, the only thing he did not want the boy to ask, he just had to ask. ¨Simply I wanted to move, that's all¨,said annoyed Helga,¨I advise you to continue removing the rocks guy¨. Alex, unconvinced by the argument he had just heard, started walking towards the pile of rocks, but halfway up his path, Alex turned around a bit to see Helga, and what he saw was like her uselessly trying to take off his hand The brown belt that she had, I also noticed that she was shaking her hand for the actions she did, so assuming it could be that she needed help, he again approached her. ¨Did I tell you to continue removing the rocks?¨, Helga asked seriously as she stopped trying to take off her belt. ¨And I was about to do it, but notice how you were trying to take off your belt, do you need help ?¨. ¨I do not need it ... I can do it alone¨, Helga said annoyed as she kept trying to take it off, but it was difficult to see. ¨Are you sure? If you need to be more comfortable, just me ...¨ \"It's not that!\" , Helga interrupted angrily, but giving a small sigh to feel again as it returned a small burning sensation in her throat, she calmed down, \"I just ... needed space for myself\" said Helga resigned as she lowered her look so Alex would not see her in his eyes. ¨Space ?, what do you mean by your ... ¨, Alex was asking when the pieces of the puzzle began to form in his head, take off his belt to have space, move to a safe place, sit almost in a hole , that means…. ¨Oh ... you want to make ...¨. ¨I just need my space, let me¨, said Helga seeing that it was no longer necessary to hide it, but before he knew it, Alex put his arms around her to grab her in the form of a hug and lifted her up very carefully, and before Helga could say something, felt as the boy began to untie his belt. ¨What do you think you do?!¨, Express annoyed Helga. ¨Simply I'm going to help you so you can do well, neglect, I will not see it¨, Helga listen as Alex spoke to him while he finished undoing her belt, then pulling her pants to almost reach the height of his knees and Helga turned his head to say some things to the boy, saw how Alex had his eyes closed to be able to take a little off her underwear and she could do her ... \"needs\". ¨Ready, you can do it calmly, neglect, I will not see anything¨, Alex said while he had his eyes closed and under his head-oh, and he has, surely he needed it -said Alex as he took out some toilet paper from his pockets. Helga took the paper with her hand and did not know what to think, on the one hand, she felt annoyance at being so dependent on someone, she never thought that day would come ... but, on the other hand, although she did not want to admit it, she felt grateful for That show of support from Alex. Spending a few minutes while Helga did her \"needs\" and Alex grabbed her so that she could do it, Alex even though she wanted to rush Helga, since she felt that her strength was failing her and I did not think she could last any longer, she also wanted her not to I had to work hard in your body. ¨I'm done, you can put me back together again¨, Alex heard Helga talking and nodding, he put her underwear and pants on again, when he did, he opened his eyes so he could put back his belt When he did, he saw that Helga was trying not to see him, Alex did not know how to interpret it, but leaving that aside, I help him to put her back on the wall. Alex let out a sigh and then walked to the backpack he had before, and from her he took out a canteen, when he opened it, he saw that it was only for a single simple drink, but just when Alex was about to feel the freshness of the water ... . ¨Hey, did you read that is water?¨, Helga surprised, she realizing that Alex had a canteen, could not avoid seeing the object carefully. Alex under the canteen to answer him. ¨Yes, right¨, answered Alex. \"No, no, do not tell him, do not say it, do not say it ...\" he repeated his subconscious again and again to him. \"Do you want it?\", Alex asked Helga, which made his sub conscious start calling him again and again stupid. Helga without saying a word, nods, Alex approached her with the canteen, gave him the water, but yes, Alex helped her to take it, Helga felt how that water felt much better, and when finished of taking it, I was about to thank him, but what came out of his mouth was ... \"Hurry up so we can go\", said Helga seriously, she did not want to tell him, but because of her pride, she could not tell him. But Alex to hear that just nodded and then go a little annoying to the debris. \" Why do you give water to a corpse, an extremely ungrateful corpse?\", Asked the sub again to Alex. This, however, ignored him while he continued to remove the stones to remove from the exit, to be able to go, rise to the surface, and pay for the operation of his sister, and therefore, save her. That was a great engine for him to continue, he certainly wanted to see her again. End of the Chapter. This is the chapter of today.

","Summary":" This is my first fic, and I decided to do it from one of my favorite movies and a character that I "},{"Movie":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","Title":"Yin & Yang: A Century of Healing","Author":"DimensionTraveler23","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12487700","Passage":"[Chapter 1] -In the Base of a Volcano in the Mid-Atlantic, late 1914, in the early morning- Battle ensued between two teams, as a hot-air balloon floated up in the midst of fired shots from various machines of both teams, then a tall, slender pale-skinned woman was thrown off the balloon, screaming as her voice pierced the air, falling toward the ground floor. This woman is known as Lieutenant Helga Sinclair, a German American, of great skills. Flawless with only a beauty spot beneath her left eye, she prefers her silky blonde hair braided into a low ponytail, her piercing blue eyes, full red lips, able to either flatter or intimidate anyone. She wears a white tank top, muted green pants, black gloves, and brown boots. A thud of weight hit the ground, never heard by either battling team, as Helga groaned harshly, noting her injuries. Her ankle broken, her ribs either broken or bruised, one of her wrists bruised, unbelieving that she was still alive. She looked up, huffed as she struggled to grab her flare gun out of the holster, and aimed it at the rising air balloon, and said, \"Nothing personal.\". She shot out, as she grimaced in pain with a slight grunt. Her arms gave out, and lying upon the ground. She saw the balloon completely in flames from the flare, and sighed heavily as she knew she was dying from internal bleeding and broken bones. She muttered in German as she saw the balloon fall towards her, immediately knowing her death will be finalized by the fire and lava if there was any of it, \" At least he's gone. Christopher, I miss you so much. I will see you soon. Mother, Father, do not fall in depression over my death. The boys still needs you both. Goodbye, world.\". Then her eyes widened as she saw something under the upcoming balloon, a glowing crystal blue opening almost like a door. If she would have words to describe it, she'd say that it looks like a oval which is glowing and that is not natural. The glowing door approached her, and almost immediately, Helga soundlessly shrieked as the door took her away, disappearing within a second as the balloon crashed to the ground completely, leaving the volcano to wake. -A century later in another world, late 2014, in the west side of North America, in the middle of the night- In a very small town called Kirkwood, in the state of California, rests a contemporary Californian Style Ranch House. A dark-skinned Polynesian-American man of 32 years, straight black hair, with almond-shaped chestnut brown eyes, wearing a light tan tank top with shorts. He's sleeping in his bed with his only companion, his own cat at the foot of the bed. His name is Pita Crestwood, and his cat is called Tod, because he nearly looks like his namesake, Tod the fox from one of Pita's favorite movies, as Tod the cat doesn't have the white tip on his tail. A thunderous crash sounded through the night, piercing Pita's ears. He groaned lightly, awake and alert, thanks to his skills as the Deputy Sheriff he currently is. He muttered, \"Raccoons in trashcans again.\". He pulled back his covers, turned on his lamp, as he got his feet into his slippers, briefly waking Tod who meowed in annoyance. Pita smiled, \"Go back to sleep, buddy. You don't want to mess with any raccoon, trust me.\". Tod sniffed, then went back to sleep again. Pita sighed lightly as he headed out, heading to the kitchen where the back doors is. Turning on the lights for inside, and outside, he saw the trashcans standing still, and his brow furrowed in confusion, and he opened the door, walking out, as he grew more confused as he couldn't see any raccoons, or smell any trace of skunks as he knew skunks were attracted to garbage as well. He saw a pale arm, and his eyes widened in surprise, and ran back inside to grab a flashlight, and went back outside, turning on the light, and as he got closer, he was able to see more and more beyond the pale arm. He was looking upon a 3-D live, yet unconscious Helga Sinclair, clothes intact. Pita exhaled, \"Shit.\". He leaned down, checked her for vitals, all the careful to not disturb her as he knew he would get either punched or something by a pissed off ex-mercenary, and Lieutenant. Pita saw her shiver unconsciously from the cool air, and sighed softly, knowing that he have to get her in before the weather gets colder or worse, as he knew there's bound to be a storm in the new day. He slowly and carefully picked her up bride style, and walked back inside, with flicking the outside light off, and turning another light in the living room, he gently laid her on the couch with a pillow beneath her head. Pita knew he couldn't go back to sleep, especially with the fact that Helga Sinclair is obviously very real, and lying on his couch. He only hoped that she will not freak out, yet he knew she will keep a leveled head when it comes to situations, but this is a big as hell situation, a 20th century woman in the 21st century. He sighed heavily, heading to the kitchen to stir up some hot chocolate, and maybe some coffee as well, hoping to make the situation better with some beverages once Helga wakes up.[Chapter 2] -30 minutes later- (Helga's P.O.V.) I never felt this sore yet strangely I am completely fine. I could smell the faint scent of chocolate, and coffee as well, could hear my soft breathing, yet it's accompanied by another person, due to his quiet breathing through I could hear a slight sigh here and there. My skin could feel the rough yet soft fabric below me, and judged it to be one of these sofas as I was enclosed on one side. I slowly opened my eyes to see that I was in a living room, noticing that lights was on, through I could see the enveloping of the night through windows. I was briefly confused to why I was back on the surface, when I suddenly remembered what happened in my last moments in the volcano, and exhaled a sigh. \"Glad to see you awake. I was concerned there for a second when your breathing changed.\". A slightly exotic yet smooth voice replied, confirming my suspicion that the person is a man. I looked over to take in the smiling stranger who has obviously taken me into his home, sitting in a cushioned chair, and I furrowed my brow slightly as the clothes seemed out of place yet it seems to suit him somehow, due to his skin tone, and his features. I softly asked, \"Where am I?\". The man frowned slightly, with a thoughtful look as it is if he was trying to find the right words to explain my situation. He replied, \"You're in America, specifically, in California.\". I nodded as my other suspicion was confirmed as well, as I am back on the surface. \"And what is the date?\". The man grimaced at that, and sighed lightly. with a glance at a wall clock. \"December 7, and the year...is 2014.\". I widened my eyes at that, as I realized I have passed 100 years of time, and I am still young. How is that possible? \"How did I get here?\". I spoke desperately. The man frowned further at that, \"I'm afraid I have no idea, but you're impossibly young, plus you're a woman I know from history, thanks to your army experience. I am the Deputy Sheriff of my town, and the name is Pita, Pita Crestwood. Your name is Helga Sinclair, correct?\". I smiled, \"Lieutenant Helga Sinclair at your service. Nice to meet you, Mr. Crestwood.\". Mr. Crestwood chuckled, \"In this century, we call people by first name. You can call me Pita.\". I nodded, and glanced to see two cups on a tabletop, and Pita noticed, smiled, picked up one of the cups, spoke, \"I knew people of your expertise depends on coffee, so I figured you could use a drink. It's decaf.\". He moved the cup of coffee towards me as I slowly got up upright, still resting my back upon the cushions behind me, and received it. I raised a eyebrow as I drank it, the flavor pungent yet a bit strong, and replied, \"Very good.\". Pita only nodded and drank his cup of chocolate as I smelt the scent wafting from it. A meow met my ears, and I looked over to see a red-pelted cat almost looking like a fox climbing down the stairs. \"Ah, that would be Tod, my companion and pet. Hey, buddy, did the smells wake you up?\". Pita smiled as the aforementioned Tod got closer, silent with a sniff here and there, and leaped into Pita's chair, mewed loudly in a demanding tone. Pita chuckled sheepishly, and grabbed a bowl of cream or milk from another tabletop, and placed it before Tod's mouth, \"Only the best cream for you, Tod.\". Tod went to lick it up as the bowl held up with Pita's left hand, and within his right hand, Pita kept sipping from his cup. \"I suspect that I will be awake all morning as the shock hasn't fully settled in yet.\". I responded, and Pita smiled, \"All the better as today is my day off for it's a Sunday. I shall help you, ma'am.\". I smirked, \"Just call me Helga.\". Pita chuckled, \"Barely 15 minutes since you woke up, and you are settling in fairly well.\". I held up my cup, and nodded as my thoughts about this situation filtered through my mind. In a house, in a different century, a different time, the technologies must be very developed by now. I can see that Crestwell is a clear-minded person, not like that traitor. At least, I will have help with everything yet I knew he will respect my privacy.[Chapter 3] -Almost a week later in the afternoon-(Pita's P.O.V.) I sighed heavily, shaking my head awake as I was exhausted from a particular dangerous situation, hanging my hat and suit up, relieved to feel the air hitting my arms as I now stood in a sky blue t-shirt, and my navy blue pants, and black shoes. I called out, \"Helga, I'm home!\". A answer reached me, \"In the living room!\". I walked to the pocket door, smiled wryly as I saw Helga punching and kicking the air, convincing me that she was exercising her skilled fighting style, and I saw the TV on, on the news channel. I saw Tod come in through the cat door in one of the outdoor doors behind Helga, meowing once he saw me. I chuckled, \"Hey, buddy. Did you keep Helga company?\". as I took a seat upon my favorite chair. Helga slowly stopped, smirking as she grabbed a towel nearby, \"He kept me company most of the time, but he was distracted by a bird a while ago, and went out, presumably patrolling his borders.\". She cleaned her face, as I nodded with a smile. My hand instinctively rubbed Tod's ears once he got closer, purring in delight. \"Nice job stopping the bush fire, Pita.\". Helga complimented. \"Oh, it wasn't me much. It was the firefighters that stopped it.\". I responded, as there was a bush fire situation that lasted through yesterday and today, and I only assisted with the evacuation of many people as the mayor thought that the bush fire could have been threatening people's homes, and helped with soiling the fire from a elevated ravine and a scooper machine. Helga chuckled, \"Neither way, I thought you must have been exhausted, so I got one of your leftovers out for you.\". I smiled bigger at that, and replied, \"Thanks, Helga. Oh, and I forget to mention, there is a market tomorrow. I usually go there for groceries and knickknacks if I find any. Could you like to join me?\". A hum of consideration from Helga as she thought of my offer, and asked, \"Do you think I am ready to venture out there?\". \"Helga, I asked around if anybody saw anything strange in the middle of the night, and nobody did. It must have been only coincidence that I heard something in sync with your arrival. Plus if you're more relaxed and in different clothes, anybody couldn't recognize you, and if somebody could, like me, they could think that you were a relative or the same thing I knew about.\". I raised a eyebrow, with a calm smile. Helga stiffly nodded, \"I figured about the same, otherwise people could have talked on the news. Are we going casual?\". I smiled, \"Yep, we are. (chuckles) Now, I gotta eat my food, and you..could use a shower.\". Helga playfully rolled her eyes, and left the living room, with her hand petting upon Tod's back, and whistled a tune I couldn't recognize as she distanced herself from me. I got up, and with a indignant meow from Tod, and I glanced at my watch, and chuckled, \"I swear you always got perfect timing when it comes to your meals, Tod.\". I checked the microwave, and smiled as one of my leftovers is ready to be cooked in there, and I timed the microwave, started it up. I leaned down into the counter doors below me, and opened it to grab one of the wet food containers. I hummed one of my favorite tunes as I grabbed Tod's bowl from the floor, and flipped the wet food into the bowl, and brought it down to a sitting Tod with a twitching tail which always amused me. Tod mewed once before he started eating, and soon enough, the microwave beeped out to signify that it has finished. I brought it out with a couple of mitts, and placed it on the peninsula island, grabbed a fork out of a drawer, and took a seat upon one of the stools. The house soon echoed with Helga's singing voice, in German. It's one of the more powerful songs that I could tell, yet I was amazed at how she does it, beautiful yet mysterious, just like her. She's very much ready for my world. I only hope that she would love it as I do.[Chapter 4] -The next day- (Helga's P.O.V.) Pita smiled, \"Come on, Helga! I gotta show you the best stand ever in this market!\". I chuckled in amusement, \"It better be good.\". I was wearing a light purple sweatshirt, blue pants, and my beloved boots. Pita was wearing a light blue khakis jacket over a medium green sleeved shirt, with his black pants and shoes. Pita laughed, \"Oh, it's one of my favorite food stands, which contains my most favorite food ever!\". \"Which is?\". I asked curiously as he led me through so many stands, so many people, so many colors, that I couldn't keep up to note everything that might be of threat towards me yet I have the feeling that this town is safe and well, as I saw Pita being greeted quite happily so often. Pita grinned, \"It is not one you heard of back in Germany, but you'll love it just the same. We call it 'Fried Shrimp'.\". We approached his said stand, and he nodded to one of the tables, and I smiled, walking on as I took my seat to wait for Pita as there's a bit of line before Pita makes it in front. Every person we had encountered this morning, I had introduced myself as a friend of Pita's, and that I was looking for help with my life. We were careful not to speak of everything that led me here. \"Hello, you must be Helga Katrina I have heard that my mother spoke about.\". a polite female voice spoke, and I looked over to see a woman close to my age, platinum blonde hair, with teal-ish green eyes, wearing a pink sweater, with white pants, and heels. I don't know why, yet her smile seems a bit creepy. I nodded politely, \"Yes, I am her. May I know your name?\". She smiled bigger at that, growing a bit creepier which got me wary of her, \"Oh, Rosalind Kherpe, but you can call me Rosa. Everybody does.\". I nodded in understanding, and I asked, \"Pardon me, but your mother seems to know Pita. I suppose you're one of his friends?\". \"Friends, oh yes, I'd like to think so. Yet I am so surprised to see him smiling after what happened a while ago.\". Kherpe said in happiness yet curiosity. I raised an eyebrow, \"What do you mean by Pita smiling? He has been pleasant company once I came to town.\". A tsk escaped Kherpe's lips, \"I am shocked that you haven't heard of it, but I suppose it makes sense since you're new and all. You see, Pita was married once upon a time, but that's the thing. You see, the woman Pita was in love with, she bedded lots of men in a boarding house back in the city, my, my, it was a shock to hear once that our dear deputy sheriff would marry a woman like that. I was especially devastated as I was to confess to Pita that I have harbored a crush on him, but alas, I was too late. Then Pita found her in the backyard one day, a knife in her stomach, having committed suicide. Oh, Pita was upset and heartbroken. Over time, it got better and he buried himself into his work, yet I heard that he still visits his late wife's gravestone every night after work. So, I thought I must warn you about that, and I am concerned Pita would overreact if someone was replacing his wife. So, good luck, Helga Katrina.\". She spoke longingly then she left the premises of the tables towards the market shops. Myself, I was confused yet horrified to know that Pita has gone through so much, yet having a wife who cheated on him. I shook my head no, as I could find out about Pita's side of things as Kherpe unnerved me much. Gratefully and quickly, I hid my worries and thoughts as Pita returned with his food, a bowl for me to try as well. I will ask tonight. - Later that night- I enjoyed the market very well, yet my thoughts couldn't stop running about Pita's past, if anything Kherpe said was true. I unpacked a ton of new clothes Pita bought for me from the paper bag, putting them into the amazing laundry machine, and turning it on, hearing the comforting loud noise, and I headed down the hall into the living room, smiling as I saw my communal cup resting upon the table. I noticed Pita sitting in his usual chair. I picked up my cup, the smell of coffee calming me down slightly yet I kept thinking. \"You're brooding, Helga.\". spoke Pita curiously. \"Penny for your thoughts?\". I sighed lightly, \"Someone approached me this morning at the market when you were getting the fried shrimp.\". \"Who was it?\". Pita asked. I replied, \"Rosalind Kherpe.\". Pita's face changed from a curious, calm look into a disgusted, angry look. \"You shouldn't speak to her, not ever. She has been a stalker, and she is worse than you think. What did she tell you about me?\". I exhaled as I knew I had to obey his question. \"She told me about your late wife, just the basics of how you knew her, and how you lost her.\". Pita wrinkled his nose like he smelled something rank. \"She was in a bad situation, she didn't have any choice. She used to have a choice when her brother was alive, but she was in hell every day in that bullshit building, lost in a sea of people. I first saw her in a grocery store, hiding behind her clothes, yet I saw the signs, and when she locked eyes with me, I knew. She was in trouble and I had to do something. She didn't kill herself. I knew her too well, and she was murdered.\". Pita looked pained yet angry-sad. He held up a finger to say that I wait a minute, and I nodded, and he left, headed up the stairs, barely heard his footsteps as I waited. He came back down, holding a picture, and he looked reluctant yet thoughtful. \"Careful, Helga.\". He said softly. I smiled gently as I received it from him, \"No worries, Pita. You care for this picture endearingly.\". I looked down to see a albino-skinned Caucasian woman of early 20s, with mocha brown hair, and sparkling sky blue eyes, in a lovely emerald green dress with a warm peach yellow wrap. She was smiling widely as like she's laughing in delight. Above her, I thought I saw lights, like fireworks. \"She looks lovely.\". I complimented before I looked up to Pita who smiled bitter-sweetly. \"That was the happiest day of her life next to being rescued from 'Hell'. Her name was Leana.\". I smiled, \"She must have been a fantastic woman.\". Pita chuckled, \"Oh, she was.\". I wonder if she would have liked me as well, if she was still alive.[Chapter 5] -Still the same night- (Pita's P.O.V.) I sighed lightly as I sat upon my chair, \"Leana was emotionally alone, for she had lost her brother quite a while ago before I first saw her when I visited the city. Sure, she had the other women to keep her company when she was not 'working'. I was heartbroken when I became acquainted with her, she was so timid yet she was somehow brave to talk to me when we met. She had a dear friend who encouraged her to escape with me when I followed the car, and found 'Hell' \". Taking a breath as I drank my hot chocolate for a moment, glancing at Helga's look of curiosity, and I could see her brain clicking, figuratively. I spoke again, \"Leana came to be my roommate when we escaped, and got here into town. She was actually like you a bit, she couldn't give up when she knew that she didn't want to disappoint me, and so, she had a incredible transformation, from this timid, shy, sort of brave lady into a spunky, happy, and curious woman. She became loved by the town, although I think Kherpe and a couple of others were disgusted.\". I chuckled then at a upcoming memory from my past, \"She actually bought Tod for me, and I named him myself. She said she thought I could appreciate some sort of company when she would go shopping or such. That picture was two years ago on the Fourth of July. She was overjoyed when I proposed to her after the fireworks had finished for the night. We got married a few months after that. She was concerned about not being able to have children as she was 'used' back in Hell. Either way, we lived a plentiful, peaceful life, until that day.\". \"I could never thought that I would lose her as she was happy, kissing me goodbye as I went off to work, then when I returned, Tod was crying, actually crying for help, and I called for her until I came into the backyard. Her beautiful blue eyes lost their shine, saying that she's gone. I refused to believe that she was dead until I heard sirens. I never realized that I screamed her name when I lost myself in tears and pain.\". \"Then I received a shock once I was called to the autopsy a few hours later. Leana was pregnant, barely three weeks along. She was going to tell me that night, but fate came and changed everything that day.\". I exhaled as I closed my eyes in pain as I thought of the child that could never be alive. It was too early to tell if it was going male or female. A regretful sigh answered me, and I opened them to see Helga in surprised pain. \"I'm so sorry, Pita.\". She said softly. I nodded with a sad smile. \"I admit I have moved on physically, but emotionally, it still hurts so much. And to rub everything in the wound, that Kherpe keeps stalking me, even when I put a restraining order on her a while ago.\". Helga looked pissed off at the mention of Kherpe, and actually snarled, \"Did she bother Leana too as well?\". I blinked at her fierce anger, and nodded, \"Too often to count.\". She then took deep breaths, \"I apologize for that outburst. You have became a dear friend. Do you think your wife would have liked me?\". I smiled bigger, \"Actually, when I told her of my research into becoming a officer, she came to know you in a recording of your story, and she picked you as her role model. She dreamed of meeting you and yourself teaching her how to fight like you. She would have liked you for sure.\". Helga chuckled at that, \"I could never thought I'd be a role model to any woman, but Leana would have been so much more than you have described her. I only wish that she would be still alive, and she would have said something by now.\". I nodded, then a idea came to me. \"Maybe I can speak for her.\". Helga raised a eyebrow, \"Pardon?\". I elaborated further, \"You can teach me how to fight like you in honor of my late wife, and I can commit for her, and for you as well, if you'll be my teacher.\". Helga put on a thoughtful look, and did that thing, her finger on her chin with her head tilting to the side. I waited some moments, then I saw Helga smile craftily. \"If I teach you how to fight like me, you need to do a favor for me.\". Helga spoke slowly. I sighed, \"Shoot, what's the favor?\". Helga smirked, \"You buy donuts for me every morning before you go off to work.\". I smiled at her, realizing that I could just sacrifice just a few minutes of talking for donuts, that she began to love them since I introduced her to the bakery this morning before the market opened. \"Deal.\". I concluded to Helga who smiled a thankful grin. I yawned slightly, and Helga smiled, \"We quite had a long day.\". I chuckled, \"Indeed.\". I rubbed Tod's ears as he was resting upon the rocker chair next to me, and he sniffed, blearily looking over at me, \"Wanna sleep on the bed, buddy?\". He snorted and went back to sleep. A short giggle from Helga, \"No wonder why Leana picked him for you.\". I laughed softly at that. We then dropped our cups into the dishwasher once we rinsed them out, and climbed the short steps into the bedrooms' hallway. Helga went for her bedroom, and before she even opened the door, she looked at me. \"What could you have named the kid?\". she asked curiously in a reverend whisper. I sadly smiled, \"We spoke about that if the possibility came up. Leana wanted to name the child after you if it was a girl.\". A exhale of surprise from Helga, and asked, \"And for the boy?\". I chuckled, \"Amanaki. Common nicknames for it are 'Ami' or 'Naki'. It means hope. Leana was preferable toward names that means hope because I gave her hope.\". Helga nodded, \"It quite makes sense.\". Her eyebrows furrowed in concern, \"You have said that she was murdered. Did you have any leads?\". I sighed heavily, shook my head sadly, \"Afraid not. The knife was wiped clean of fingerprints, as if the person was wearing gloves or something, and no one heard anything, no voices, nothing. Yet I have a idea, but I don't have the evidence to prove it.\". Helga then frowned, \"Neither the murderer knew you could get on into him or her if there was anything of suspect on Leana's body, or that he or she didn't want you to find out about why and how he or she wanted Leana alone.\". I nodded, \"That's about what I figured too. Thank you for listening, Helga. My soul feels a bit lighter and cleaner.\". Helga smiled a small smile, \"Of course, Pita, good night.\". She opened her door and headed in as she closed it. I padded on, to my room, opening the door, leaving it a crick open in case if Tod wants to come in, and went to bed once I changed into pjs. A last thought came through my mind before I went into dreamland. I hope you didn't mind about me disclosing everything about you, Leana, honey.[Chapter 6] -2 days later- (Helga's P.O.V.) I ran into the grooming shop, panting slightly. I saw Hannah at the front as I met her yesterday on her day off, and found that she was a employee of the shop that Tod usually goes every month to be bathed and slightly shaved. A woman pushed me as the nest door opened, and I was miffed, then shocked as I recognized the woman, it was Kherpe. I furrowed my brows as I cantered forward, \"Hannah, is Tod okay?\". Kherpe snorted, \"Why are you asking for the stupid cat? My dog deserves to be first treated.\". Hannah looked professional as she started to speak yet I saw quite a bit of annoyed frustration in her eyes when she heard Kherpe. I immediately knew that she is on my side yet she wanted to stay with her job and not get fired today. \"Helga, don't worry, Tod is fine. He's just excited today which is unusual to us until we found why. Miss Kherpe, your dog, Mr. Kibble, is not hurt at all, he's just more peppy today since he met Tod.\". \"What, did my Kibble get scratched by that mangy cat?!\". Kherpe shrieked. Hannah bit her lip like she wanted to scream, as I shot back to Kherpe, \"Tod is not mangy, plus he is Pita's cat, Tod is very behaved.\". Hannah then responded, \"The boys are quite behaving well, yet they are unusually peppy and playing with each other, and no, they are not threatening each other, just dominating each other for rank.\". Kherpe then asked, \"Then what is the problem?\". \"That's the thing, the boys are not separating from each other, and if we try to take them apart, they kick, scream, screech, bark until they are back together, then no noise.\". Hannah concluded, giving us hints. I blinked, then gasped as I remembered a lecture from Pita last week when I saw a episode that had a couple of men who's married to each other. Pita said they were gay which means guy to guy in relationships. I spoke, \"Are they gay?\". A gasp came from Kherpe as Hannah nodded affirmatively. Kherpe then snapped out, \"If that dog is gay, he is not mine at all. Gay is disgusting! I won't pay the bill for that dog. Good bye!\". She left with a swoop of her long pink shawl, her legs briefly showing her white pants as she left the shop, slapping the door. Hannah sighed, \"Well, at least Kherpe won't be coming for quite a while if I say myself.\". I nodded to agree with her. I asked, \"Are they both bathed, at least?\". A smile adorned her face, and she took out her phone, and tapped it for a moment, and turned it for me to see, and in the picture, I see Tod somehow still for his bath as I saw a dog next to him, smiling as he licked Tod's cheek, his breed looking like a hybrid of Coonhound and Bloodhound and Beagle. I didn't know why, but he reminds me of another dog I saw in recordings, known as 'movies'. I also saw my present in the movie that changed ultimately my outlook on 'him'. I looked up and smiled reassuringly, \"I'll have the boys back, please.\". Hannah nodded, and asked, \"I hope you are changing the name of the dog. He seems to hate that name, so we called him 'Buddy' as he is practically a dear friend of ours.\". I smirked, \"Don't worry, I have the perfect name. And I'll pay both bills, Hannah.\". She nodded, and left the table to tell the other employees and boss behind. I couldn't wait to see the look on Pita when he comes home not to two occupants, but three occupants in the house. This is going to be good.[Chapter 7] (Pita's P.O.V.) I grunted slightly as I stretched my arms after I hung up my suit and hat. \"I'm home!\". I waited a moment then I heard Helga call out, \"In the backyard!\". I walked on, grew curious when I heard a weak yip accompanied by a bark. I looked outside to see Helga sitting upon her favorite outdoor seat which was the hanging hammock chair, smiling at her joyful face, a teal tank top over brownish tan breeze pants. I saw Tod yipping and meowing as he was in a playful stance, bowing. I'd never imagine seeing Tod so, so playful. Sure, he can be energetic oftentimes, but he was never playful that I could see until now. A bark sounded out, and from the corner around the side of the yard, came a dog that I'd recognize anytime. \"Why is Kibbles doing here?\". I murmured to Helga when I got closer. She looked at me, half smiled, half smirked. \"He has a different name now, and Kherpe disowned him when we found out this morning after being called.\". I glanced at Tod swatting playfully at the laying dog, showing his underbelly, his ears flapping out. I spoke, \"Give me the blunt word.\". Helga chuckled, \"They are gay.\". I widened my eyes, gaping in surprise, and blinked. \"Well, Leana would have said something about this, and she'd be happy to see that our guest dog is finally having a happy ending.\". \"No, happy beginnings. His name is Copper.\". Helga concluded. I grinned, looking at the couple; unique yet different. Some people could be disgusted at seeing a cat and a dog together as becomingly mates, but not me, or Helga. It's amazing that she has went through so much, yet she literally lives for this century, than back in the 20th century that I could figure. -A month later- (Helga's P.O.V.) I sighed heavily as I finished a paper for one of my online classes, closing down the computer, still unbelieving in the fact that you can go to college without leaving home almost all the time. I was delighted to know that women are equal even more to men in this century, and I am happy to know I am having a easier time with the college fee, for Pita has done me quite a favor, and got me papers that said that I was in the military as a spy-mercenary. I was going for criminology which is a amazing category all by itself. I knew I can excel in that, and Pita knew that as well, so he was happy to support me. I got up, wearing my usual casual clothes through I had my hair into the familiar braid I liked. Pita was walking Copper while Tod was somewhere lounging, probably on the couch again. I grabbed a cup, rang up some coffee from the coffee machine, sipping as my exhaustion is going away slowly. Then I heard the doorbell ring. I checked the door hole, and scoffed lightly as Kherpe was outside, and I then remembered the voice recorder hidden inside a lampshade as I had the feeling that Kherpe will be over here one day or another. I clicked it on quickly, then opened the door, \"What brings you here, Kherpe?\". \"What, I couldn't be of some company, Helga?\". Kherpe smiled politely with a smile. I sighed, \"Would you care for some coffee?\" as I gestured for her to come in. I can only hope that Tod won't disturb us, knowing that Kherpe will insult him. I know Pita told me to stay away from Kherpe, but how would I, when she invited herself into the house, plus I knew she will tell everybody if I refused to let her in. At least Pita is away, busy to check for traps in the forest as he heard that there were some unlicensed hunters trespassing into the forest. Please, do not let Kherpe stay long otherwise I won't tolerate her, I hope.[Chapter 8] (No P.O.V.) Inside a ranch house, voices raised in anger and frustration echoed, one silky yet sarcastic voice as the older female while the younger female screamed from her own shrilly, soft voice. The neighbors both heard nothing and everything, for they saw Kherpe approach the ranch, the short conversation at the door, yet they didn't hear what was on the inside of the house until the patio doors crashed open. A catfight was ensued furiously as nails, hands, arms, legs, feet, and even teeth was seen in the dust, then a body came out, grunting in pain as like it has been kicked by a boot or shoe. Helga was the culprit, smirking, \"You have underestimated me, Kherpe. I am more than you think, and Pita knows it.\". Kherpe snapped, \"Does he? I have known him longer than you did, Katrina!\". Helga snorted lightly, \"You must leave otherwise your face will have a mark from my fist, you don't want that, do you?\". Kherpe panted heavily as she tried to get up, stumbling, \"I won't let you humiliate me. Pita belongs to me, not you, bitch!\". Helga's sky blue eyes hardened, glinting like ice, and grinned, \"You shall regret this, Kherpe.\". She jumped, brawling into Kherpe, causing the duo to fall into the side pond of the backyard, the water masking the struggle of battle between the women, fighting for one man. One desperate to have Pita forever and the loyalty of the town behind her, while another protective of Pita, and vigorous for a friend that could never be. Helga surfaced, panting as her braid swatted here and there, dripping water continuously like the rest of her hair, and her clothes completely soaked to the skin. She was catching her second wind of breath when Kherpe surfaced, angry as she grabbed one of Helga's boots, drew back, and punching as hard as she could. Helga reimbursed her kicks and punches as they went back in, crashing into the pond once more, the water thunderous and splashing into the turf grass beyond. Having enough of the water, Kherpe surfaced, furiously clutching the grass as she breathed out for fresh air. She then widened her eyes, realizing that she succeeded, as she remembered that she gave a particularly hard punch into the throat of Helga, and she looked back, looking for any trace of a hopefully dead Helga, but she got confused to see no trace, no body, almost no clothes at all, only finding the scrunchie that held Helga's braid. She immediately begun to think of a plan that would save her yet dispose of Helga easily, even if she's gone somehow. Then a idea struck her. She immediately left the premises, unlocked the gate, and locked it back to normal, leaving carefully and quietly as she knew that the neighbors are sometimes noisy, thanks to the town being small. Little did Kherpe know, is that Helga is still alive. In the deep side of the pond, after the punch, Helga was struggling for breath as knowing that the throat was a vulnerable area, thanks to her experience in the military, and 'him'. She then saw something that terrified her yet still amazed her, for it was the glowing blue door coming closer and closer. With her becoming unconscious from lack of air, and the injury to her throat, plus bruises and cuts, she immediately disappeared by a nanosecond inside the blue door, and is hypothetically dead to this world, yet she will be transported back to her own time, and world, alive yet injured.[Chapter 9] (Pita's P.O.V.) - The next day I sighed heavily as the town heard of Helga's disappearing. There were some who thought that she had simply run away, but I knew the truth. She long since has told me about the door that brought her here, and I knew she has been taken back to her own century, yet I prayed for her to come back, as she seemed to truly belong here instead of the judgmental world back in the 20th century. I was sitting upon my chair, noticing that the pair of pets, Tod and Copper was distraught yet they were curious about something as I saw their ears perking up. Copper began sniffing around the living room, with Tod following him with a meow here and there. Suddenly Copper stopped at the couch lamp post, and he barked softly, which earned Tod to jump into Copper's back, and walking up to his head. Tod then put his front paws on the lamp post, standing up upon Copper's head, and he meowed loudly as he pat out with one paw, a claw catching one of the strings of the pull lighter. He pulled it, and the lamp turned on, showing a sudden strange shadow I had never seen before. With my brow furrowed in confusion yet curiosity, I got up from my chair, and walked to the pair, smiled as I pet them, and with Tod still on Copper's back, the pair went off, probably heading for a snuggle/nuzzle fest on my bed. I leaned down, looked up as my hand reached the object, my eyes recognizing it as a old voice recorder. Helga must have brought it in the marketplace or something, yet I don't know why she chose it. I clicked the reverse as I saw it had something recorded, and it went back to the time it was turned on, presumably by Helga. I clicked play, and there were distinct voices and footsteps. They got closer as I immediately recognized Helga's voice, and frowned as I recognized Kherpe's voice. \"So, dear Helga, where's Pita?\". Kherpe asked. Helga answered, \"Walking Copper.\". A discernible snort from Kherpe, \"Pita shouldn't take in a freak like that dog.\". Helga spat, with a slight growl in her voice, \"Pita understands more than you do, thanks to Leana.\". A sigh from Kherpe, \"Does he still mope about that woman? It's not healthy for him. He should move on, get settled down with a polite and well-meaning woman.\". Helga retorted softly, \"Like you, Kherpe?\". A chuckle, \"But of course. Look at me, I am healthy, wealthy, polite, and all- good around.\". Kherpe answered. A laugh from Helga. Kherpe sharply asked, \"What's so funny?\". Helga chuckled sarcastically, \"Pita wouldn't go out with you if you were the last woman on Earth. Plus, I am sure Leana wants him to date someone better than you.\". \"How could you know about that woman's opinion?\". Kherpe growled literally. A sound of humming from Helga, \"Because it's in my gut, plus I trust and respect Pita with all my life. You never gave Pita respect, only your stupidity and annoying voice.\". Kherpe snapped angrily, \"How dare you, bitch! You are worse than that whore of a woman.\". Helga gritted her teeth, \"Think slowly, Kherpe, before you insult any further about Leana.\". A scoff came from Kherpe, \"Why do you even care for her, anyway?\". \"I may haven't met her, but I care for her as she was the wife of my dear best friend I could have ever known. Leana would be a certainly good friend to me if she came to know me.\". Helga softly answered like she was very thoughtful that moment. A bitter laugh from Kherpe, \"Ohh, this is too rich. You have the hots for Pita, bad move as I warned you that day, remember?\". Helga retorted, \"Pita doesn't deserve to be hitched to a horrible woman like you, yet I would imagine himself being happy to marry his best friend. Who wouldn't? He's funny, brave, thoughtful, playful, and about the most honorable man I ever came to know in all my life, and that's saying something, Kherpe.\". Kherpe snarled, \"You're just like that awful woman who stole Pita from me. I couldn't imagine the past being repeated, but who cares? I am going to kill you, just like her.\". \"You what?!\". Helga growled loudly. Kherpe laughed evilly, \"Oh, how she screamed for me to stop. I knew I was free from her as she was a demon from hell, stealing Pita under me.\". \"How could you?! You killed a innocent woman, and a pregnant one at that as well!\". Helga shouted angrily. Silence for a moment, and then a snarl from Helga, \"You took away a family from Pita, and for that, you deserve punishment!'. A crash came out with a pained scream from Kherpe, and grunts of agitation from Helga, then I heard doors crash open. I clicked stop, and exhaled a long breath I didn't realize that I was holding, and thoughts bombed inside my mind, from Kherpe, Leana's death, the surroundings of that day, and yesterday, and finally Helga. I remembered her basic confession that she came to love me for who I am, and I exhaled once more as I remembered fond days where Helga would teach me to fight like her, laugh sarcastically when I told a joke, her rare, beautiful smile when she came to like my compliments about her in her scenes in the movie, and how her eyes light up when she would literally inhale a donut, and her unique way when she thinks up a idea or plan. I really care for Helga, and I..love her for who she was and is. Leana would have given her blessing and more, that much I knew, thanks to our time spent, through brief. Helga, wherever you are, on the surface, or in Atlantis, be safe and well. Please come back.[Chapter 10] -The same day, yet in 1915, under the Atlantic Sea, underground in the city of Atlantis- (Helga's P.O.V.) I groaned lightly as I woke up in a room that has lanterns which contained fireflies. The walls are whitewashed pale tan, the fabrics all around are vibrant colors, through the most popular are light blue and cream, and there are open-air windows. In Atlantis, once again. Who found me and bought me here? For some reason somehow, I had my old clothes back on myself through they're pretty worn down, it's like I was just found in time before the volcano erupted, yet the bruises are new, as I knew the shape of them. Pita and Kherpe are real, it was not a dream or a vision. Footsteps reached my ears and I turned around to see one of the doors open, a Atlantean man looking inside to check if I had woken up, determining by his curious yet polite facade. I nodded slightly as he saw me, and he smiled stiffly as he fully came in. He has his torso half-covered in a toga of dark blue and silver cream, his dark skin tattooed. On his chin, under his lips are a blunt upside down fork, the line from the lips, forming into three lines jutted into the chin. And on his right shoulder is a hook shape, like Kida's spear. His white hair is a spiky Mohawk with the sides tucked into a ponytail. Determining by his tattoos and posture, I figured that he is a hunter or a scout. \"Have you slept well?\". He asked softly yet his voice feels like it can fill a room all by itself. I spoke firmly, \"I have. I presume you have bought me here?\". He nodded, replied, \"I have. I healed your cuts yet your injuries had to be healed by our medicine woman. I am afraid you'll have to bear these bruises quite for a bit. I am called Nilumansia. My nickname is 'Nilu'.\". I nodded in understanding, \"Do I suspect that the Princess wants to see me now?\". Nilu frowned slightly, \"The queen Kidagakash has ordered it so that you must obey once you have awaken. She and King Milo thought that you were dead.\". A sigh escaped my lips, \"I survived because of fortune. And for my past injuries and bruises when you found me, I had lost a battle with a rather pissed off creature.\". Nilu immediately perked up, alert as his eyes widened, \"Could you describe the beast?\". I blinked, tried to think of something I had researched about Atlantis back in the 21st century, and then found it. \"It looked like a mix of a bat and a reptile, maybe crocodile. It was big as one of your machines you flew in during the battle in the volcano, and numerous teeth.\". Nilu exhaled, \"Ah, that was a Osnibros.. They are vicious hunters, yet their meat is excellent. Through what is a crocodile?\". I smirked, \"Crocodiles are huge reptiles with teeth, low to the ground when on earth, yet very excellent swimmers in the water.\". He nodded, and gestured for me to get up and follow him. I did what he has gestured, and we headed out of the room, out into a hallway. I figured I was in the palace itself, as I only saw the throne room. I murmured, \"Never thought that Thatch would be king.\". Nilu smiled wryly, \"He has done so much for our queen and our city, he has stayed behind to rebuild Atlantis as it should be centuries ago. King Milo has become the partner of Queen Kidagakash, yet they are awaiting to be married soon.\". I chuckled, \"Figures since they're a match for each other. It was obvious for me as it was for the others in my group.\". Nilu laughed a bit at that, \"Teeg. I believe you are the woman called Helga Sinclair, are you not?\". \"I am she.\". I answered firmly. We soon made it to a couple of doors as the hallway was long. Nilu knocked on it, \"Your Majesties, Helga Sinclair is awake and here with me.\". \"Send her in.\". announced Kida clearly behind the door, and Nilu opened one of the doors, gave me a small smile and whispered, \"Fortune to you, Helga.\". I smiled at him, returned the saying, \"Fortune to you, Nilumansia.\". I hoped I said it right, and Nilu smiled brightly, and I knew I said it properly to the last letter. I then came in, seeing the Princess and Thatch sitting respectively upon chairs of some kind, which I suspected as the sitting/living room in one of their rooms as they aren't married yet, plus the single bed was a clue as well. I saw Thatch in his now-present Atlantean clothes, yet the tattoo on his left shoulder is not yet there, and I suspected that he will earn it on the wedding day. Kida was watching me warily with curiosity in her eyes, with Thatch seeming nervously optimistic with baited breath. I pray that they will listen to me as I have grown to respect them. Thatch will be easier, yet the Princess, no, Queen will be harder as I bought about her father's death, and the near-death of her city. I wonder if the Crystal will see this meeting as it clearly has a consciousness of its own through their crystals. I hope I can go back home to Pita.[Chapter 11] -3 months later in 2015- (Pita's P.O.V.) I smiled softly as I watched one of my dear friends get married to another friend of mine. They often said that I got them together by chance. The town was happy for them as I was. \"I give you Mr. Eric Ronnel and Mrs. Hannah Ronnel.\". The priest announced after the couple's kiss. It's hard to believe that a former dog groomer would be married to a firefighter yet they defied beliefs in this town. It's about time a happy beginning had come since weeks ago when a former citizen of our town was convicted for charges of murder, attempted murder, stalking, violating a restraining order multiple times, and nearly injuring a officer when he restrained her back. Rosalind Kherpe was served a life sentence without parole; 40 years and 6 months. I was greatly disgusted with her, as most of the town was. Her parents were furious, yet understanding when they spoke with me. Last I heard of them, they bought a RV, and left Kirkwood forever, with the donation of the house to the town. Of course, Helga's voice recorder helped so much, offering precious evidence, enraging Kherpe when she heard it. The judge and mayor was very disgusted after that, so within days, the jury served the judgement, with the judge gladly giving the life sentence. Cheers interrupted my thoughts, and I smiled as the couple came to me, \"Thank you for the help with the anesthetics, Pita.\". Eric smirked, his brown hair swept back, his moss green eyes shining in happiness, being in a awesome suit. I chuckled and nodded. Hannah sadly smiled, \"I am sorry that Helga isn't to be here, celebrating my wedding day. But thank you for having the space for the dogs outside, with the cats inside here along with their owners, of course.\". She pushed back a strand of her cinnamon red hair, her soft brown eyes glittering in sympathy yet happiness, looking very lovely in her ivory cream gown. I shook my head, \"A unusual wedding calls for unusual guests, after all, it makes sense to your dog groomer past, and your rescues, from both of you.\". Eric laughed and one-armed hugged me heartily, and Hannah hugged me gently, and whispered, \"Just hold on, Pita, and your dream will come true.\". She pulled back with a thankful smile and a slight nod. I smiled widely as I knew I am happy today yet I am a bit sad as Helga isn't here. I listened to the nearby and far chatter of the town as they were all here today, and I grew concerned as I noticed it has lessened down to a murmuring of chatter. A soft hand placed upon my shoulder with a accompanied voice I never thought I could hear for a long time. \"Missed me, Pita?\". I turned around with a gasp, and before my eyes, stood a grinning Helga Sinclair in a teal blouse and long black skirt, and her beloved boots. I exhaled a breath, and replied, \"Very much. I heard your voice recorder. Is it true?\". Helga widened her eyes, and understood the line under my question, and smiled, \"To answer that, I must say something a new friend told me before I came back.\". She whispered softly. I gestured for her to go on, and she replied a quote I never thought to hear again. \"'Time can change things, but you can guide and change them from your heart.'\". I exhaled a surprised breath, realizing that she had met Leana somehow, and that Leana has truly given her blessing for me to have Helga in my life forever as she gave her blessing to Helga as well. I smiled brightly, \"I love you, Helga.\". Helga smiled wider, her beautiful blue eyes sparkling at my confession, and replied strongly, \"I love you, Pita.\". I sighed, and gently put a hand on her cheek as I get closer and closer, the space closing between us, and Helga's hands came to rest upon my chest, and with a small nod and flutter of her eyes, I finally kissed her, the passion and love fulfilling inside us as we clasped tighter around each other, barely hearing the town cheer and whistle for us. Happy beginnings, indeed.[Chapter 12] -A week later- (Helga's P.O.V.) I fidgeted with my bouquet of red, yellow, blue, lavender, green, and white roses, as I stood before the aisle, covered by a black curtain so anybody won't see me until the right moment. I was happy that I was getting married, yet I was sad as my father wasn't here to bring me across the aisle, or Christopher to give Pita his blessing. Yes, Leana gave her blessing for us in that important quote of hers, but Christopher haven't. I murmured, \"Christopher, if you only can hear me, I only wish for you to give your blessing for us. I am not replacing you with Pita, you are always my first love, and that will remain in my heart forever. Pita makes me happy, he certainly has a bit in common with you, but he is entirely different from you. He dearly loves me. I have changed, yes, but that doesn't mean I won't forget you, Christopher. I love you, past and future, my silly man.\". \"Well, I was going to come here, really, but that speech pinched it all in one, darling.\". A long-lost yet familiar voice sounded out, gentle with emotion. I quietly gasped as I looked up to see a faintly glowing Christopher, in his beloved army uniform, his aura warm cream white. His shining hazel eyes, his smooth, yet shaggy brown hair, and his bright smile, and his skin a healthy tan. I exhaled, \"Christopher.\". He smiled bigger at the sound of my voice. \"You look beautiful, Helga, you have certainly picked a good man to be with. I am very happy for you.\". I smiled, blushing slightly as I pushed a strand of my hair back, the sound of my pearl white/very light sea-green foam gown swooshing, and the murmuring of the crowd beyond the curtain. My hair was in a half-updo, and half braid. \"Thank you, Christopher. Are you even supposed to be here?\". I asked curiously. Christopher smiled softly, \"Only you and Pita can see me. I'll last until the end of the reception, then head back home.\". \"And my family?\". I asked in concern. \"Your family continues on through your brothers, in the form of generations. Your parents are just doing fine up there, forever together as you have remembered.\". Christopher concluded. I smiled, \"And now with me.\". Christopher nodded, then the wedding song came on, and he offered his arm, \"Shall we, Helga?\". I smiled gratefully, and accepted his arm into the crook of my arm, and we entered the aisle, smiling brightly as I saw Pita at front besides the priest, his eyes widening at the sight of me, his mouth gaping, then he glanced at Christopher, with a mild surprise in his eyes. Pita looked slightly at me, and I nodded with a signal, and his eyes widened a fraction wider, immediately understanding what I meant. The wedding went incredible, more than I'd ever imagined or remembered. The reception went wonderful, with the observing, thoughtful eyes of Christopher. Pita finally met him officially. \"Well, Pita, you have found a incredible woman in Helga. Promise me that you'll take care of her for me.\". Christopher said at the first moment once I and Pita was able to get 'alone'. Pita smiled gratefully, \"I promise, sir, with all my heart. Helga has become such a important part of my life and I will never let her go. Yes, I loved Leana, but it's time to move on with new beginnings.\". Christopher chuckled, and replied, \"Oh, and before I forget, Leana said that she'll never forget you either.\". Pita smiled thankfully, \"Thanks for the message. If it wasn't for you and Leana, we'd never met each other, either in this century or in Helga's time.\". Christopher grinned at that and looked at me. \"Be well and free, Helga. 'He' won't hurt you anymore.\". he said. I smiled, and kissed his cheek, and pulled back, \"I know. I believe I truly, no, always belong here with Pita, and with you in my heart, Christopher. I hate goodbyes.\". \"I know. Don't get in too much trouble, guys. I will see you when it's your time to go, okay. Ta-ta for now.\". Christopher told us both with a big smile before he slowly vanished, presumably heading back to heaven. Pita looked at me and smiled, \"Shall we go home, darling?\". I simply nodded, and we left, with happy smiles from our beloved pets, Tod and Copper, heading for home, our home. This is only the new beginning to our lives.[Chapter 13] -Nearly a year later, exactly by 9 months- (Pita's P.O.V.) I grimaced as my hand literally lost feeling from the hard clutching of Helga's grip. \"Any moment now, love.\". I said quickly. \"Speak for yourself, Pita William Crestwood! I'll never let you get near me ever again! Hell, it hurts!\". Helga snapped with a growl at me, and I flinched physically with my hand drawing out from Helga's grip. I was grateful that Helga had convinced me that we can do a home birth for our twins, soon to come. Luckily, a few of the hospital staff has come to help deliver them. I asked, \"How much longer, doc?\". The head doctor, a old friend of my mother, Samuel grinned, \"Actually, one of them is coming in a minute, if you can push now, Mrs. Crestwood!\". Helga grunted in pain as she contracted and pushed with all her might this time, and to my surprise and happiness, the first baby's born. With Samuel's skill, he was able to help the baby breath, and sure enough, I heard a loud, yet healthy scream. I exhaled in relief as I saw Samuel hand the baby to the nurse as I saw that it was a boy, my firstborn son. \"Helga, it's a boy! We got a firstborn son!\". I called out happily as I looked at Helga, sweating yet looking all the beautiful to me. She's panting yet she got the strength to smile, \"Is he okay?\". \"He looks great and sounds good from that first scream he did. Now we got another one coming. Just hold on, love.\". I declared as I kissed her forehead. She heaved a breath, and grimaced in pain, \"Geez, it's so hard, Pita! I don't think I can do it again.\". I frowned and touched her shoulder gently, \"Helga, you can do it. It's our second twin. How badly do you want to see our kid?\". Helga narrowed her eyes, and inhaled a breath and exhaled deeply, \"Very badly. I've been trained for all kinds of scenarios, and this doesn't count, but the pain counts, so bring it on! Doc, how many pushes?\". We looked at Samuel, and he suggested with a reassuring smile, \"Just two or three pushes, ma'am. I am ready to receive the second baby, so in the count of three, give a push. One, Two, Three!\". Helga grunted as she pushed hard, swallow breaths escaping her mouth. Samuel looked up, \"Just another push. I can feel the baby's head. Take your time before you're ready once more, ma'am.\". Helga panted heavily, and looked at me, and I smiled reassuringly to her, \"It's okay, it's okay. Just another push, and soon, we'll have both twins in our arms!\". Helga smiled gratefully with her bright blue eyes sparkling in happiness yet exhaustion. She looked at Samuel, \"Tell me when!\". Samuel glanced down, then up, and called out, \"One, Two, Three!\". Helga once more grunted, this time louder, as she pushed very hard. I saw Samuel move to catch the baby, and soon enough, I heard a scream from the baby, signifying that it's healthy too. Samuel grinned at us, \"It's a girl, you got a daughter!\". Helga exhaled a breath of exhaustion as a smile adorned her face, one strand covering her eye, as she leaned back against the headboard. I kissed her cheek, pushed back the strand, and stared into her eyes, \"You did wonderful, Helga.\". She cupped my chin, and moved slightly to kiss me on the lips, and we heard soft cries as we looked up to see Samuel and the nurse, Erica, holding one baby each. Our son was obliviously bundled in a blue blanket, while our daughter was bundled in a cream blanket. Helga sat up slowly with my help, and under a minute, we received our babies. Myself holding our son while Helga held our daughter. I was lost in love as I never took my eyes off my son, so perfect, all 20 fingers and toes intact. He has received Helga's nose, my chin, while a wisp of his hair is a dark mix of our hair colors; a cinnamon brown, and his skin tone is a shade darker than Helga's skin tone. \"He's beautiful, Pita. And so is our daughter.\". I smiled as I gestured to trade our babies, and Helga smiled, and so we did. Now with my daughter, she literally has me wrapped in her finger, intact with all 20 fingers and toes, beautiful. She has received Helga's cheekbones, my nose, while a tiny wisp of her hair is silky blonde, just like her mother, and her skin tone is a shade lighter than my skin tone. \"Do you think they're gonna open their eyes any minute now?\". I exhaled. I heard a chuckle, and I glanced over to see Helga cuddling our son closer, and said, \"Of that, I have no doubt. Now, for names. You still on for 'Amanaki' for this little guy?\". I nodded, \"Yes, I am. And for his middle name, you can do that one.\". Helga smiled at that, and glanced at our son, and replied, \"I like 'Pepin', it means petitioner.\". I murmured, \"Amanaki Pepin Crestwood. It rings well with me.\". Helga smiled. She then asked gently, \"I have a idea for our little girl.\". I glanced again at our daughter, and back to Helga. Helga mused thoughtfully for a minute, and then grinned as one popped up. \"How do you feel about 'Lilli'?\". I nodded, \"A pure name for a beautiful girl. May I do the middle name?\". Helga nodded, and I smiled, \"What do you say for her middle name to be 'Christina?\". Helga widened her eyes slightly, and exhaled as she understood that I knew she did give 'Lilli' to honor Leane, and now I just did the same, honoring Chirstopher by giving the name 'Christina' for our daughter's middle name. Helga smiled at that, and said, \"Welcome to our home and world, Amanaki Pepin and Lilli Christina Crestwood.\". A pair of whimpers accompained just a second later, and we both exhaled a breath as we saw our children's eyes. Little Naki has dark hazel eyes, and Lilli surprised us both for she's bi-colored. Her right eye is light ice blue while her left eye has my chestnut brown color. We looked up at each other, and I grinned, \"I think our children has begun their happy beginnings by claiming their names.\". Helga sighed lightly, \"Christopher and Leana must be proud of us by now. Our lives has barely begun, and now, look at us. Our family just grew.\". I nodded, \"Yes, and the town has grew by just a bit once more.\". Helga chuckled to agree with me, and we went back to glance upon our children, forever belonging in our arms and our lives. Life just got better, no, fantastic.[Chapter 14] -Epilogue- Pita and Helga's friends, Hannah and Eric also have welcomed a son who has born a couple of weeks before the twins. His full name is Roscoe Tadi Ronnel. He has a few strands of Hannah's cinnamon red hair, baby blue eyes with a bit of moss green speckles, meaning that the eyes will change into full moss green in a while, and pale peach tan skin. And for the dog/cat couple, Tod and Copper, the boys adopted a pair of Cheagle sisters from a abandoned litter that a neighbor on the other side of town found and now was giving out, of course with Pita and Helga's permission and curiosity. They look different in colors, but they behave similarly with some attitude differences. The first sister is given the name, 'Julia', a feminine version inspired by one of Helga's favorite movie dogs. Her pelt is soft brown with a black stripe from muzzle to forehead, and white socks, and for her eyes, they're dark brown. Julia's sister, her name is Nana. Her pelt is light black with a dark brown tip on her tail, and a cream heart-shaped mark on her chest. Her eyes are light brown. Tod and Copper love their daughters. They sure fill the house with energy, through the twins fill it up with shrieks of laughter as they grow up. Rosalind Kherpe, let's say she left the world some time later after a bit of fierce humiliation from a jailer, so in other words, she committed suicide. From Helga's last words of her old time, Atlantis has been rebuilding their city very well, and that Kida and Milo officially are wife and husband. Of course, Atlantis leaves a mark on everyone, so Helga does have her own crystal necklace, with a extra one for Pita, and Helga has a blue Atlantis-encrypted tattoo on her left arm. It looks like a series of leaves weaving around the source; a sun encircled within a star. Helga says the symbols mean bravery, hope, life, and knowledge. So, in the middle of Helga's pregnancy, Pita went for his own tattoo, going for his right shoulder. It looks like a look-alike of Milo's tattoo, except in cream white to contract with his dark skin. The only difference is that the star-shaped circle encircling the entwined stars are gone. Helga was impressed. The town's gift of the Kherpe house has been changed entirely into a duplex for people to rent or own their respective rooms, which has grown the population of Kirkwood a bit more. All together, Kirkwood including Pita and Helga and their family, friends, has found their new beginnings. ","Summary":" -In the Base of a Volcano in the Mid-Atlantic, late 1914, in the early morning- Battle ensued betwe"},{"Movie":"Bloomington","Title":"Catherine's Life","Author":"eclecticlady","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12266398","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter I It has been a month since Catherine left Bloomington. She never thought about leaving the town but circumstances; break-up with Jackie and losing her job put her in a difficult position. At first, she did not give up, she resisted. She started searching for teaching positions at nearby colleges but her reputation followed her everywhere. Not a single college administration was willing to hire her due to already spread rumors. She was not interested in working as a therapist and she especially did not want to work as a counsellor in a high school because rumors will definitely follow her there too. There were no other options for her. Bloomington is not a megalopolis. Her choices were limited. Spending more than a year in search of a job and perspective for her life, she decided to leave the town. All this time she was living with the money she inherited from her parents. She was lucky enough to have this option but she could not imagine herself living like this any longer. After deciding to leave the town, she faced difficulty of choosing. She did not know where to go. It was easier for her to decide when she graduated from Stanford. She had a house in Bloomington and there were colleges nearby the city, so there was a destination. However, it was different now. There were many cities and choosing one was not easy. She was sure about two things: First, she needs to leave Bloomington. Secondly, she should stay away from California, hence Jackie. Although she and Jackie made a friendly closure, Catherine knew that going back together was out of question. Besides, Jackie's career progressed enough and probably paparazzi were around her all the time. This kind of life was not for Catherine. She contacted a few of her college friends letting them know she is looking for a job in other cities. She also emailed her professors from Stanford asking for their assistance. She was lucky; Professor Hecht gave her a great recommendation letter after he asked for her resignation. After a few weeks she made the radical decision, an old professor from Stanford contacted her informing about a vacant teaching position at NYU. She was hesitant at first. Sure, she decided to move to another city but moving from Bloomington to New York was like dropping a fish from fish-tank into the ocean. After thinking whole day, she decided to apply. It is not as she is going to move immediately. She still needs to get a job offer. Until that time, there might be other opportunities too. Almost a month later Dr. John Walters, Dean of Psychology Department at NYU, contacted her. He asked casual questions like \"Why do you want to join NYU?\", \"Do you want to continue on teaching or is it a temporary occupation until you find something else?\", \"In case you are hired, what will be your contributions to the institution?\" etc. She managed all the questions well, until interviewer asked: \"What was the reason for you to leave your previous employer?\" After applying for the job, Catherine thought repeatedly about how she will respond to this question if there will be an interview. This was a standard question asked during an interview. Therefore, she knew they would ask her about this issue. Although she had a ready answer to that, she stuttered. While answering she realized that they could call her previous employer before calling her and became terrified. She said: \"I had a house in Bloomington and after graduation, I decided to return back. Since there were colleges around the city, I was sure there would be a job for me. After teaching a few years, I realized that the university is not the place where I can use my capacity fully and after some time, I was bored and decided to quit in order to find another job. It was later I realized that one should find another job before quitting the old one\". Dr. Walters noted that many academicians applied for the position but they chose a dozen candidates among others and Catherine was one them. He noted that Catherine's latest research on reversal of self-denial impressed him a lot and he thinks there will be enough support for her to continue her researches at NYU. After ending phone interview, Catherine smiled at how her research played a role on her life. How many great memories are linked to that research? If she will get the job, this will be one, another will be library where she and Jackie... No! No more Jackie, Catherine thought to herself. The life must go on but this time without Jackie. Now it was only her. After a few weeks, Catherine still did not have any feedback from NYU and there were no other opportunities in the job market. She started to feel anxious, she started going crazy. She cannot tolerate unemployment anymore. She even thought about calling Hecht and begging him for a job. It all ended, when she received a call from NYU. They invited her to New York for an interview. She had a panel interview with the department head and a few other notable professors of the department. She briefed them about what kind of classes she is willing to teach and how she is going to design those courses so the students would be encouraged to participate in the class. After presenting her vision about her potential career in NYU, one of the professors thanked her for being well prepared and organized. She even complemented Catherine's enthusiasm and motivation. Catherine reached her house in Bloomington in the late evening. She texted her dog sitter informing she will take Ethan in the morning. She was so tired that she decided to go to bed without eating anything. After having a breakfast and bringing back Ethan home, she checked her email box and saw an email from NYU. Holding her breath, she opened the email and saw an attached job offer document. She smiled and threw herself on the nearby couch.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Now she lived in an Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan. It has been a month since she moved into her new apartment. It was a small apartment, a tiny one comparing to her house in Bloomington. There was only one bedroom and a bathroom, living room and kitchen were small. Nevertheless, it was nice and comfortable, and neighborhood was peaceful. She was still busy with settling down since she did not bring all her stuff. She decided to bring the most important stuff with her and buy the rest after moving in. The first day she moved in, she hugged Ethan who was already homesick and promised him more interesting life than ever. She consoled herself thinking she will get used to it. At least, she was not alone; Ethan was still with her. Moreover, classes were going to begin in a few weeks. She probably will not think about this stuff while she is working. The only thing she went through trouble to bring with her was her precious Porsche. In the beginning, she thought about selling it and buying a new car in New York. Then she changed her mind after imagining all the trouble of choosing and buying a new car. Instead, she shipped the car to New York. Now she lived in a tiny apartment, her only consolation was her expensive car, which still made her feel better. Classes started and she was happy to go back to teaching. Her classes were more crowded than in Bloomington but this did not bother her. She was sure that moving to New York will change her life; she will be facing new challenges and opportunities. These all are for good she constantly repeated to herself every morning, while standing in front of her bathroom mirror. A month later, she already made up leeway. She spent most of her time at work; when she was not teaching, she was in her office redesigning her course curriculums, finding new materials for further reading, and when she was not in her office, she was in the university library writing new articles to publish in Psychology Journals. She also had time to get to know some of Psychology department staff. Everyone was friendly enough trying to help her with new atmosphere. She even went out with some of staff for a coffee or lunch a few times. Her life was getting better and normal, and she almost forgot about the problems that brought her here. She was not happy but she was OK, finally she was peaceful. There were no rumors concerning her personal life and everyone respected her. It was enough for making her feel calm. On a November evening, when she was in the library she realized it was late and she glanced up around to see who else was there. She saw nobody except a student sitting at the next table in front of her. Bored by all the reading and writing she had done that day, Catherine started attentively watching the girl in front of her. The student was a young woman who tilted her head down on a journal. She had a pen in her left hand. She was calmly taking notes while reading the journal. There were other journals and books on the table too. Probably she was writing a paper or researching on a course topic. She had a porcelain skin tone and dark shoulder length haircut. Because of her side swept bangs, covering half of her face Catherine could not see her face. When Catherine realized that, she does not need to see her face and she better conclude her work here and go; the young woman lifted her head and gazed at Catherine who was staring at her. They were close enough to each other for Catherine to see her big dark blue eyes, Greek shaped nose and oval chin. She was an attractive young woman in mid-twenties. She probably was a Master's or PhD student, Catherine thought to herself. She was older for being an undergrad student. Then she realized that the young woman is still looking at her and she better say something in order not startle her. Since the dramatic humiliation with her previous employer, she has lost all her confidence and communicating with other people was not so easy as it was before. The girl was still looking directly into her eyes and Catherine could not think of anything to tell her. \"Shit\" Catherine thought to herself.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 The pause probably lasted about a minute but Catherine thought it lasted eternity. Finally, the other woman broke the silence. \"Probably you did not expect to see another person here at this hour\" she grinned cunningly. This caught Catherine off guard. At first, she thought it was her imagination. The look on the other woman's face persuaded her that it is not. She heard her own stammering: \"Yes, you are right. It is just… This is not the first time I stay so late in the library and I always leave it last. I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable\". The other woman flashed her a weird smile and said, \"It is OK, and it did not bother me at all. Just FYI\". Catherine responded with a smile and looked down at her paper. While looking through her notes Catherine could not feel easy since she felt someone glancing at her. She rushed to finish her reading and taking necessary notes. Then she stood up, put on her trench coat and went towards the doors taking her papers and bag before she left. She was glad that she left since she did not feel comfortable in the library. This was the first time she felt so uneasy. Before this evening, she never saw anyone who would stay so late but it was not just it. The woman in the library was strange and unreal. Either she was figment of her imagination or she was someone unpleasant. Once she was outside of the library building, she stopped, raised her head up a little bit, and exhaled. She wished to be back at home as soon as possible and have a hot bath. Suddenly the sound of door opening made her come to herself. She felt someone walking from behind and stand next to her on the right. Catherine turned her head to the right and saw the woman in the library. Before Catherine could do or say anything, the woman said, \"I like New York evenings. They are so magnificent. Evenings in this city are not indicator of the end of a day\". Catherine noticed a little bit of accent in her talking and immediately responded by asking, \"So you are not from New York?\" \"No, I am not,\" said the other woman. Then she pulled a cigarette pack from her pocket. She wanted to pull a cigarette from the pack but stopped right away. She looked at Catherine and passed the pack to her but Catherine rejected: - Thanks but I do not smoke. - So do I. This is something I use from time to time as a tool for relaxing. - Quite unhealthy tool it is. I always thought people who do not smoke regularly but carry a pack of cigarettes with themselves try hard to look cool. Catherine flashed a smile at her with intention to put her in her place and finalize the conversation. However, the young woman did not seem offended at all and responded immediately. - Cigarette and being cool? Well, I never saw a correlation there but believe me; I have passed the phase of trying to look cool long ago. - Aren't you a student? - Yes, I am. I am studying for a PhD… but not at this university. - Then which one? - Columbia University. - Oh, that sounds great. Then what are you doing here? - I work as a part-time instructor at NYU. In the department of Sociology. Therefore, I come here from time to time to work on the reading list for the courses I teach. She caught Catherine off guard. It was the second time during the evening. Catherine looked at her once more. She was young and tall but shorter than Catherine was for an inch or two. She did not look like a professor but more like a TA. The woman took a cigarette from the pack and lit it. - Pardon me; it is hard to believe. You are so young. - I get that a lot. By the way, I'm Alexandra Slonim. She smiled and held out her hand. Catherine introduced herself while shaking hands with her. - Nice to meet you Professor Stark. Right? - Yes. I teach at the department of Psychology. - Nice… I love Psychology. I minored in Psychology when I studied for BA in Sociology and used the knowledge of those approaches for my own researches. - Great to hear that a Sociologist finds Psychology useful. You guys always undermine its importance. Catherine smiled at her. The conversation was getting interesting but it was almost 12 a.m. - It was nice to meet you, Professor Slonim. It is getting late and I should go home before my dog gets worried. - Pleasure was mine. I should also rush home; it has been a long day. However, the next time you see me please call me Alexandra. - How do you know if we are going to meet again? We are in different departments. Probability of us meeting again is quite low. - Believe me. We will definitely meet again. Good night, Professor Stark. Greetings to your dog. She turned away and moved towards a parked motorcycle. Catherine moved towards her car and when she was inside of the car, she saw in the rare mirror Alexandra sitting on motorcycle and putting on a helmet. She laughed and said to herself, \"And she does not try looking cool.\" While turning the engine on, she thought she already came across the name Slonim but she did not remember where.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Catherine felt sudden exhaustion. Working all day long started to affect her. She decided not to stay after classes and go home to have a rest. She even refused going out for dinner with her colleagues bringing up an excuse about feeling down and sick. Actually, she was not lying. She was not sick but she felt down for some reason. Probably, lack of sleep and long hours of work without rest made her like this, she thought to herself. Once she was at home, she cooked herself nice meal and had her dinner. Since she was feeling guilty for not spending enough time with Ethan, she took him for a walk and at the same time, she paid a visit to supermarket to buy a few stuff for home. Once they were in the house, she laid down on the sofa with Ethan next to her on the ground. \"What would you like to watch buddy?\"- She smiled at him grabbing TV remote control and then added, \"Let's see if there is anything interesting for both of us\". She turned on the TV and started switching channels. She stopped on one channel after she saw Jackie's image. The presenter was talking about Jackie's career, which drastically went up right after premiere of Neptune movie. Apparently, she already signed up for two more projects and one of them is going to be a huge deal. Catherine was happy for Jackie. She could not have imagined her to stay with her in Bloomington. She would feel guilty for a lifetime to deprive her this opportunity. Besides there was no guarantee that Jackie and her would last forever. Probably, they would break up anyway. \"What would happen if we still stayed together?\" Catherine asked this question herself frequently. Catherine turned of TV and leaned down to hug Ethan. \"Do you also miss her?\" Ethan looked at her with sad eyes and Catherine did not know whether it was due to moving to New York or because Ethan also missed Jackie. She exhaled deeply. Then she stood up to take her laptop from her briefcase and sat down. She turned on her laptop and opened her email box. It took some time for her emails to load. While waiting she remembered the encounter with the woman in the library a few days ago. Slonim? Where did she hear that surname before? Forgetting about her emails, she opened Google and typed Alexandra Slonim. As soon as she pressed on the enter button, the results emerged on the monitor very quickly. She clicked on the first link, which was a Wikipedia page. She saw a photo of the familiar face. She started reading about Alexandra. Alexandra Slonim was a so-called prodigy in the field of Sociology. She graduated from Yale with a major in Sociology and a minor in Psychology as she mentioned to Catherine. Then she concluded her Master's degree at Yale and moved to New York after enrolling as a PhD student at the University of Columbia. She is mostly renowned for her book called \"Memoirs of a stranger\" which she published while being a Masters student. Her book consists of data she gathered through qualitative methods while she was traveling during summer holidays since she was 19. She travelled to more than 20 countries where she talked to citizens and noted her memories. Many Sociology and some Psychology scholars are using the book as an extracurricular reading. Catherine stopped reading for a while and started bringing up every little detail about the night when she met Alexandra. No wonder she was so pushy and cheeky. Apparently, she thinks too much about herself. What about the accent? Catherine continued to read. Alexandra was born to Jewish parents in St. Petersburg, Russia. She is 26 and spent most of her life in St. Petersburg before moving to the USA at the age of 17 to get education at Yale. Oh, that is where the accent comes from; Catherine said loudly and continued reading. She speaks five languages fluently. OK, Catherine simpered to herself, an all-knowing snob. Then she looked at some of the scientific articles Alexandra wrote and it hit her right away. Yes, the name Slonim was a familiar one. Catherine read an article by her where the author claimed that every single psychological trait was driven by the society we live in or the people surrounding us. Moreover, Catherine used the same article as a resource for her article \"Reversal of self-denial\" and put Alexandra on the reference list. She tried to remind herself the details of the article and thought that in general it was great though there were a few questions in her mind. She could not have imagined that someone so young wrote the article. She returned to her email box. There was nothing important, so she turned it off and went to bed. The next morning, she greeted an old fellow professor while opening her office door with the key. The professor, whose name she tried to recall came close to her asking about her well-being. - Catherine, darling, hope you feel better. We all were worried about you the other day. Is everything OK? Luckily, Catherine just remembered her name. - Professor Smith, so nice of you to ask. Yes, I feel better. I was so tired and exhausted that I went home and had a rest. - I understand. In fact, we were talking about you and mentioned how hard you work since you came here. You might be young and full of energy but it does not mean you should not rest. Give yourself a nice rest occasionally. - Well, I learned my lesson. Next time I will definitely be careful with that. - We will have a lunch with some of the department professors in the cafeteria. Would you like to join us? - Sure, I will join. I will be there at 12pm exactly. - Good. See you at lunch. Catherine did not want to go for a lunch with a group but she did not want to estrange herself from other staff members too. Therefore, she was in the cafeteria right at 12pm. After a group of a few professors sat down at the table. They started talking lively. At first, they talked about how they all hate finals week due to lots of pressure and students coming to their offices and asking for help. Suddenly, Professor McKay turned to Catherine. - Professor Stark, how do you handle students coming to your office and asking for help? I am sleeping with them, Catherine said in her mind. - Professor McKay, it depends on the student. If this is a student who really tried the whole semester but somehow could not succeed, I will do my best to help him or her. However, if this is someone who does not bother himself to come to the class without an excuse, sleep during classes or does not listen to lectures, then I cannot help but pray for that student. Everyone at the table laughed. Professor Smith asked Catherine. - So, how do you like our university? Are you getting used to the new atmosphere or is it uncomfortable? - I am getting used to it slowly. It is a bit difficult though. You know, I lived in a small town and I moved to New York. Everything here is new and enormous. Sometimes I like it but sometimes I find it too much. - You will definitely like it here. I do not know why a young and energetic woman like you would work in Indiana. Here you will have more opportunities for yourself. By the way, students say only great things about you. They seem to enjoy your classes very much. Catherine shyly smiled at Professor Smith's compliment. The other staff members complimented her also bringing up her dedication and hard work she presented while working at the university. Catherine was getting her self-confidence back. It was great to be surrounded by the professors who respected and treated her well. They started discussing other topics like courses and curriculums. One of the professors mentioned about possibility of a new member joining staff. Janette who was sitting next to Catherine and who was the same age as she was, spelled out: - So, is this true? Professor Walters wants her to join us. Another professor, replied while still chewing his bite: - Apparently, he does. It would definitely be great to have her around us. The interest for the department will definitely increase. In addition, everyone likes her courses at the other department. - Oh, come on Professor Barnes. You say that because you like her book and you will be please to work by her side. I like her writings too but I am annoyed that Professor Walters wants to invite someone else to the department when every single one of us can teach the course. Right, Professor Smith? - I agree with you, Janette. Everyone in the department can teach that course. Janette looked at Professor Barnes with a satisfied and happy face. Professor Smith, on the other hand, continued talking: - Nevertheless, Janette, dear, I should also admit that practically she is the only one to use the knowledge of qualitative research methods in real life situation until now. I find her works a little progressive but it is quite impressive as well. She has quite a potential and if she uses that potential in the right direction, I think she will be the next Bourdieu or Durkheim of her period. Catherine could not help but interfere: - Sorry, I am lost. Who are you all talking about? Alexandra Slomin, Janette responded quickly both with spark in her eyes and annoyance in her voice.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 When their lips finally met, Catherine squeezed her already folded arms around Jackie. Why did she even let her go? She pushed Jackie towards the bed and lay on top of her. While opening the buttons of her shirt, she looked into Jackie's eyes and said, \"I missed you... a lot\". In the morning, while grabbing a coffee on the way to her office she thought about the last night's dream. It was surreal but at the same time so realistic. It would be like this if she ever will come across Jackie again. She really missed her. Although she never deleted her phone number, she did not want to get in touch with her. While going through mails in her office, Catherine saw an invitation to an event organized by the NYU College of Arts and Science. Apparently, all department staff was invited. \"OK, this will be great to have a change of scenery.\"- She thought to herself. It was an annual gathering of academicians of Arts and Science College. Catherine sat at the table separated for Psychology Department staff. The sound of murmuring spread across the hall. Dean of College made an opening with a warm speech and went through a few changes regarding rules and regulations at the university. As soon as she finished her talk, everyone around started move chaotically. Psychology staff began talking to professors from other departments. Catherine just had a sip of her wine when professor Walters approached her. - Professor Stark, do you enjoy the evening? - Good evening, Professor Walters. I am not so sure. The evening just started. Will see. - I have to say, I have heard nothing but only good things about you. Both students and teaching staff seems to like you a lot. - Thank you, Professor Walters. I appreciate your compliments. I hope not to let your expectations down. - Well, do not forget to communicate with other department staff members. You will meet many interesting people. Let me start by introducing you to one of them. He grabbed someone passing by. -Alexandra, can I have your minute? Please let me introduce you to our newest staff member. Catherine saw a surprised look on Alexandra's face. She definitely did not expect this. - No need, Professor Walters. We have already met. Professor Stark is a member of midnight library visitors club. She flashed an innocent smile at Catherine and Catherine responded the same way. Professor Walters acknowledged his mission to be done and left. After he left, Alexandra looked at Catherine, maybe with a hope that she might start the talk. Catherine did not know where to start. - Did you pass my greetings to your dog? - No, I forgot. - Catherine laughed at the sudden comment. - How are you? - Fine. You? - I am OK, although a little bit bored. These kind of places are not for me. - I agree. You are too young for it. Your generation prefers to do fun stuff. - My generation? - exclaimed Alexandra with wondering eyes. - What do you call fun stuff? - How should I know? I have passed that phase long ago. - A-hah! Then what was fun stuff for your generation? - Most of what we liked back then is illegal these days. Apparently, this fact amused Alexandra a lot. As she opened her mouth to say something, two professors approached her immediately and drag her into a conversation. Catherine, who was left aside, slowly left the spot. When she turned back to see whether there is anyone left around from the department, she caught Alexandra's glance on herself. Apparently, she was trapped in the conversation she would definitely like to avoid. Luckily, Catherine find Janette and they started talking. - I saw you talking to Slonim. Do you know her? - Yes, I have met her once in the library. We exchanged a few sentences. - So, what is she like? People who know her talk great things about her. Catherine felt a sudden change in Janette's demeanor. Before, she was annoyed by the fact that Alexandra might teach a course at the Psychology department, now she acted like a teenage fangirl. - I do not know. We have not talk so much. She seems to me a little bit arrogant but it might be my imagination. - I do not like the idea of her being aboard. It feels like underestimation of our teaching abilities. However, she is great at what she does. Did you read her book? - No, I did not. - You should. While traveling she interviewed many strangers and noted down everything she heard. Then she analyzed the collected data and made research on relevant literature. This is how her book emerged. She even uses some psychology approaches. Apparently, she is more into Social Psychology. - I will read the book. Being only one around who did not read it sucks. Later, a few professors joined them, and after some time, Catherine excused herself to go to lavatory. Once she opened the door, she saw a woman who pressed her back to the wall and bent over her smartphone. She wore a slinky black dress. Catherine recognized Alexandra who did not even bothered to raise her head. Probably, she was hiding here. - Are you hiding here? Alexandra raised her head and looked at her. Catherine saw her grinning. -Yes. The crowd there is terrible. - They bother you? - They are boring. It is killing me. - Why did you come here then? - I have missed a few events like this and I could not say no again. I am out of excuses. Catherine smiled at her empathetically. She knew how Jackie hated crowds where she was constantly harassed by question asking strangers. Probably, it is the same with Alexandra. - You know there are rumors in our department. They say you will teach one of our courses. Is that the reason why you were sure about us meeting again? - Yes, I got an offer like that and I would like to accept it. I told professor Walters that might not be the best idea. Probably, Psychology staff hates it, right? - No problem with me. I would not teach the course anyway. I hated qualitative researches a lot. Too much disorganization for me. - So, what you like is abnormal stuff. That is so organized. – Alexandra teased. Catherine looked at her curiously. Alexandra had a satisfied look on her face. - I researched about you a little bit. Read your latest article. Liked it a lot by the way. Especially was surprised to see my name on the reference list. - I did not know it was you. I realized it later. - You know, in case you will be interested, I will be happy to invite you for a coffee to discuss your article. Just let me know when you have free time. She took a business card from her purse. Catherine thanked her before taking the card. Alexandra said she is going to leave. -See you, Professor Stark. Hope at least you will enjoy this evening. -Thanks. I will try. Catherine saw another dream that night and it caught her by surprise.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 In her office, Catherine was directly looking at her desk. The business card Alexandra gave her was laying on it. Catherine stretched her hand to take the card but put her hand down without even touching it. What happened the last night, was not supposed to happen. It was beyond a coincidence. Since she is a psychologist, Catherine knew that every dream that we see is a link to our subconscious mind. We see the dreams that are connected to our desires, fears, etc. This fact startled her. She would never imagine it in real life. Why would she even dream about it? She exactly remembers how Jackie laid on top of her; her tongue pressed against Catherine's and her hands on Catherine's breasts. Since when she is on top, thought Catherine to herself. She immediately turned over with Jackie, so she could be on top of her. To her horror, she was looking at Alexandra's face. Alexandra was the one laying under her, not Jackie. As if it was not enough, she said, \"Are you going to do it or not?\" Then she woke up and could not ignore the dream whole day. What was happening? She felt like she betrayed Jackie, cheated on her. Well, she cheated on her long before, when she slept with Michael to make Jackie feel bad... What the hell she was thinking... But sleeping with another woman in her dream was cheating on her mentally. And why Alexandra? There is nothing likable about her. Yes, she is attractive, she is smart and she seemed nice during their last talk but she was nothing like Jackie or anyone else she slept with. She is too self-directed and self-esteemed for Catherine. Catherine liked people who were week and lost. That way it was easier for Catherine to hunt them as a predator. Alexandra is not like that. She probably is a hunter herself. What made it even worse was the business card Alexandra gave her. She definitely was interested in meeting her but Catherine was not sure about it. Especially after that dream. Now sitting at her desk Catherine observed the card with Alexandra's name and contact information. Maybe she should give her a call and arrange a meeting for next week. She cannot meet her right now due to recent dream confusions. Therefore, she would better meet her a week later. That way, she will calm down and be more relaxed. She dialed the number, pressed call and waited for Alexandra to respond. She waited long enough to put down the phone. Once she wanted to do that, she heard someone answering to the call and saying, \"Hello\". Catherine froze. She did not know how to start the talk. - Hello? - Hi, it is Catherine. - Professor Stark! Such a pleasant surprise. - Well, you were the one to give me your card. - Well, you had the option not to call. - I did not want to be rude. - Thank you in any case. How was the rest of the night? - Let's say, you were smart enough to leave. Timing was ideal. So, are you willing to discuss academic issues? - We will discuss work only? - Yes... Until you would like to discuss something else? - No, I mean it is great to meet and discuss our inquiries. - OK. \"She didn't believe it. Why the hell would I say that?\", Catherine said herself. She decided to change the topic. So, she asked: - Do you have a place in your mind? - Actually, there this little coffee shop in the crossover of W 3rd St. and Sullivan St. I like it a lot. Coffee is great there. - OK. Wednesday, next week at 5:00pm? - Next week? - Yes. This is a tough week for me. The next week right before exams would be perfect. - OK then. I confirm the date and time. See you then. - See you too. On Wednesday at 5pm, Catherine entered to the coffee shop. There were not so many people. She saw a woman in a red sweater sitting at one of the estranging tables. She was reading a book. Catherine looked at her carefully to be sure its Alexandra and then moved towards her. - Hi. The familiar face glanced up at her. Seeing her face and remembering her dream, Catherine felt uneasy.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 - Professor Stark? Are you OK? - … I am sorry. I am a bit tired and there is something else in my mind… Hi. Catherine smiled. Alexandra look at her like she was scanning her to understand what is in her mind. - If you had rough a day, maybe we should postpone the meeting to some other day, until you feel better. - No, no. It is OK. - Then let us order coffee. What would you like? They made their orders and sat down sipping their coffees. Catherine rushed to start the conversation not to look suspicious. - This is a nice place. Are you a regular here? - Yes, I am. I usually buy coffee here and take it with me. On rare occasions, when I have meetings like this, I invite people here. - Isn't it hard to have a take away coffee with yourself on a motorcycle? Alexandra laughed. - I am not sure. I think it might be. I have never tried it before. - Aa… You walk after buying coffee, right. - Sometimes yes but most of the time I buy coffee and drive to a class. I also have a car. You see, I had a motorcycle, you might call it a phase, and I could not sell it because of too many memories. Therefore, I still own it and drive on it sometimes. - What kind of memories? Catherine asked immediately without thinking. - I prefer to hush about it. It is very personal. - I am sorry. It is none of my business anyway. - It is OK. Human nature is curious. For example, I am curious about why a brilliant Stanford alumnus would move to Indiana. - I did not know what I wanted back then. I was very young, younger than you are. I owned a house in Indiana so I thought it would be easier to move to Indiana rather to another city. - You probably disliked it there if you moved to New York. - I got bored. Therefore, I left. - Boredom is the reason why we all change the course of our lives. Hope this change would be great for you. - Thank you. May I ask, was boredom a reason for you to leave your home country? Alexandra looked at Catherine with a curious and a smiling face. - I also did my homework. Catherine smiled. - It was not boredom. It was a dream. - Dream? - Yes. For me, the US was always a magical land with lots of opportunities and interesting lifestyle. It might be banal but I was born in Reagan era and TV helped a lot to shape my mind. - Apparently, TV is not so useless if it helped you become what you are now. - It is not so simple. I loved watching TV and playing on game console. Nevertheless, there was a problem. My mother was a typical Jewish mother. In the US, they call mothers like her as a tiger mother. Since the first day I was born, all the plans and schedules regarding my life were designed. Besides standard school hours, I had to visit music school where I learned to play piano, a tutor who taught me English and German, and a tennis coach with whom I practiced three times a week. Moreover, I had to finish reading at least two classical literature books per months. Only if I could accomplish all the tasks, my mother would let me watch TV. - Wow. That is impressive but at the same time awful. For a child. - That is how I decided to leave Russia, to get rid of my mother's attention. It was not due to boredom. I never had time to be bored. Besides all the difficulties of my childhood, I love St. Petersburg. It is a beautiful city and have great museums. - I understand. Catherine started to think that after all, both Jackie and Alexandra were alike. Apparently, they both had problems getting along with their mothers and both disliked crowds. She wondered whether there were other similarities. - Probably, you love the USA since you did not leave after the graduation. - I like the US though I had lots of disappointments. - What kind of disappointments? - I told you before coming here I thought of the US as a magical land with abundance of opportunities and freedom. I was right about those but everything comes within its price. As Ginsberg said, \"America I've given you all and now I'm nothing.\" - You underestimate yourself, I think. Everyone around is sure that you will be greatest scholar in the field of Sociology. - Everyone might be sure but they do not know what it is in my head. - What is it in your head? Alexandra fell silent and looked at Catherine. - I am sorry. Again, it is not my business. May I ask, why Sociology? Alexandra thought a bit, smiled sadly and continued; - My mother hated the idea of me studying social sciences. She wanted me to be surgeon or an engineer at least. I even applied to a Medical faculty in Germany to please her and was admitted. My obsession was social sciences. Since I was a teenager, I read books by Camus and Kafka. I was interested in how the world around us works. How societies we live in make us who we are although we think that we are distinct and only we decide on who we are or what we want. That is how I applied for Sociology. - Did it help you to find answers to your questions? - Partially. I still look for answers. Alexandra smiled sadly again. - Enough about me. How did you decide to go on with Psychology? Although curiosity? - Nope. Mine was a planned action. My parents were psychologists. I was surrounded by psychology since childhood and it went like it. - Is this where did you get the idea to write about Reversal of Self-denial ? - Well, if you have seen it before and you probably have seen it. Some people who would not react silently on certain actions, reactions or talks in a normal situation, would do so in a situation where they are not allowed to do so. For examples, students laughing during the class… - I understand the reasons why you wrote about it. You did not answer where did you get the idea. - It is personal. Alexandra looked at her and blurted out: - Oh my god! It is something related to sex, isn't it? She nickered like a teenager whereas Catherine was lost. She hissed at her. - Why would you think so? - The way you smirked and blushed at the same time gave you away. - Don't you think it is inappropriate to make this conversation with someone you barely know? - I'm really sorry but please put yourself into my shoes. If it would be you, you'd also find it amusing. Catherine looked at her and imagined how she would feel. She'd probably laugh at it but would not throw it into someone's face. Overall, Catherine did not feel angry with Alexandra. She discovered a new side of her she did not observed before. She is still a child deep in her heard. At this moment, Catherine considered her being adorable. - OK. Stop it. I feel ridiculous right now. - I am sorry. I really should not have laughed but this is funny as hell. Alexandra calmed down and looked at Catherine with innocent eyes of a child who behaved herself bad. Catherine did not know how to support the talk. - Do you feel OK now? Happy? - I am sorry Professor Stark. - You know, I really thought you are a mature person though you are young. - Hey, stop throwing it in my face. You are older than me for 6-7 years. You are not so old. - 8 years, actually. - Whatever. Plus, we all have immaturity deep in our souls. - If you are done with your teasing, I would like to go on with discussion of the article. - OK. I liked your article. But I hate the part where you analyze and destroy my assumptions. - Your assumptions are good but you are so sure that every behavior we have is shaped by society that you do not have a space other alternatives. - You think our consciousness is not shaped by the society? - Of course not, if it were like that there would not be psychology. - Psychology is there to understand what happens to people after they are being under influence of the society. You see the way I see it is we come to the world as authentic human beings. The society we live in kills all the authenticity in us. You, I or anyone else can say we are different. We are distinct. However, we are not. We are all alike accordingly with the community we belong to. There are only a few people on earth who might be different and the reason for them to be different is them rebelling against already established regulations and ethics. - You think you are not distinct? - No, I am not. I do not have guts to rebel. - And you think psychology is there to assist sociology? - Not at all. Psychology is there to understand how people react to all the limitations put on them. People's reaction and perception are different. Therefore, some might get those limitations normal whereas some might fell in depression. Some might get suicidal but some might look for help. For example, have you ever read Emile Durkheim's Suicide ? He analyzed the suicide rates in the late 19th century France and … Catherine listened to Alexandra carefully. She was well read, smart and self-confident. Those qualities were making her more attractive. Catherine also observed one interesting fact about her. It was so easy and interesting to communicate with her. - I have this feeling that my talking bores you. - No, not at all. On the contrary, you talk so easy and informative that I wondered about your lectures. - You are always welcomed to see me during the classes. - I should spare time and pay a visit to one of your courses. - The next semester will start soon. You can visit me then. Plus, it will be easier for you. - I will definitely do that. They continued talking about the classes they teach and which scholars they prefer to include in reading list. In the evening, when Catherine just came home from her meeting she received a text message, \"It was great talking to you. Should do it sometime again. Alexandra\" Catherine smiled and responded, \" Definitely. Thank you for the coffee. Goodnight.\". \"Goodnight, Professor Stark\". After checking on Ethan and changing her closes, Catherine lay down on her bed. Thinking about her life in New York, her job, Jackie and then Alexandra. She thought about everything happening in her life until both her eyes closed.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Finals period passed quickly for Catherine. The only thing left was evaluating exam papers. She had a brief rest before that, a weekend. Catherine made all the necessary shopping before weekend to spend time with Ethan. She decided to spend the whole weekend on the sofa watching movies. Ethan laid right next to her watching her with sad eyes. He did not get used to New York and Catherine was powerless to cheer him up. The only thing Catherine could do was petting his head while he laid their motionless. On Saturday night, Catherine was still trying hard to cheer Ethan when an erotic scene emerged on the TV. Catherine just glanced up and then realized that she cannot take her eyes away. She was so much turned on that she desired to have someone by her side right. It does not matter whom, she would have sex with that person right away. It was not only about sex. She missed being kissed, touched and hugged. She felt estranged from everyone. She has always been lonely. Yet she always had someone nearby to calm her urges. The last time she had sex was the last time she saw Jackie. It has been more than two years but since then she could not let anyone near her. Now she lived in New York and barely knew anyone who she can have sex with. She was specifically interested in sex, not a relationship. All her life she stayed away from being in a relationship and right now when she started rebuilding her life from scratch, she did not need a relationship to held more responsibilities. She thought about the possible solutions. She thought of a one-night stand. But where? She decided to go to a bar to have a few drinks and meet someone. She checked in internet about the nearest bars. She chose a bar on Cooper Square. An hour and a half later, Catherine was standing at the bar desk. She ordered a scotch on rocks. Once she got her order, she drank off her drink immediately. She was nervous. She'd better relax. Therefore, she asked for repetition. This time she was sipping slowly. An hour later, she was still standing lonely observing people. A few people made move on her but she ignored them all. She was waiting for someone but she did not know whom she was waiting for. She took out her smartphone and started writing a SMS: \"Are you a drinker?\" She pushed send. She continued watching around. She saw a few good looking girls but they did not even look at her. Of course, Catherine knew it was a straight bar. She wanted to meet women she needed to go to a gay bar. But it was not about girls either. She was waiting for someone. Who? She still did not know. Just she thought about leaving, she received an SMS: \"Whenever it is needed. Inviting me for a drink?\" Catherine typed: \"It is a bar on crossroads of Cooper square and 3rd str.\" Pushed send. A few seconds later, she received a response: \"Stay there. I'm on my way.\" She spent half an hour waiting for her invitee. Suddenly she felt someone's hand on her back. She turned around and saw a young brunette with blue eyes looking at her excitingly. - Hi. - Hey. - Relaxing? - Trying. Would you like something? My treat. Alexandra looked at Catherine with interest. - How many did you have already? - This is the third. What do you want? Vodka? - Come on, Professor Stark. Stereotypes? Please don't. She turned to barman, \"I'll have whatever the lady has\", and she pointed at Catherine with her head. - Lady? - You mind? - Of course, I do. I said I am older than you but not that much. Catherine laughed. She felt alcohol taking advantage of her. Alexandra probably sensed it and looked at her with a satisfied look on her face. - You know Professor Stark, I have this feeling that I will love your drunken state. - Don't get used to it. It happens rarely. - If you say so, Professor Stark. - By the way, my first name is Catherine. - I know. - I mean, you can call me, Catherine. - Catherine. Alexandra smiled. When scotch on rocks arrived, she touched Catherine's glass with hers and made a sip. Catherine felt her to come closer to her. She felt their elbows touch. - So Catherine. Why are you here? Why are you drinking? - Felt tired. Needed to relax. Alexandra turned her face to Catherine and looked at her carefully. She drank her scotch at one gulp and ordered one more. Catherine also asked for one more glass. - You look great. Make up and the way you are dressed says you had been waiting for your date but got ditched at the last minute. Catherine did not respond. - OK. I will not push you. Would you like to talk about something else? - Do you date anyone? Catherine blurted and thought over what she just said. She should not have done that. -No. -I'm sorry. It is just... A very personal question. I should not have asked. Actually, Catherine was not. She was happy to know that Alexandra was single. While Catherine celebrated, she also felt Alexandra to come a little bit closer. Now she almost felt her breath on her lips. Alexandra looked at her tenderly and asked: -Do you have anyone? Catherine shook her head. It seemed like music in the background played louder. Alcohol was kicking in strong. She felt Alexandra's hand on her waist. Her hand started to go up to Catherine's back and her lips were surmounting the last distance. Their lips touched. It was a soft kiss with mutual tender moves of lips. When they stopped kissing, Alexandra turned to barman to take their order. Catherine, on the other hand, was quiet and shocked at the same time. She drank a bit of her scotch to feel encouraged. She looked at Alexandra who slowly was drinking her scotch and thinking about something. Catherine was curious about what Alexandra thinks. Alexandra's hand still on her waist, she felt the hand pulling her closer to herself. Alexandra turned to Catherine and asked: -You OK? Catherine did not say anything but nodded. Alexandra put her lips on her cheek still holding her arm nicely squeezing her waist. They were very close and hold on to each other. If someone will see them like this, they would probably think they are dating. Catherine put her head on Alexandra's shoulder. Alexandra looked at her with a brief smile on her face before Catherine kissed her grabbing her face. This time the kiss was very passionate. Catherine felt Alexandra's tongue in her mouth. She knew she wanted more. She woke up immediately. She was thankful that it is a dream. It was another nightmare. Her headache made her feel powerless. She rubbed the temples of her head and then realized two things. First, she did not recognize her bedroom. Second, she felt she is naked. She closed her eyes for a minute to be sure that it is not a dream. Then she opened her eyes and turned around. She saw a woman lying next to her. She slept in an embryo position. Catherine could not see her face. However, the woman's dark hair was enough to understand who she was.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 Catherine was astonished. She stayed in the same position long enough to look at sleeping Alexandra and be assured that this is real. She looked around the room and saw her clothes lay on the floor. Without thinking what will be her next action, she got up and started to collect her belongings. She slowly dressed up. Then she realized that her underwear is missing. She looked around carefully but could not find it. In order to leave without waking up Alexandra, because she does not know how to behave with her, she decided to leave immediately. Once she was outside, she caught a taxi. On the way home, she tried to remember what happened to her but she could not remember what happened after the second kiss. At home, she had a shower. Then she poured herself a cup of coffee and sat down to remember what happened last night. She definitely remembered the both kisses. She forced herself to remember the last night and she recalled leaving the bar with Alexandra to commute to her apartment. She remembered only a few things but most of them were blurry. She also remembered Alexandra holding her while they walked out of the bar. She enlightened, another scene came to her mind. She laid on the bed naked with Alexandra on top of her. The latter reclined to bed with her right arm, her fingers stroking Catherine's hair. Her left arm was below, she was caressing Catherine's left inner thigh with the tips of her fingers while kissing her neck. Her fingertips were trailing their path up... Catherine stood up. Remembering that scene turned her on. On one hand, she was satisfied. On the other hand, she was angry with herself. She threw herself on the couch. Laying on her back and looking at the ceiling, she felt her eyes filling with tears. She supposed to start a new life but she blew it off. She already slept with a colleague. Things will definitely be strange from now on. Especially, after Alexandra will start teaching in the Psychology department. How will she face her? How she will explain to her that their night together supposed to be a one-night stand. Maybe, Catherine thought for a moment, maybe Alexandra was also looking for a fling, one meaningless sex. After all, she did not look like relationship material or someone with strong intentions. Yes, probably Alexandra will forget about this until their next meeting. Just Catherine thought about it, she received a text message. \"Cherchez la femme.\" It was Alexandra. Catherine did not expect it. She typed and sent, \"what does it mean?\" A few minutes later she received a response, \"It means, look for the woman. Why did you leave so early?\" Catherine did not know what to answer. She did not even want to answer. Therefore, she ignored the SMS. She believed that way she will get rid of Alexandra's attention. Close to the evening, her phone started ringing. Alexandra was calling her. Catherine waited a bit. She was analyzing the situation. She will not be able to ignore her all the time. She will face her eventually so she answered and heard a quite serious tone on the line. -How are you, Catherine? -I am OK. -Good. Why did you leave without waking me up? -Look, I am not feeling well to have this conversation. Let us meet at your favorite coffee place tomorrow and talk. Is it OK? -Sure. 5pm? -That sounds good. The next day, Catherine was getting ready to go to work. She wore her blouse with a wide and deep cut and checked herself in the mirror before leaving. That is when she discovered a violet mark spot right on top of her heart. She touched it and discovered that it is a hickey. She went to her bedroom to change her top. Catherine paid a visit to her office to read final papers and grade them. Close to 5 pm, she started feeling nervous. She wished not to have this meeting but she could not cancel it on a last minute call. It will look rude and Alexandra does not deserve that. She decided to go to the coffee shop earlier, have a coffee and think about how she is going to handle the conversation. While reorganizing her speech holding to her coffee cup with both hands, she heard the door to open and someone to enter. She was not willing to hold her head up. -Did you start without me? The familiar voice almost echoed. She did not want to look at her face. -Are we going to talk like normal people at all? Catherine looked at her. Alexandra was smiling. -Do you want something? I will get myself something before sitting down. -No. -OK then. After sitting down with her coffee, Alexandra looked at Catherine with warm in her eyes. -I do not know how to greet you, to tell the truth. I do not know whether I should kiss you on the cheek, hug you or just say \"hello\". -I would be happy if you could help me to recall the last night. -You were drunk. I was not that drunk but I was not sober either. After exchanging a few sentences we made out at the bar table. Then... She stopped, looked at Catherine and grinned. -Well, you know the rest. -Is there a little chance we did not do it? -Catherine, if a woman goes into my bed naked, we always do it. Catherine hid her face in both her hand palms. -What I understand is you regret it. Catherine raised her head -Look, you are great. Beautiful and interesting. However, there is a problem. The reason why I was in that bar yesterday is I needed to find someone for a one-night stand. I am trying to get over someone. -Why did you text me? -I could not find anyone in the bar. Alexandra looked at her curiously. -Alexandra, I am sorry. Really, I am. It is just, I am getting over this person and I do not look for something serious. I do not want to hurt you but please let us try to forget the last night. Alexandra looked at Catherine with a stern face. Catherine got scared that she might make a scene out of this. She waited for Alexandra's response impatiently. Alexandra did not wait long before answering. -I want to understand one thing. Why would you think that I might perceive the last night as a hint for a serious stuff? Catherine silently looked at her asking for more clarification. -Look, if I want to have a relationship with a woman, I do not jump at her at the first chance. Besides, of all, I am also getting over someone. Frankly, the last night I wanted to blow some steam. Catherine did not believe in what she just heard. It is going to be easy to forget about that. There will be no problems. -Are you OK with it? -Yes, Catherine. Catherine felt relief. She instantly became cheerful. A beautiful smile emerged on her face. -You felt better. I am glad about that. -I am sorry. I thought it will be uncomfortable but now I feel relaxed. How are you, by the way? -Good, thanks. -I hope we can remain friendly. -Of course. Alexandra smiled. -But there is one thing that bothers me. What am I supposes to do with your underwear you left at my place? Catherine's eyes widened. She looked directly at Alexandra. Alexandra, on the other hand, looked very calm. Then she burst into laughter. She laughed like an innocent child, from her heart and a lot. Catherine watched her with an open mouse and wide eyes. -Sorry, Catherine. But I should get the best of it. This is the price you pay for sleeping with me. I am going to tease you a lot. Catherine closed her eyes for a bit and said to her: -You are like a high schooler. I really thought you are mature. -Oh, come on. You are going to love it. I should get going, Catherine. I should get my luggage ready. -Are you going somewhere? -Yes, I decided to visit Italy and France before the semester starts. -Business trip? -No, leisure. -Have a safe flight and trip then. -Thanks. See you at the department. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, btw. -Thanks, you too. Catherine smiled. Alexandra got up, came closer and kissed her on the right cheek. -Bye, Catherine. Then she moved to the door with quick and determined steps. Catherine looked at her from behind. She did not like her to leave but she could not do anything about it.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 Catherine spent holidays alone in the company of Ethan. It was not unusual. This was something she got used to. This was her comfort zone. She was waiting impatiently for the classes to start. That way she would return to her normal course of life. Staying at home was very boring. She felt miserable. She wished to have someone who she can meet. One day, she decided to take Ethan for a walk to Chelsea. It was an unusual route for them but Catherine wanted to discover new locations. They were walking on the street and looking at little shops situated on the street. She bought a few accessories for her apartment. Then she walked with Ethan until she spotted a bookstore with a coffee bar. She went in, ordered a coffee and bought a cookie, which she immediately gave to Ethan. Ethan wagged his tail, which indicated that he was happy to have it. Catherine laughed looking at him. She put her bags on a chair at a table in the corner. While her order was getting ready, she looked through shelves to see whether there is something interesting. Barista called her name and she turned at him. Then something made her turn again to the shelf she was looking before she turned. She saw a book with a white cover and a photo on the cover. In the photo, there was a motorcycle and mountains in the background. Below the picture, she read \"Memoirs of a Stranger\" \"a series of notes by Alexandra Slonim\". Without thinking much, Catherine took the book and her order and sat down. She looked at the book cover long enough. She opened the book. At the first page in italic, there was a writing: \"To an incredible woman who shared every single precious moment with me, Cecile\". Catherine felt a little bit saltiness in her stomach. She felt jealous. There was a woman who shared incredible moments with Alexandra. Probably, this is the woman she is getting over. Catherine felt angry with herself. Why the hell would she feel jealous? They had one meaningless night together. That is it and there will be nothing like that anymore. However, she continued to feel jealous. She could not help it. Over the people who she dated in the past, never ever someone dedicated anything to her. She started scanning the pages of the book. There were interesting photos and Alexandra took all of them. Apparently, she was a photographer. Her photos were great, deep and meaningful. Catherine started to recall her talks with Alexandra. She never thought of her as someone artistic. To Catherine she was more adventurous and wild type rather than someone who would write a book and shoot photos. One photo especially caught her attention. It was taken in a village in Sicily. Two women were kissing while sitting at the table in a cafe. A group of old and conservatively dressed men passing by cafe stared at them. She drank some of her coffee and continued to read the book. The book was an easy read book. Alexandra shared her memories and stories she encountered while traveling and used well-known scholars to support her hypothesis or to ruin theirs. Catherine bought the book on her way out of the bookstore. The next few days, before classes started, she finished reading the book. Catherine was curious about Alexandra more than ever. She looked forward to seeing her again because she discovered the other side of Alexandra she never sensed before. Now she felt Alexandra being more philosophical, artistic and romantic. She felt Alexandra being a kind of person she would always feel great to spend time. She really hoped they could be friends. If only she could go back in time and prevent herself from sleeping with Alexandra. She tried to remember their night together but she could not remember everything. However, the night was what she needed for herself. Alexandra was an experienced lover. She is not a type who has many girlfriends. The last time they talked, she said she is getting over someone. Probably, it is the girl she mentioned in her book. \"Why did they break up?\" Catherine wondered. On the first day of the academic semester, Catherine rushed to the school. She could not tell whether it was due to her impatience about teaching or her desire to see Alexandra. She had two classes, which she ended quickly since they were introductory. She was wondering around department building to meet staff members. She met Janette and Smith. They were discussing the semester. -How are you, dear? Professor Smith asked. Catherine told her she is OK and asked about their well-being. Then she told them about the courses she is going to teach. They were talking about their winter break and families, which made Catherine uncomfortable. Smith sensed that and tried to change the subject to something else whereas Janette was very persistent. She turned to Catherine: -You are so beautiful. I cannot believe you are still single. Catherine responded with a brief smile that almost meant, \"Stop it. Don't go further\". Nevertheless, Janette preferred to go on. She blabbered about how Catherine should invest more time in her personal life because one day it will be too late and she will regret it. Professor Smith, a woman in her mid-50s, felt emphatic for Catherine and interfered. -Janette, dear, I think we should let everyone to have their personal space, right? -Of course. Catherine, I hope I did not hurt you in any way. It is just… I wanted to help. -It is OK. I get that a lot. Catherine smiled though she did not mean it. Then she excused herself and left them. When she was walking away, she heard Janette asking Smith, \"Slonim is not back, right?\" The same evening, at home, Catherine thought about the encounter with Janette. It was not the first time someone tried to teach her about taking care of her personal life. She had that back in Bloomington. Teaching stuff and people she would meet at various events would try to introduce her to potential candidates for marriage. Usually, they would try to introduce her to someone handsome from the middle class. Therefore, she was popular among her same ages from opposite sex. Although she always received requests for a date, she always rejected. Only once, she decided to go forward in order to repel Jackie from herself and invited one of them over to her house. Michael was always interested in Catherine, so when she invited him over he did not hesitate a second. Once they were upstairs, Catherine could not get rid of him since she was the one to bring him all the way up there. Besides, he saw Jackie and she did not want to grow suspicions. She slept with him to calm him down. During sex, she did not feel anything but was disgusted by herself in the morning. Now sitting on her couch, she remembered the details of that night and was once again irked by herself. She would never do that again. The next day she forced herself to go to school. Though she had classes, she did not want to attend them. She was not sure whether it was due to Janette's talk or Alexandra's absence. When she checked her email box, she saw a reminder about department meeting after classes. She finished her classes and decided to wait until the last moment to go to the meeting. That way, she will not talk to anyone before the meeting starts. Once the meeting started and professor Walters greeted everyone, the door opened. Catherine looked at that direction. She froze for a short time and then a smile emerged on her face stressing her dimples.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 Catherine could not stop smiling though she knew she might get the attention of other people. Alexandra was standing at the door wearing the same turtleneck sweater, black leather jacket and holding a helmet. Catherine noticed her being a little bit tanned. She still looked beautiful. Professor Walters was happy no less than Catherine. He stood up and greeted Alexandra. Everyone was staring at her. Once Walters sat down and started the meeting, Catherine saw Alexandra to choose a sit at the far corner of the room, away from everyone else. She sat down and put her helmet on her knees. Then she looked up and caught Catherine's sight on herself. They smiled at each other. The meeting was long and Catherine wanted it to end as quickly as possible, so she could talk to Alexandra. Nevertheless, as it happens in such situations, time almost stopped, and not in a good way. After an hour and a half, Walters stood up. Thanked everyone and asked Alexandra aloud: -Professor Slonim, would you like to add something? You were quiet today. Alexandra looked unhappy. Apparently, she did not want to talk in front all these people. She stood up and said with a calm and shy tone of voice. -First of all, I would like to thank you, Professor Walters, for letting me join your department. Secondly, I hope this semester will be great for all of the students, and us of course. At last, I am happy to be here and right now I will make myself busy to warm up to your department, and if I come up with an idea, I will certainly share it with you all. Everyone around nodded, as they are happy with everything she said. People did not leave immediately. They stayed a little bit longer to greet Alexandra and introduce themselves to her. Catherine waited outside, by the door. When almost everyone left, she saw a tall and dark figure leaving the room. Catherine called behind her. -Nice tan. Alexandra turned with a foxy smile. -I think this way it is better. Otherwise, I looked like a vampire. -You look great in whatever way you are. Catherine blurted out. She immediately blushed realizing she should not have said that. Probably, Alexandra understood it. She did not say anything but smiled at her in an adorable manner. -How was your vacation? -Nice. Calm and relaxing. The way I like it. How was your trip? -Great. I was in solitude by the beach. Sun was bright and shiny. Sea was warm and relaxing. Plus, I had a book to read. More than enough for me. -Was it in Italy or France? -Sicily, Italy. -You did not visit France then. -I did. I had to… I mean, I really wanted to. Catherine witnessed a sudden change in Alexandra's demeanor. Suddenly, she became sad and looked like she wanted to end the conversation. Thinking that her trip to France was not so pleasant, she decided to change the subject. - While you were on your trip, I decided to learn more about you. Alexandra smiled cunningly before replying: - Don't you think you should have done it before sleeping with me? Catherine looked right into her eyes and rolled her eyes as if she is bored. Then she laughed and Alexandra joined her. - Though I think jokes of yours are immature, this one was a good one. What I wanted to say was, I bought your book. Quite an interesting material. -You should not have done it. I could give you one. You only needed to mention. -It is not a big deal. Besides, I will need you to sign it. Catherine smiled at Alexandra. Alexandra smiled back, saying: \"With a pleasure\". One they were on parking slot, Catherine looked at the only bike nearby. -Familiar bike. Alexandra smiled. -I can give you a ride sometime. If only you wish. -No, thanks. I am too much of a coward for it. -You never try, you never know. Catherine smiled and said she is glad to see her again. They finalized their talk and parted ways. Catherine in her car looked at the rare mirror the same way she did the first day they met. Alexandra was sitting on her bike and wearing her helmet. Then, suddenly, she turned back and looked at Catherine's car. Catherine waited for a few seconds and then turned on the engine and moved the car.[Chapter 12] The semester became more interesting as Alexandra came back from Europe. Catherine enjoyed going to work each day. She even started having lunches with her colleagues again. She also met Alexandra a few times and they had coffee during breaks. Every time they would drink coffee, they would talk on various issues, which helped Catherine to know Alexandra more. She definitely was the most interesting staff member of the department. Spending time with her was enjoyable. One day, Catherine wanted to invite her for a coffee and decided not to wait until Alexandra finishes her class. She entered the lecture hall from the back door not to catch anyone's attention. This was also her chance to see her during the action. Once she was inside and sat down on the last row seat where only a few students were sitting. She looked at the hall and saw that it was almost full. These many students are certainly too much for just a course. Alexandra had already begun lecturing. Everyone listened to her. -... Of course, it is very difficult to stay objective while you are conducting a qualitative research but you should try to stop occasionally during your conversation in order to remind yourself about your original intentions. Believe me, this is not only about qualitative research. That is why many doctors do not interact with their patients. Have you ever watched Daens? That is a great movie. Not only you will learn more about industrial age but also you will see what happens if you mix your job and feelings. Eventually, you will forget about your aim. The same can be said about the movie called The Last Samurai. If you want to know more about using your skills perfectly to learn more about a culture, please make sure you read Ruth Benedict's the Chrysanthemum and the Sword. Please relax, I will not ask questions about it during exams. Everyone sighed in relief whereas a large smile appeared on Alexandra's face. -You see, I was a student like you and I know about the all curses students make for a teacher. Knowing that I am afraid to give you more material than the ones assigned in our curriculum. These are just to broaden your outlook. As everyone laughed and smiled, Catherine was listening and watching carefully. Alexandra was walking from one side to another. Her body language was perfect. When she was listing movies, books, articles and scholars, she would rush to the board and write on it the names and titles. She was like a walking encyclopedia and she really was passionate about passing her knowledge to other people. The class ended. Alexandra said she could take questions if anyone has one. Some of the students rushed towards her and some started to leave. Catherine sat back in her chair to be more comfortable. Once she relaxed a little bit she heard the students on the other side of the row. -Dude, I told you she is hot. -You are right. I should have listened to you before. Do you think she is dating anyone? -Like if she is not, you are going to try your luck? -Why not? -You idiot... students and teaching staff are not allowed to date. -She is not in this department. -You are such a genius. She is still a teacher at the school. The girl sitting with them interrupted both her friends. -Even if it was allowed, I do not think you would have a luck with her. -And why is that? -Guys, she is way out of your league. I bet she is dating hot, adventurous and smart guys. Catherine listened to them. She wondered whether there was anyone talking about her like that. Once there were a few students left, Catherine came closer to Alexandra. -Hello there. Coffee? -Would be great. Where did you come from? -I was in the back row listening to your lecture. Alexandra looked at her surprised. -Why did you not inform about visiting my class? I could have reserved you a seat in the first rows. -No need. I enjoyed the lecture anyway. You are good at what you do. I was fascinated by your teaching techniques. They started to move and left the lecture hall. -I really thought that you might have difficulties in making students listen to you due to you being young. However, they love listening to you. By the way, are all of those students registered for your course? -No. Only 100 students. I let the other ones just join the lecture if they are so interested. -That is so generous of you. -Well, there is nothing wrong with sharing your experience and knowledge with others. -You are right. Catherine smiled. They were near the cafeteria. Once they got their coffees, Catherine insisted on paying. They sat down on a bench. -Hope you do not mind. Alexandra pulled a cigarette. -If you are OK to poison yourself, why should I care? Alexandra smiled and lit the cigarette. -An interesting thing happened when you finished your lecture. -Don't tell me it was so boring that you cheered once it was finished. Catherine laughed. -No. Not that. A few students were talking about you. I heard them being very affectionate by you. One of them is even interested in pursuing a relationship with you. -Really? Alexandra smiled with a satisfied look on her face. -What can I say? I still got it. -Doesn't it bother you? -Why should it? I am flattered. Would that make you uncomfortable? -Well, yes. Those are students. Catherine sipped her coffee and turned her face in the other direction to avoid looking at Alexandra's face. -Please, Catherine. Do not tell me you are against teacher and student relationship. -Are you not? -Well, I do not say it is right. There should be some boundaries but if it happens, there is not such a big deal about it. Sometimes older and experienced people easily affect young people. I, for example, was in love with my History teacher back at high school. I was so obsessed with her. Once, I saw her leaving the school with her husband. That night, I cried myself to sleep. Catherine looked at Alexandra. She shared this very intimate experience with her. Catherine felt an urge to do the same for the sake of reciprocity but she could not. If Alexandra's sincerity made her look adorable, Catherine's would be worse than that. -I guess you might be right. They smiled at each other and continued to drink their coffees.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 Catherine was rushing to the class. Going through a long hall with students hustling, she was feeling uneasy. At this uncomfortable moment, she saw someone tall moving slowly in front of her and block her way. She wanted to say something could not since she did not see the face of the person. Once she looked at the figure more careful, she realized it to be Alexandra. She rushed to catch her. -Hey! Why are you moving like a turtle? Alexandra looked at her. She was sad. It was as if she did not expect and was upset to see Catherine at that moment. -What is wrong? -Sorry. It is just. She looked at her hands. Catherine saw her holding a camera. It was badly damaged. -Oh. I'm sorry. What happened? -I was driving on my motorcycle and apparently, forgot to zip pocket of my backpack. Alexandra's voice was very down. Catherine never saw her like that. She always looked sharp, witty and charming. Catherine would never believe that Alexandra can be so upset just because of a thing. -I think you can find a master to fix it. -Hardly. It is seriously damaged. Probably it will end up on my bookshelf as a souvenir. -Then you will buy yourself a new one. What is the deal with it? I think you can afford one. -I can. Catherine saw her eyes almost filled with water. -This one was a gift and I have so many memories attached to it. Catherine hushed. She did not know what to say. She walked by Alexandra's side. She wanted to cheer her up but did not know to say or do. -Look, if you are interested, we can go for a drink later. Alexandra looked at her with a strange look on her face. Catherine could not read it. Either Alexandra was confused or disgusted by this offer. -Did you forget what happened the last time we were out to have a drink? Oh, she is confused, Catherine thought to herself in relief. Then she tried to play the way Alexandra always did. -Like you did not like it… Catherine smirked hoping to make Alexandra at least smile. -I liked it. It was you, who was frustrated afterward. A sad smile appeared on Alexandra's face. Then her facial expression changed. -I am sorry, Catherine. I am not in a mood for … She tried to express herself with a gesture but stopped. Apparently, she could not go on. -I will go to my class. See you soon. Catherine looked behind her while she entered one of the lecture halls. In the evening, at home, Catherine thought about her encounter with Alexandra. What happened there? In a few minutes of talking, she saw emotional side of Alexandra, which she had never seen before. Moreover, trying to flirt with Alexandra also did not work. She backed off immediately. She was definitely not happy with this. Therefore, she decided to walk away from Alexandra for some time. Probably, that would give her time to elaborate on her feelings and maybe Alexandra will feel better. A few days passed and Catherine spared her time in the department between classes and her administrative tasks in the office. One time, when Catherine was leaving her office to go home she came across Janette. She was not thrilled by seeing her since she tried to skip conversations with the department staff recently. In addition, Janette was the last one she wanted to speak. -How are you, Catherine? Catherine smiled back at her trying to look natural as possible. -Fine. How are you? -Also, fine. So… How is your friend? She has been delaying her classes lately. -Whom do you mean? -Slonim, of course. Is she sick or something? Walters is worried about her. -I don't know. Doesn't she come to the school? -No. I thought you already knew that. -How should I know? -Well, I have seen you spending time together. Thought you might be close friends since she communicates only with you. With us, she talks briefly and leaves. -She is a little bit introverted person. Probably, that is why. We talk from time to time but we are not that close. -OK. Well, hope she will get back soon. I just wonder whether she is sick or is it her trick since she is such a star. As soon as Janette turned her back, Catherine rolled her eyes. No wonder Alexandra avoids talking to you, Catherine thought to herself. The next week while sitting in her office, Catherine heard someone knocking on the door. \"Come in\", she said with a loud voice. The door opened. Someone came inside and shut the door. Catherine picked up at the visitor. Alexandra was charming her with a wide smile. She pushed her back to the door while holding two cups. -Sudden career change. From now on, I am a coffee courier. Catherine smiled though she tried hard in order not to. She wanted to play hard to get and Alexandra owed her that. Alexandra held her one of the cups. -How have you been? They say you skipped your classes. -I needed to relax. I was not feeling well. -How is your camera? -Like I said, it went as a souvenir to my shelf. I ordered a new one. -I am sorry. -That's OK. What did you do in my absence? -Nothing special. Work-home mode was on and it still is. Catherine responded short and quick. -Is that the reason why you talk to me as if you would like to avoid me? If it is, I can leave. Just say it. Catherine did not want her to leave. -No. I'm just tired and stressed. I am glad to see you again, in fact. -I want to admit. I missed you. Alexandra was looking directly into Catherine's eyes. Catherine sipped her coffee and turned to her papers trying to avoid the eye contact. She heard the sound of the lock. She turned to Alexandra and saw her come closer. She bent towards her and put both hands on armrests of the chair Catherine was sitting on. -I would like to help you to get rid of stress. She moved her hands from armrest to Catherine's thighs and started moving Catherine's skirt up. Then she reached underneath of her skirt and started pulling her tights and underwear down. She was doing it slowly but Catherine could not resist or think at that moment. Her lips were slightly touching Alexandra's lips. Before Catherine could say anything, Alexandra's head was resting on Catherine's lap. Catherine surrendered. She relaxed and put her right hand on Alexandra's back of the head while her left hand was squeezing armrest of the chair.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 Catherine entered the class. She was all flustered and she was late for 10 minutes already. She needed to relax and take a steady breath. Everyone was looking at her carefully and she did not know what to say. She finally broke the silence: -Sorry for me being late. Let us have a pop-quiz for extra 5 points. Please choose one of our already discussed topics and summarize your knowledge about it. You have 10 minutes. While everybody was busy filling in papers. Catherine sat down at the desk. She was very anxious. She started to calm herself down. She remembered that she left Alexandra in the room. Once she recalled about her afternoon class she left the room without saying anything. Besides, what could she say? She did not understand what even happened in the room. After she was done with the class, she returned to her office and discovered an empty room. She looked around. She saw the chair she was sitting while Alexandra... Catherine sat down. Thought a bit. They were flirtatious with Alexandra but she thought that was it. What is going on between them? She mentally tortured herself for a while and then decided to go home. Catherine left the room and moved to her parking space. Once she opened the door of her car, someone with a low but determined voice asked: -Where have you been? Since Catherine did not expect it, she turned around in a rush and shock. Alexandra was standing very close to her. -What the hell! Don't you sneak on me like that! Catherine hissed at her. -I am sorry. It is just... you left without saying anything. Alexandra seemed surprised at Catherine's anger. -What did you expect me to say? And, before answering that question, please tell what the hell happened in the office? -Do you always ask that question after an orgasm? Because believe me, that is not the best way to say thank you. -Thank you? For what? -Wow! You are quite ungrateful. For pleasure, you had in the office. Alexandra was once more flirtatious, seemed casual like nothing happened. This made Catherine even angrier. -Oh, come on! No one asked you to do that. -Maybe not verbally but... -Could you just shut up and take me seriously? Catherine put her right hand on her forehead and closed her eyes for a few seconds. She wished she never had this moment but it was unavoidable. She did not even know what to say. Her thoughts were disorganized. -Coffee maybe? Alexandra said it softly as if she was afraid of Catherine's reaction. Catherine looked at her and saw a puzzled face. -I think it will be better to have a cup of coffee in a place where we can calmly talk without being interrupted or feeling uncomfortable. Catherine did not say anything but nodded. -Also, I think it will be better if I will drive you. Do you agree? Catherine nodded once more and closed the door of her car. She followed Alexandra. They stopped across a metallic Mercedes-Benz. When they were inside of the car, Alexandra turned to look at Catherine as if to check whether she is OK. -Do not forget to fasten your seatbelt. The car started moving slowly. Alexandra focused on the road while Catherine watched the road. Why did she leave with Alexandra? It is not like they are going to solve anything. They tried to solve it once but apparently, they failed. What is she supposed to say now? What are they going to discuss? Just she tried to build a script in her head, the car stopped. She looked around to check whether they have arrived. Alexandra unfastening her seatbelt and the sight of familiar coffee shop assured they are on the spot. She left the car and went straight inside. Once she entered, she remembered that she did not wait for Alexandra but she did not feel guilty. She sat down at one of the empty tables in a far away corner. Alexandra did not join her immediately. She went to the barista. Catherine did not see her. A few minutes later, Alexandra sat down at the table with two cups of coffee. She looked at Catherine with an impression of a child who is lost. After looking around and at each other for a few minutes, Alexandra started the conversation. -Look, Catherine... Catherine looked at her. Alexandra looked as if she knows that she is guilty. -Apparently, I have underestimated my people skills. I don't know why but I thought that... You know, we were flirtatious and I thought that we could hang out sometimes. Since you and I are going through stuff, I thought you would be OK with that. I would never have thought that it might upset you somehow. I wish I could understand it before and would not jeopardize our friendly relationship. I am really sorry. She stopped and looked down. By her look and voice Catherine could tell that she feels terrible. Maybe she is right. She was always flirtatious and Catherine repaid the same in like form. She might confuse this and think of something else. At this very moment, Catherine did not know what to say. -From now on, I think it would be better if we focus on our jobs. Catherine did not say anything. Alexandra took it as a confirming sign. She sipped her coffee and joined the silence. They sat at the table about a half an hour. Once Alexandra finished her coffee she kindly offered Catherine a drive till school parking. Catherine did not say anything but again nodded.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 Alexandra stopped the car next to Catherine's. There was a silence. Catherine gazed at Alexandra. Her hands were on the wheel. She was holding it tight with both hands. Catherine did not know what to say and Alexandra apparently wanted her to speak. After all, she did most of the talking that day. Without saying anything, Catherine opened the door and left the car. However, she went back again and closed the door. -You are right. We were flirtatious. I can disagree all I want but it will not be right. I kind of think of you as an attractive woman but part of me going through stuff says to me to stay away from you. Therefore, I may flirt with you or be extra friendly but I do not want anything to happen that might lead us to weird places where we will not be comfortable around each other. I don't know what to do. It is very difficult. Alexandra looked at her. -The same is with me. -Then why the hell did you... You know. The first time, it was our mutual mistake but today. -I have urges. Alexandra explained briefly. Catherine laughed at her with a nervous tone. -What?! That's it?! Is that your explanation? -You are a psychologist. You should understand me. I find you attractive and sometimes... Actually, most of the time I find you irresistible. I don't know whether it is due to me being lonely for a long time or it is you seducing me professionally. Alexandra smiled sadly. Catherine laughed again and shook her head. -I never tried to seduce you. Silence emerged again. -Is she the one you devoted your book to? Catherine looked at her left. Alexandra's head was down. She did not answer but nodded. -What happened? After a short pause, Alexandra said with a breaking voice. -She died. A few years ago. Catherine did not expect it coming. -I'm sorry. This time pause lasted longer. Alexandra kept quiet. Catherine nervously scratched her coat. She did not know what to say or do. The silence felt like an eternity to her and she decided to break it. -You said we could hang out sometimes. Can I ask you what did you mean by that? Alexandra was surprised by this question. She looked at Catherine with a puzzled face. -I am not sure you are going to like it. -Share with me your thoughts and I will decide whether they are OK or not. -Well, since we are friendly and we have already slept together, I thought we might do it again sometimes. While saying it, Alexandra avoided eye contact with Catherine. After saying it, she turned her face to Catherine and saw a mixture of intimidating smile and insult. -You had a great plan there. The only problem is why you would think that I would say yes to it. -I never thought of you being OK with it. I thought you might be interested. That is the reason I never dared to ask you about it. -OK. Where did you come up with the idea that I might be interested? -You said you are going through a breakup. I thought it has been a while since you had an action. This led me to the opinion that you are also looking for calming your urges. I also noticed that you are interested in spending more time with me, which also means you might like me. Thinking about it all, I thought you might be interested. Alexandra said it all fast and as she planned this talk beforehand. Catherine looked at her with an astonished face. She did not rush to respond. It was as if Alexandra gave it lots of thoughts and there was no other argument against it. -You are asking me to be your fuck buddy. -No, I am not. I just thought about us being friends with benefits. I never asked and I hate that \"fuck buddy\" thing. Alexandra looked irritated. Catherine turned her face away. She liked Alexandra and she needed someone by her side to calm her basic needs. At the same time, she did not want to have awkward scenes at the university. -OK, smarty-pants. What if it gets awkward? How will you manage it? -There is nothing to manage, Catherine. We are two mature adults. We could stop it and end it. Plus, no awkward situations if there is no relationship. This is strictly business. Alexandra responding so quick and with confidence, made Catherine seriously interested in the issue. -You are thinking about it. Catherine looked at Alexandra and saw her smiling. -I need more to agree on that. Catherine said with a brief smile. She wanted to play hard to get. Alexandra's response did not make itself wait for long. -I am a tender lover. After a short pause, they both burst into laughter.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 Catherine finished the classes and went to her office. After drumming with her nails on the table, she took her phone and texted, \"Are you free tonight?\" She put her phone on the table in front of herself. She stared at it waiting for it to buzz and it did. \"Tonight is the night?\" Alexandra being very playful sometimes annoyed Catherine. Especially, during this kind of important moments. She wanted to text her back but before she wrote anything, she received a text message. \"I have a few things to be done. It will be no earlier than 8:00 pm. Is it OK for you?\" Catherine thought about it. Maybe this is a chance to delay it but she did not want to. \"It is OK. I'll be waiting for you at my place\". A few minutes later she received \"Which one do you prefer red wine or rose?\" Catherine texted while smiling, \"Red\". She immediately received a response, \"Please send me your address\". Catherine responded accordingly and put her phone down. She ordered dinner that evening but barely touched it. She was nervous. It was as if she is getting ready for the first date with someone special. \"It is not like we are doing it for the first time,\" she said aloud to calm herself. \"On the other hand,\" she thought again, \"the first time does not count since we were drunk. I barely remember anything\". \"The second time, I did not even do anything\". It was so complicated. Catherine was not used to it. She missed the times when she was in charge. It was 8:00 pm but no one buzzed the doorbell. Catherine walked from one side of the room to the other. \"She is getting 10 minutes late,\" Catherine thought angrily. She sat down on her couch and took the book on the coffee table, and she heard the doorbell buzz. Catherine opened the door after she checked whether it is Alexandra. -Nice place you have. Alexandra did not rush to come in. Apparently, she wanted Catherine's approval. Catherine froze. She was looking at her. Then, realizing she should invite her, asked her to come in. -Thank you. I still cannot get used to it. It is small comparing to my house in Bloomington. -That house of yours... Did you buy it? -No, I inherited it. -I see. I brought wine. I really hope you can differentiate between a good and a bad wine. Alexandra looked at Catherine with begging eyes. Catherine laughed taking the bottle from Alexandra. -Oh, I know how a good wine should taste. -Then, you will definitely like this one. -What a self-confidence! Alexandra smiled in response. -I was worried that you are a scotch lover. Plus, while going to someone's place the first time you do not bring a bottle of scotch. Does not look so good. -If I drank scotch in front of you, it does not mean I drink scotch on regular basis. -It is not about seeing you drink scotch. It is about the way you consume it. You literally inhaled it. While Alexandra was talking, Catherine left the room and reappeared from the kitchen with two glasses and a corkscrew. -I was busy getting drunk. That does not happen a lot. Catherine demonstratively smirked looking at Alexandra. -I will be happy to see you again like that. -That will be difficult to arrange. Catherine opened the bottle and poured wine for both. They sat down on the couch. Catherine tasted the wine. -This is really good. Haven't drink something like this for a long time. -I am glad you like it. It means you can appreciate a good wine. Ethan came into the room and seeing someone unfamiliar locked his eyes on Alexandra. -It is so sweet. Does it have a name? -Yes. Alexandra this is Ethan, my comrade for life. Catherine introduced Ethan with a demonstrative tone. Alexandra stood up and bent down on one knee. -Hey, Ethan. Nice to meet you. Give me your paw. Ethan did so and Alexandra shook his paw. While she was interacting with Ethan, Catherine checked her from behind. She wore a shirt and skinny jeans, which emphasized her body structure. She broke her gaze as soon as Alexandra returned to the couch. -I love dogs. When I was a child, I begged my mother all the time to buy me a puppy. One of my unrealized childhood dreams. -You can have it now. -Having a dog is a huge responsibility and I spend most of my time out of the apartment. As I said before, I love dogs. Therefore, I do not want to torture them. Catherine looked at Alexandra with a kind and understanding look. They continued to drink the wine. Neither of them talked. -So, who is going to initiate this? Alexandra broke the silence. Catherine realized her being also excited. Catherine did not say anything. Alexandra asked another question. -Probably, I should be the one, right? After all, you do not strike me as someone who leads in bed. Catherine felt offended. -What?! I am always the dominating one. Alexandra looked at her with a confused face. She definitely did not believe her. -Sorry if I offended you. The experiences we had do not say so. Catherine could not say anything. She was right. After everything she went through with Jackie, her confidence was pretty shaken up. Thinking about how weak she became, she got angry. She had to gain her toughness back. Catherine put her glass on the coffee table and leaned toward Alexandra. She put her hands around her waist, pulled her to herself and kissed her without hesitation. The kiss was not a tender one. She was angry, angry about how weak she became, how she cannot keep up with youngsters anymore. She kissed her aggressively. She wanted to apply all her anger on her. She wanted to prove her how tough she is. Alexandra put her hands on her back trying to hold her but she did not let this happen. She pushed her hands away and started unbuttoning her shirt. The couch was not so comfortable and Catherine stood up to pull Alexandra to her bedroom. On the way to the bedroom, she continued kissing her lips and neck. Once they were inside of the room, she pushed her to the bed and climbed up on her. Then, she froze. Alexandra looking at her with expectations asked, \"What are you waiting for? Are you going to do it or not?\" DEJAVU. Catherine could not move. This very moment was like a barrier. It felt like if she passes it, everything will be different. Something was stopping her from doing it. Should she listen to her guts? She put her hand on Alexandra's cheek. \"Sorry\", she said kindly and kissed her slowly, tender as if she was making it up to her. They were moving intensively. They were rushing. It was like a competition on who is going to please the other first. In the middle, Alexandra was able to pull over Catherine and got on top. Catherine felt every single of her touches. It was like her fingertips were burning her skin while her lips were caressing her neck. \"Look into my eyes\", Alexandra whispered and Catherine did. She looked into her blue eyes and saw her pupils dilating.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 Catherine woke up to a sound of rustle. She looked around and saw Alexandra's back. She wore her bra and was putting on her shirt. This scene only was enough for Catherine to get turn on again. Alexandra turned around while buttoning her shirt. She looked at Catherine with a happy smile. -Thought you will not wake up and decided to leave without saying goodbye. -Sorry for ruining your plan. -This way it is even better. -What time is it? -Almost 11 pm. Catherine's brows lifted. She did not expect it to be so late. It was like only an hour ago Alexandra came to her house. -It was a great evening. Alexandra broke the silence. Catherine smiled. -It was. Alexandra came closer to her and bent over. She kissed her forehead by just putting her lips on it tenderly. Catherine felt all the warmness of her lips. She liked it. -Thank you, Catherine. See you later. -Bye. It was only thing Catherine could throw through her lips. Alexandra left. Catherine laid back on her bed. She was thinking about the night, about the great sex she just had. She did not have something like that for a long time. In fact, when was the last time she had this kind of good sex? Here it almost banged her in the head. Jackie. It was Jackie she had sex the last time. Wow. Maybe that was the reason why she hesitated to make the first move. She felt ashamed. All her satisfaction was forgotten. Now, she was thinking about Jackie only. Why? Probably Jackie already has a partner or hangs out with other people. It is not like she is going to wait for her or something. But what if Jackie really is waiting for her. Maybe she does not go out with other people because she thinks about her as Catherine thinks about her. Catherine continued to think and slowly closed her eyes after devastating herself into sleep. In the morning, Catherine had a shower and checked herself in the mirror. She had a bruise on a spot where her neck connected her shoulder. She looked at it and laughed. She needed to cover it. She stopped her choice on a silk scarf that was supposed to help her that day. After parking her car, she headed to the class. On the way to the lecture hall, someone pulled her shoulder. -Hey, beauty... -What the hell? Alexandra was shining and her wide smile softened Catherine. -Sorry for scaring you. I wanted to ask how you are doing. -Fine, thanks. You? Catherine felt a little uncomfortable. She did not want to discuss intimate stuff right now. -Nice scarf. I never thought of you as a scarf person. -Well, I am not. Catherine smiled but Alexandra was confused. Catherine decided to use this against her. -What is wrong with you? Are you deliberately putting hickeys or are you an amateur? Alexandra flashed an \"oops\" face. -I'm sorry. I don't know how I am doing it. It is something I could not learn to control. -Well, train yourself. I can't walk with scarfs all the time. Moreover, the summer is coming. -I'll try. Alexandra smiled shyly. They began walking together. -You know, I look forward to the next time. Catherine looked at her with a stern face. As soon as she saw Alexandra's innocent look at her, her heart melted. -Are you a needy person? If yes, we are going to have problems. -I am not needy. The last night was amazing. I can't take it out of my head. They both stopped for a while. Looked at each other and Catherine thought that Alexandra is perhaps more sincere than she is. Catherine felt responsibility for her. Maybe the first time, in her life, she was OK in putting someone else's feelings forward. -That night was amazing. You are also amazing. But let's talk about it later, OK? -Alright. They walked a bit and Catherine headed to the lecture hall after saying, \"see you\" to Alexandra. However, she did not rush to enter the hall. She stopped at the entrance and looked at Alexandra moving away.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 They were meeting twice a week and making each other happy. Their times together were a mixture of pleasure and intimacy. After sex, they would usually admit the most personal stuff to each other. Hold each other, listen and understand. Then Alexandra would put on her clothes and leave. This kind of arrangement made Catherine happy though she was aware that her feelings for Alexandra are getting stronger by each day. Besides their intimate nights, they were also meeting in the school for a coffee or lunch. However, those were the times they would only stick to business. Nothing else but only work would be the subject of discussion. During their special nights, on the other hand, work related themes were off-limits. They would drink wine, have sex and talk about life. On an April night, after a steamy sex, they were laying on the bed and Catherine said: -So, now what? What should we talk about this time? -I wonder about your first time. Alexandra climbed on her and faced her with a broad smile. -First time ever? Or first time with a woman? Catherine laughed. -Both. Alexandra got out off her and made herself comfortable on the other side of the bed. -Well, I was 15 at that time and I was one of those popular girls at high school. Usually, my kind of people hang out with those cool people; athletes, handsome guys who goof around etc. Most of the time they lose their virginity to those guys because doing it for the first time with a less cool guy does not make a good impression on you. So it was with me. Jeremy was on the football team and a year older than me. He was tall and handsome. He liked me a lot and I thought that he is the perfect candidate. One day, we had a party at his parent's house. Adults were not in the town. There were lots of people. At a certain point, he asked me to come with him. We went to his room. We were kissing. He started grabbing my ass and teasing my breasts. I was OK with it because I knew how this is going to end. Then he started unbuttoning my dress. I still remember that dress. It was a blue shirt-dress. He took it off and then took his t-shirt off. Laid on me and kissed my neck. Then he pulled off my bra and kissed my nipples. He was rushing and once he took off my panties, he wanted to go straight inside. And then he got himself embarrassed. -He finished it before starting, didn't he? -He did. They both laughed. -You see, that is the problem with men. It can easily happen with them. With women, it is not so easy. Alexandra commented. Catherine agreed. -Yes. That is what makes them perfect as a lover. They know what you want and they never finish it before starting. They continued laughing. -Was he the only one or did you have a few of them before transferring to the female department? -Well, I have slept with a bunch of guys. I even slept with them after turning my direction to women. It is not the same as with women, but it is OK to change the mood. But I'd prefer a woman. I know that with a woman I will always have better sex and it is better to share that intimate and passionate moment with a woman who appreciates it rather with a man who thinks his mission is done. She looked at Alexandra and smiled at her and received the same response. -When did you start dating women? -At my high-school, there was this girl. She was just an average girl who always was silent and many people did not notice her. Even I barely noticed her. At high school graduation. I was drunk. I wasn't having the best time of my life; my parents died, I did not have a boyfriend and I was very lonely. I was trying to find my way to WC and I fell down. Someone helped me to stand up. I turned around and it was her. She asked nicely if I am OK. Then she said I'd better go outside and breeze some fresh air. She guided me. When we were outside, she reached out to me and kissed me. At first, I hesitated. I thought I'll throw up. But I did not. I liked it. It was soft, tender. She was the first girl I ever kissed with. We never had sex but after moving to Stanford campus, I was obsessed with the thought of what it will be like if I will sleep with a woman. After a few months, I was invited to a party of a friend, a guy who was gay, and it turns out to be that there were a few lesbian women. One of them started to flirt with me. I responded with an interest and she invited me to her place. And we did it. -Wow. She must have been an amazing sex partner if she rocked your world. Alexandra smiled. -She was. I still remember the way she used her lips and tongue to make me feel high. It was such a pleasure. How could I not do it with women after that? That is how it all started. -You know, I have never tried it with men. -Really? How? Why? Alexandra smiled. -I always thought I should. At least once so I could tell the difference. Never had a chance. -For all your life you never had a chance?! -Well, my story is... I never had a crush on a guy when I was a teenager. I thought it is OK. I was not so old for it. I was just 14. But one day, after a tennis session in the tennis club, I went to the changing room. I almost packed up myself when I saw a young woman leaving the shower with a towel wrapped around her. The towel was loose and it slipped down. I saw her nude body. She was a beautiful woman in her late teens, maybe early 20s. The picking point is, I got aroused. For the first time in my life. And it was because of a woman. While talking about it, Alexandra's voice was stern. She was upset and Catherine wondered why? -What's wrong? You are talking about it as it is a horrible thing. Alexandra looked at her and said with a sad tone. -In Russia, people do not talk about gays. They do not befriend gays. Being gay is simply not allowed by the society. When you know it all and you think of yourself as a straight person who is accepted by the community you live in, realizing that you are gay is devastating. There was a pause. Catherine did not know what to say. She was waiting for Alexandra's move. -When I got aroused, I was shocked. I was confused, angry and damaged. A few days later, I decided to talk someone. It was driving me crazy. So, I chose the last person I should talk to about it. My mother did not say anything at first. She hushed for a few minutes and then said. \"You could be an alcoholic, drug addict or whore but you chose that? I could tolerate anything but not that! Fix yourself!\" I felt even in a deeper depression. By the death of my father, I became an introvert. After that encounter with my mother, I became even more introverted. We never talked about it again although she knows about my life here. Catherine forced herself to say: -I'm sorry... Alexandra was silent. After some time she continued. -Me losing my virginity is even more creepy. I am not sure if you can be open-minded about that. Alexandra smiled. -Oh, come on. I have done lots of weird stuff. I will certainly be OK with it. After a bit of hesitation, Alexandra said: -What the hell. Let's make a shot. I lost my virginity at the age of 16 to a friend of my mother. -Your mother befriended teenagers? Alexandra laughed. -No, she did not. Her friend at that moment was in her early 40s. -What?![Chapter 19] Chapter 19 Catherine was shocked. It took her by surprise. A relation between an adult woman and underage teenager is quite a shocking thing. -Is having sex with an underage teenager is allowed in Russia? -No. Catherine sat in a lotus position. -Do you understand that it was wrong? Alexandra smiled, as it was OK. -Yes. -Did you tell your mother or anyone else? -Of course, not. It was not a rape or abuse. I wanted it. Moreover, it is not as if we did it only once. We did it regularly like couples. Catherine's eyes were wide with astonishment. -What is wrong? -You have been having sex with an older woman while you were a teenager?! -Yes. -That is illegal, don't you get it? Why are you acting like it is OK? -Because I was old enough to understand that I want it and decide whether it is OK or not. Moreover, I was not as innocent as you might think. -You mean, you made a move on her?! -No... Well, it is complicated. Alexandra sat on knees facing Catherine and started with a calm tone. -Have you ever fancied people who are older than you? It is just like that. She was a close family friend. A member of the Russian intelligentsia. A doctor with gray soft hair. I don't know why she never dyed her hair but she looked great with those. She was a divorced mother of one boy. Intelligent, smart and charismatic. Her stern character was magnificent. I adored her a lot. One day, when my mother was away for the funeral of a relative in another city, she asked her to come by our apartment and check on me. She visited in the evening. We were talking while she was sitting in the armchair and I laid on the sofa facing a magazine. Once we stopped talking I felt her hand on my back. She was slowly and tenderly gliding it towards my butt. At first, I felt shocked though very pleased. Then I heard her whispering about how beautiful I am, and how long she waited before making this move. I turned my face to her in order to resist although I wanted her to take me like a wild animal. She started begging and telling me how she is OK to give anything else in the world just to feel my lips with hers. I let her kiss me. It was my first kiss ever. Alexandra laid down putting her left hand behind her head. She was smiling and Catherine saw how important this memory was to her. -It was my first kiss ever but at the time, I thought it was the best ever. Guess what, it is still great. She kissed me and hugged my waist at the same time. Then she started to kiss my neck. We were kissing for a long time. She was discouraged to make the first move. I put my arms around her neck and moved closer to her. That encouraged her to pursue what she started. She laid me down. Took off my T-shirt and kissed my body all over, then she took off my jeans and everything else. At first, she gave me an oral pleasure. I was ecstatic. Before I was able to recover, I was no more a virgin. Catherine was speechless. Alexandra was telling, literally explaining every single detail of her losing her virginity. And she was talking about it in a way that made Catherine realized that it is not creepy for her. It is a great memory for her. -We were meeting at her place. Twice a week. Sometimes even more. Her son was old enough to live apart. I remember the way I used to torture her. Alexandra smiled. -I would come to her place. She would like to hug me or kiss me and I would resist and make her beg me before letting her to fuck me. I liked when her, an adult woman, begged me to have sex. Then we would do it. At least three times. I became her \"Lolita\". She would teach me stuff like how to prolong the pleasure, which poses are the best etc. It helped me a lot. It still helps me. Alexandra winked. Catherine was speechless. She was not sure what to say. On one hand, this affair was important to Alexandra. On the other hand, it was wrong. Then, she thought about her affairs with students and did not dare say anything. Instead, she decided to ask a question. -What happened? -Well... I left for the US. -Was she OK with that? -No. She begged me until very last moment to stay. But I knew that I am not in a place where I can be happy. So, I left. Years later I emailed her a few times asking about her life. Last year, while visiting St. Petersburg, we met again. You know she is still beautiful. I guess, after all, not the exterior beauty is important to me. For me, at her 50s she still was gorgeous and sexy. -Did you?.. -No. Alexandra smiled. She looked in Catherine's eyes. -I lost Cecile. And at that moment, I was not ready to touch anyone yet. -How did you and Cecile meet? -It was just after my move to the USA. I met her on a student collaboration day at Yale. I was a junior and she was a sophomore. I asked her a question about student clubs and then we started talking. One thing led to another and she asked for my number. I gave it to her without hesitation. At that moment, I did not even know that we might work it out. -How long did it go? -A little bit more than 4 years. They both hushed. Alexandra reclined to bed and put her head on Catherine's hip. While drawing on Catherine's knee with her right pointing finger, Alexandra continued her story: -She was different. Different than anyone else. She always had courage for things I'd usually chicken out. I was more of a poetic person, and she was more of an artistic person. She was the one who encouraged me to travel and love art. We traveled on my motorcycle through Europe. With her, I discovered another part of me. Part of me I needed while growing up. With her, I felt stronger and smarter. Sometimes, I think that she was destined to play a role in my life. Catherine heard Alexandra's emotional voice and put her hand on her head. She felt the warmth of her body and liked it a lot. She was jealous of Cecile memories. She knew it was stupid but still could not help herself. No one in her life lasted that long and she was afraid that no one would. -What happened? -She was in Paris for a few days. On the way to the airport, taxi driver made a mistake, which resulted in an accident. They say she died on the way to the hospital. Catherine stretched her arms and hugged her shoulders. -I'm really sorry. -At first, I refused to believe it. I couldn't make it to her funeral. It took me a week to absorb the information. Then I bought a ticket to Paris and visited her. In a cemetery. She was laying there. I couldn't see her anymore. A long pause there was before Alexandra asked: -What about yours? -Mine what? -You said you are getting over someone. Catherine did not expect it. She stuttered a bit but throw it anyway: -She left. Alexandra stood up and looked at her face. -She dumped you?! -No. She had to leave for California. She had a job offer there. It was a dead end for both of us. So, I let her go. -I would fight for it. -But when you know that it will make the other person unhappy. You are OK with letting her go. -But I wouldn't also accept a job offer on the other side of the country. How could someone accept that when they have you. Catherine smiled. Besides her mocking character, Alexandra was great at flirting. She liked that. It was late when Alexandra left. Catherine put her forehead on the door and exhaled after shutting it. Before going to bed, she checked her smartphone to see if the alarm was set. There was a missing call, which was unexpected. She put her phone in silent mode not to be interrupted. Therefore, she did not hear it. What brought her to the state of shock was that the number of the caller started with 213 area code.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20 Catherine finished the morning classes and went directly to her office. Sat down at her desk began thinking who might call her yesterday. It is not Jackie. Totally not Jackie. Her phone number is different and she said she was going to keep it. Therefore, it is not her. Then, who it was? She had a few friends in California but they never talked on the phone. They would usually email each other. Maybe this is one of the fellow professors at Stanford. She did not talk to them after moving to New York. Probably, they think she is still looking for a job and that is the reason they are calling. Of course! Who else it can be. It is one the fellow professors. That is it. No need to get excited. It is not... Knock on the door interrupted Catherine's thinking. -Come in. Alexandra adored her with her beautiful smile. -How are you? Catherine was caught off guard. She realized that it has been a longer pause. She forced herself to smile and abruptly said she is OK. -Are you coming? -For what? Catherine was lost. She couldn't control it. Neither she understood what Alexandra was saying nor could she answer her. -Department staff is going to lunch. We were going to join them. I am going because you were going. Catherine's face was blank. -Please tell me something. It danged Catherine at that moment. -I'm sorry. I forgot about it. -Please tell me you are going. Alexandra looked with a begging face. -I'm sorry. I am not hungry and I have many things to do. Catherine turned her face to the laptop. -What happened? Catherine turned again to Alexandra. Now she looked worried. -I am sorry. I don't feel well. I want to finish everything as early as I can and leave. It was Alexandra's turn to be silent. -Do you need help? -For what? -Do you need my help for your work or maybe taking you home? Catherine looked at her. Alexandra was nice. She never stopped being nice to her. -Thank you but no need. -OK. See you later. She was going to close the door but she went inside again. -You know, now I am stuck with a bunch of boring staff members. Whose fault is that? She smiled and Catherine felt terrible. She did not have an argument against it. -I'm really sorry. I'd force myself but I'm really not in a mood. -No.. No.. We will find another way for you to apologize. Alexandra grinned and left, shutting the door behind. Catherine looked at her phone screen. It is not her. It cannot be her. She touched the number to dial it. Then her heart almost stopped as if to hear clearly, who is going to answer. A man answered and Catherine felt immediately relaxed. -Hello?! -Umm… Hi. -Can I help you? -Sorry, I... I had a missed phone call from this number. -Have you ever talked with this number before? -No. That is the reason I redialed. I wanted to know who this is. -Sorry. Apparently, there has been a mistake. If it were important, I would call you once more. -Yes. Probably. Thanks. -Have a nice day. Catherine felt a relief. She thought whether she should join the department staff after all. At the same time, she felt exhausted. Therefore, she wanted to go home. She had no other classes and office stuff could be delayed to some other time. Catherine was careful in order not to see anyone familiar. She wanted immediately to go home. She managed to go to her parking spot without problems. Once she made herself comfortable in the car, her phone rang. When she looked at the phone screen, she saw the familiar number starting with 213. She answered with a surprise. -Hi. -Hi again. I am sorry to bother you. You were indeed contacted by the owner of this number yesterday. -Aren't you the owner? -No, no. It is not me. I am her personal assistant. Just a minute. -Wait… Before Catherine could say anything, the caller passed the phone to another person. -Catherine… And Catherine heard. Heard loud and clear the voice she desired to hear for so long.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21 -Hi... Jackie's voice was like a lullaby for Catherine. She did not even realize how much she missed that voice. -Jackie. Oh god. Hi. -I hope you are happy to hear me. -I am. I am happy. -How are you? I hope it is not a bad time. I called you yesterday and you did not answer. Catherine paused. She well remembered why she did not answer. She just did not want Jackie to know. -I'm fine. Sorry, I went to bed too early and did not see your call. -It's OK. -So, what you have been up to? -Nothing special. Just as usual. I wanted to check on you. How is New York? Do you enjoy it? -Well, it is not like home but I try to get used to it. Stop... How did you know that I am in New York? Catherine heard Jackie's laughter on the other side. -I googled you a few days ago and saw information about you in NYU website. Then I decided to give you a call. I hoped for you not to change your phone number. Thank god, you did not. I have really missed you. Catherine's response did not make itself wait for too long. -Me too. -You know, one of the reasons why I called you is, I will visit New York at the end of this week. I thought, if you have time, maybe we could meet and have a cup of coffee maybe. -Yes. That would be great! I'd love that. When exactly will you arrive? Catherine was nervous. Jackie is coming. -On Saturday night. Sunday morning I will be available. We could also have breakfast if you want. -Yes, anything. I mean, you are coming here. We can do whatever you want to do. Catherine couldn't calm herself down. It was Jackie, after-all. She wanted to see her. As soon as possible. -This is my number. Just in case, there will be a change of plans. Catherine knew there would not be any change of plans. She will cancel everything just to meet Jackie but she did not say that in order not to seem desperate. -OK. -Do you know somewhere we can go? Somewhere silent with a few people. -Jackie... I am afraid that I am not so much familiar with New York. -Oh. Then, maybe we could meet at the restaurant of the hotel? -That sounds good. -Then, I will text you on Saturday and let you know the address. -I will be waiting. -We have so much to talk about but I have to go. Anyways... we can catch up when we will meet. -Sure. -It was great to hear your voice. -The same for me. Thank you for calling back. -See you, Catherine. After hanging up, Catherine stayed in the car trying to understand what happened. She just made a plan with Jackie. Yesterday she was not even thinking about her. She immediately remembered about Alexandra and felt guilty. But it did not last long. Alexandra and she were not in a relationship. What they had, was an arrangement. Business like arrangement. She turned on the engine and drove home. As soon as she opened the door, Ethan welcomed her and wagged his tail. Being in a very upbeat mood, she kneeled down and squeezed his cheeks with both her hands. -You won't believe what happened. Jackie is coming. As soon as Ethan heard Jackie's name he jumped on Catherine and tried to lick her face. Catherine laughing tried to push him. -I know. I know. I am also happy. Maybe you also will see her. She kissed his nose to calm him down and moved to the bedroom. Without taking her clothes off, she laid down on the bed smiling. She couldn't stop it. It was Thursday. Two days later Jackie will be in New York. Two days. It so long she thought to herself... Catherine woke up at four in the morning. She fell asleep on the bed with her clothes on. By 7 am, she had a shower, clothed up and sat at the kitchen table to have breakfast. Thinking that Jackie might have texted her, she checked her phone. There were one missing call and a text message. Alexandra made them both. She checked the SMS. \"Hi. Wanted to check whether you are OK. Hope you are all well. In case you need something, let me know.\" It was sweet of her. But Catherine did not want to talk to her. She even put herself a mission to avoid her this week as much as possible. It was Friday and Alexandra did not have a class in the Psychology department, which meant they would not come across each other. During the lunch break, she joined Professor Collins and they discussed department issues. Even Collins made her a comment about looking more cheerful than ever. Catherine smiled and thanked but still could not hide her smile. However, a call interrupted her. It was Alexandra again. She excused herself and left the table. -Hi, Catherine. -Hi. -Are you OK? -Yes. It is just a very bad time. -Sorry, I was worried about you and texted you but did not receive a response. -No, need to apologize. It is my fault. Sorry. Umm... I felt exhausted and left for home. Once I got in, I immediately fell asleep. -Oh. Do you need help? Would you like to grab a coffee? Maybe meet later in the evening? As friends… Not that the way, you know. Catherine paused. -Look... Don't take it the wrong way. But I feel like to be alone these days. I want some privacy. At least for a couple of days. -Did I do something wrong? Did I bore you with my stories? -No, no. It is me. I need a little bit time by myself. I promise to call you once I get well. -OK. Catherine... Alexandra's upset voice stopped Catherine from hanging up. -Yes? -Take care of yourself. -I will. Thanks. On Saturday afternoon, she received a text message from Jackie with the address of the hotel and the time they supposed to meet for breakfast. Butterflies erupted in her stomach when she thought about meeting Jackie in less than 24 hours.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 On Sunday morning, Catherine was standing in front of Jackie's hotel on the West 55th street. She entered the hotel and sat down on one of the couches in the lobby. Then, she typed with shaking hands, \"Good morning. I'm in the lobby.\" She touched the send button. Not a minute passed and she received a response, \"Comin'.\" She was very anxiously. Seconds were like hours. They just wouldn't go. She breathed deeply and exhaled hugely. When she opened her eyes, she saw her. Jackie changed her haircut into a more progressive and short one. She lost a little bit weight but she still looked great. -Hi... Hearing her greeting made Catherine realize that she is real. -Jackie. They were facing each other and smiling at each other. Then Jackie threw herself at Catherine. While hugging her, Catherine was inhaling her smell. -I've missed you, porcupine. -I have also missed you, Catherine. A lot. They decided to apart in order not to get too much attention. Then, they moved to the restaurant. -Tell me. Tell me everything, please. What have you been doing all this time? Jackie looked very desperate to learn about Catherine. Catherine told her everything. She only missed the parts about Alexandra. -I am so sorry, Catherine. I wish there were a way to help you. -It is OK. Catherine reached out and hold her arm. -I am doing quite well. Don't you see? She smiled and saw a smile emerge on Jackie's face. -What have you been up to? -Well, you know about Neptune movie. It did not resonate with all the expectations but it was good enough. That of course, resulted in other short term and profitable projects. That also means that I am neither wealthy nor poor. Now I am focused on chasing bigger projects and that is the reason I am here. -You are landing a job in New York?! -Well, I don't want to jinx it but apparently, I will. There is a new sitcom. It is a new genre for me: comedy. But I read the scenery it looks great. It will be like \"Friends\" but for the new generation. I think it will work out and will last at least 5 seasons, which means 5 years in New York. Catherine was speechless. Jackie is going to live in New York. The same city she lives in. -Superb. When are you moving? Jackie laughed at her. -I am not sure. We are still on the verge of negotiation. We are waiting for the TV channel to approve it. Once it is done, I'll go to LA to pack my stuff. -That is amazing. -You think that is amazing? Do you know what I think is amazing? For me, finding out that you are also going to be in New York, that is amazing! Catherine smiled. -So, where do you live? -Not so far from here. -Really? Is Ethan home? -Yes. -You know, I would love to see him. Catherine looked at Jackie as she was scanning her. Jackie was looking at her with a smirking face. -We can go to my place. You can pet him. He will be very happy to see you. When they entered the apartment, Ethan jumped on them. He was running and jumping around Jackie. Seeing that scene, almost made Catherine's eyes fill with tears. They were all home again. Catherine asked whether Jackie would like to drink something and receiving a positive response went to the kitchen. She took two cans of diet soda. She opened the first one and as she wanted to open the second one, she felt someone's hand on her back. She turned around and saw Jackie standing close to her. -Catherine... I missed you. Catherine put both her hands on Jackie's shoulders and slowly pulled her closer. Like at good old times. Their lips brushed against each other and that was the moment, Catherine decided to take the initiative and not to delay this. She wrapped Jackie with both hands and kissed her.[Chapter 23] Chapter 23 Their legs were brushing against each other. Jackie rested her head on Catherine's bare breast. Catherine was fondling her cheek with her right hand while her left arm was wrapped around Jackie's shoulder. They were happy. -I thought we will never do it again. Jackie said and immediately looked at Catherine. Catherine smiled in response and said: -I understand you well. I have missed you a lot. I was dreaming about and thinking what you might be doing. An idea that you might be with someone was killing me. Jackie hushed. She put her head down. Catherine became uneasy about Jackie's change of behavior. She sat down. -Jackie... Jackie, who faced another direction, looked at her. -2 years is a long time. Do you have anything to tell me? I mean... I did not expect you to wait for me. Jackie still did not want to talk. Catherine put her hand on her arm. -Tell me. Is there anything you want me to know? After a bit of hesitation, Jackie said: -I thought we will never meet again... She was looking directly at Catherine. -You have to understand. I was alone. I did not have lots of friends. So, I started looking up for small flings to make myself feel better. During the filming of Neptune, I had a few one-night stands. It then continued during our premiers around the world. We were meeting a lot of people every day and it was kind of a chance to get a non-serious stuff for a short time... Catherine listening to Jackie was getting more surprised. It was not like Jackie to go around and look for a fling. It was usually what Catherine would do. -... and after the premieres around the world, all the parties stopped. Thank god, or I would become an alcoholic. That wouldn't make any good impression on my arsenal of rumors. After Neptune, I was involved in small projects. One of them was a video clip of a new promising artist. I met this girl during the production. Catherine looked at Jackie with a worried impression. -I don't feel the same about her. She is more attached to me than I am to her. She knows it also. It is not a serious thing. -But you are still with her. Right? I mean you are dating. -Well, yes. I did not have a chance to talk to her. I mean I did not even try. I thought it would be better to talk to you first and be sure that we might get together. Catherine was not happy about this situation. Somehow she felt like Jackie is not eager to get together with her but wants to check what it will be like. -How long have you been dating? -About a year already. Catherine was avoiding eye-contact with Jackie. All the time she was trying to build herself a new life and thinking about her, Jackie moved on with her life. -Catherine... Catherine looked at Jackie. -I am here. I am with you. Isn't it the most important thing? Catherine smiled sadly. -I promise to you. Once I sign the contract, I will go back and tell her everything. I will need to go back anyway; to bring some of my stuff and organize a few stuff. Catherine did not feel well about it all but she decided to get rid of the wrong ideas that might lead her nowhere. Jackie was here. They were together. That is what counts. She kissed Jackie. -You are here. That is more important. They did not leave the bed for the rest of the day. They were making love to each other and then lay motionless and talk about past two years. They were trying to catch up on everything they have missed in each other's life. Close to the late evening, Jackie insisted on going to the hotel so there were no suspicions. Moreover, she needed to rest since she had a morning meeting with a few producers and TV executives. Their trip in the car was also accompanied by a conversation. This time, Jackie shouted a question. -Catherine... Catherine looked at her briefly and smiled. -Yes... -We talked about a lot of things today but you still did not tell me whether you had someone or not. The question got Catherine off guard although she was preparing herself for it. -I did not have a relationship... I was not ready for it. Plus, I had to put my life in order and solve the employment issue. After moving to New York, it took me a lot of time to get used to it and guess what... I still can not adapt. Thinking about it all, moving, finding a job, starting a new life, I had no time for personal life. She hushed and for a long time did not dare to look at Jackie. But when she finally did it, she saw Jackie looking at her emphatically. She felt worse for lying to Jackie. Jackie kissed her on the cheek saying goodbye. Catherine looked at her and saw her going inside the hotel. After sitting in the car for a few minutes, Catherine pulled her smartphone and typed, \"Could you spare your time for me after the classes tomorrow?\"[Chapter 24] Chapter 24 Catherine was sitting in her office. She was anxious and stressed. She started drumming on the table with her nails. Latest events happening in her life made her this way. Jackie is back. That is great. She loves her and now they have a chance to be together. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. However, she was also unhappy. Now, she had to stop her arrangement with Alexandra, which she was OK but was somehow afraid because of all the awkwardness of the situation. Alexandra repeatedly proved herself as a rational and mature adult. Therefore, Catherine hoped for her not to make a scene or another problem. Nevertheless, even if the situation will be cleared, they still will meet in the department regularly and it could make her feel uncomfortable. Another problem with this entire situation was that from the beginning of their second chance with Jackie, Catherine lied. This was especially problematic and Catherine did not know why she lied about Alexandra. Why would she hide her arrangement from Jackie, when Jackie would explain everything going on in her life? Catherine couldn't find an answer to the question because her phone started ringing. It was Jackie calling. -Hey. How are you? -Catherine, this is going to be awesome. -What exactly? -Well, I just left the TV channel building. We were discussing my salary. They confirmed my role as a leading character. Everything is set. The Production Company and TV channel need to sign the contract for our project to start. Once it is signed, I am going to get almost the same amount I got from Neptune movie but per episode. Isn't it amazing? -Wow. That is awesome. I am so happy for you, Jackie. -Catherine, do you get it? I am going to move to New York. We are going to live in the same city. I am landing the greatest career opportunity of my life. Once it is signed, it is going to be a bigger project than Neptune was. This is a chance for both of us. This is kind of universe's call for both of us to go back together. I am so happy. I want to see you tonight. Do you have time? -Yes, sure. We definitely should meet. I can cook dinner for you. Would you like that? -I missed your cooking and it has been a long time since I have eaten a home-made meal. -Deal then. Do you want me to take you on the way home? -No need. I am going to have a few meetings with TV show executives and then I will catch a taxi to your house. Let's say I will be at your house by 6.30 pm. Is it OK? -Yes. -I want to see you as soon as possible. To hug you, kiss you and … -What? Catherine smiled. -Don't act like you don't know. -I am not sure whether I know or not. Could you please clarify? -You know what? Why bother? I'll better show you. Catherine laughed. So did Jackie. -Anyway, I have to go now but see you in the evening. -See you in the evening, porcupine. Catherine was happy. So was Jackie. Nothing could change that. Probably all the stress she has been having recently is meaningless. Everything is going to be great... Knock on the door. \"Oh, not again.\" Catherine thought to herself. She hated to be interrupted when she is thinking and this was happening the second time for past an hour. She forced a disappointed \"Come in\". -Hey. Are you OK? She looked at the person coming in. Black Chelsea boots, black jeans, and a red plaid shirt. Tall and slim woman with blue eyes holding two cups of coffee and smiling at Catherine. Before Alexandra came in Catherine did not even realize how much she missed her. She was so much fixating on the complex situation that she forgot about her as a person, a friend and a lover. She could not help herself but smile back at Alexandra. -How are you? -I am sorry. I did not expect you to stop by. You did not answer to my SMS. -I am sorry about that. I wanted to surprise you but I can come in later if you want me to. -No, no. I am glad to see you. Please sit down. Alexandra sat on the chair in front of Catherine and held her one of the coffees. -I thought coffee would be useful. -You thought well. You are a total life savior. -So? How are you? What have you been up to these days? Catherine hushed. She did not know where to start. -Did you remember the time when we made the arrangement in your car? Alexandra reclined to the arms of the chair and rested her chin on her hands. She carefully looked at Catherine as if she wanted to read what is going on in her head. -Yes, I do. Catherine became uneasy of her Alexandra's look. -We said we can end it whenever we want. Alexandra calmly nodded. -I think we should stop it. Catherine stuttered. She did not dare to talk more. Alexandra looked very calm and Catherine witnessed Alexandra's lips forming a kind of sad smile. -OK. Catherine's eyes were wide with astonishment. Again, Alexandra was very calm and acted as a mature person rather than an uncontrollable hysteric, which Catherine expected her to act like. -Are you OK with that? Catherine almost whispered. -Yes, Catherine. I am OK with that. I can't force you to sleep with me. Catherine felt a sudden relief. -But… Catherine looked at Alexandra carefully. -Can you tell me why would you change your mind? I thought we were doing OK. Did I do something that might hurt you? Catherine hushed for a little bit. She could not decide whether she should talk about Jackie at all. Then, she thought that she owned Alexandra an explanation. Especially after her being so honest and sincere with her. -Do you remember about my ex-girlfriend? The one I was getting over with? -The one who moved to California? -Yeap. That one. Catherine stopped for a short time and then went on. -She is in New York. She is landing a job here and soon she will move here. This is a chance and I want to give it a try. Alexandra smiled. -Wow. That is a hell of a chance, Catherine Stark. It is really great. I am happy for you and I hope you will be happy. -But aren't you mad? -Why should I be mad, Catherine? I would do the same thing if Cecile were back but that is the problem. She will never be back. You have that chance. I don't. I sincerely wish you well. Catherine's eyes filled with tears and she could swear that the same happened with Alexandra. -Thank you. Thank you a lot, Alexandra. I appreciate it all. -So… How do you want me to behave around you? Should I ignore you or should we be friendly but distant? -No need to ignore each other. We still can be friendly. Catherine smiled. -OK. Now we had the talk, I think it would be better for me to move. I have a queue of students with their term projects. -OK. Alexandra moved to the door and as soon as she opened it, she heard Catherine calling her. -Thank you very much. For everything. She smiled and left. Catherine could not move. She was thinking. Thinking about what it would be like if they'd met in a different time and under different circumstances.[Chapter 25] Chapter 25 Catherine checked the chicken. \"10 more minutes,\" she said and closed the oven door. The table was set. Everything else was ready. The main course? In a few minutes, it was also going to be ready. Catherine looked at the clock on the wall. 6:30 pm exactly. \"Where is she?\" She turned off the oven. Just she was going to sit down at the table, she heard the doorbell buzzing. \"Hey!\" she happily exclaimed while opening the door. Jackie was standing with a stern face. -What happened? -On my way here, a kid saw and recognized me while I was catching a cab. He started yelling and calling my name. Seeing that everybody around is turning at me, I ran two blocks and jumped in a taxi passing by. -Oh god... Catherine put her arms around Jackie and tried to console her. Jackie immediately freed herself from Catherine's arms and went inside continuing to grumble. -TV executives and other people believe that I should avoid going on the streets. Apparently, I might catch too much attention. Catherine did not want to say anything. She felt offended. For the past a few hours she was cleaning the house, setting the table and cooking meal for them to enjoy the evening. Now that Jackie is here, she did not even say \"Hello\". Moreover, she is kind of blaming her for getting out of her hotel suite. Without saying anything, Catherine went to the kitchen. She opened the kitchen cabinet and took the bottle of wine she bought especially for the evening. She opened the bottle, poured wine in one of the glasses on the table, and started slowly drinking it. She suddenly felt a hand on her back. Since she did not expect it, she almost spilled the wine because of surprise. -I am sorry. I am sounding like an annoying little brat. It is just; I am very tired and exhausted because of what happened. Catherine smiled. -It is OK. -Did you make something special for me? Jackie grinned. -A new recipe. You are going to love it. Wine? -Sure. Catherine poured wine to the other glass and turned to the oven. -That's interesting… -What? Catherine turned back and saw Jackie watching the kitchen cabinet with the open door where she took the wine bottle. -That empty bottle. Since when do you keep empty bottles in the cupboard? It dang Catherine like a thunder. It was the empty bottle from the night Alexandra came to her apartment the first time. -It was a good wine. I kept it just to remember the name and everything. But I should probably throw it. -Why? -I couldn't find it in the city anyways. Catherine took the bottle to throw it. But Jackie suddenly grabbed the bottle to examine it. -It looks like an expensive one. Where did you get it if it is not sold in the city? Catherine turned back and opened the oven door. She did not want to look into Jackie's eyes when she is lying again. -A colleague gave it to me. -Wow. Then you must really have been bounded with the university staff. Quite a fancy gift. Catherine faked a smile and turned back with chicken in her hands. -They are good and interesting people. -Do you miss Bloomington? Jackie was like on fire that day. She was shooting serious questions that made Catherine uncomfortable. -At first, I did. Now I am used to being here. Jackie was looking at her with a question mark on her face. -Don't judge me. After you left, I spent the whole year at home. I was not invited to the places where they were happy to see me before. People I used to talk were trying their hard to change the route when they were seeing me from a distance. Here, they respect me. They really want me to develop here. I can easily find funds for my researches and publish my articles in many local and international journals. Probably I will easily enhance my career here. Since there are no rumors etc., I can even feel myself as a decent human being. Jackie hugged Catherine saying, \"Everything is going to be great.\" Catherine hoped for it. She kissed Jackie while the latter was holding her. The evening went well. After the dinner, they moved to the bedroom. Although Catherine was breathless from all the passion, she realized something. There has been a change in Jackie's demeanor in bed. She did stuff she never used to do. She kissed her the way she never did before. Apparently, she had an extensive experience after they broke up. It was normal but Catherine was not very happy about it. She missed her little porcupine. She knew also that it would be crazy to open a talk about this. Thinking that she would better hush, Catherine decided to conceal her feelings within inside. The next day, while going to class, she saw Alexandra from a long distance. She was standing in the hall and pressing her back against the wall. A few female students surrounded her around and they were talking to her. \"Probably they are asking her questions\", she said to herself. She continued to watch. Girls were flirtatiously talking to Alexandra and she was explaining something with hands and gestures, the same way she would talk if she is only passionate about the topic. Catherine felt sudden clutching in her stomach. She did not want to watch the scene anymore. Therefore, she went to the class and plopped the door.[Chapter 26] Chapter 26 Days were passing by. Life became routine for both Catherine and Jackie. Since the incident with the fan, Jackie was reluctant to get out of the hotel room. Catherine visited her every day though she was not happy about that. For her, an accomplished academician, visiting a hotel room every day was humiliating. Moreover, the hotel personnel had eyes and attention, which meant they already figured it out what is happening in the room. Jackie's contract was not signed yet but she was advised by TV executives to look for an apartment. Both she and Catherine were looking through online ads. At first, Catherine insisted on a realtor but hiring a realtor meant to walk through the city looking at a bunch of apartments. Since Jackie did not want to leave her room, that was problematic. As for Catherine, watching laptop screen every day was becoming unbearable. She was bored by all the dullness but did not dare to talk to Jackie about that. -Aren't you bored? She decided to test her luck one day. -Bored? Jackie looked at her surprised. -You are always in the room. You don't go anywhere. You spend all your time in front of laptop and TV. If you are not bored by all of this that should be weird. It was like words were flowing from Catherine's mouth and she could not stop it anymore. -I do leave the room. It is not like I am always in the room. -Only once or twice a week to meet with those TV executives. Jackie closed the laptop in front herself and turned to Catherine, as she was getting ready for a serious talk. -You are not happy about that, are you? Catherine felt like they are going to fight therefore she ignored the question and turned her face to the window trying to escape the talk. She really expected Jackie understand everything by herself. -Look… Jackie came closer to her and held her hands. -It is quite disturbing for us to hide in a hotel room. It is also uncomfortable to sit in the room all day. It is going to end soon. One signature and we are going to be free. We can even go to somewhere for a weekend. I promise. It is definitely going to get interesting. -I have this fear that we will never be able to get back to what we were before. I want us to be back. You and me, and everything we were back then. Maybe in a different location but still with the same comfort and happiness. I want us to be able to enjoy this not only in a hotel suite but also in anywhere else. Hiding it here it is like we are doing something wrong. -It is going to change. I promise. You will see that. Jackie touched Catherine's lips with hers. Catherine was still not assured but could not resist the temptation of biting Jackie's lower lip. She laid Jackie on the bed and took off her shorts. She kissed her neck and pulled off her t-shirt too. Her lips were tracing their path from the neck to the breasts and that was when she decided it is the time to go inside. She heard Jackie's long-drawn-out moan. The next day, close to the end of the workday she heard a knock on the door. \"Come in\", she said loudly. Someone came in but she did not look who that person was. She was too busy. -Hey there, sexy. Catherine looked at the guest with a total shock. -Jackie. -You see, I can have a boring life routine but I still can surprise and impress you. Jackie was smiling and Catherine was still in a shock. -But how? How did you find me? -Well, I had to meet with TV execs. After the meeting, I was like, let us make a surprise for Catherine. I googled the department building and when I was here I asked a few professor looking, people, where are academic offices. I had to run two floors looking at the labels and then I saw the office with your name on it. Catherine was amazed. It was brave of Jackie to visit her like this. She was happy. -It is amazing that no one recognized you. -Well, sometimes it happens. I don't not whether I should consider myself lucky or not. Aren't you happy to see me? -Of course, I am. It is just… This is so unexpected. I am going to finish everything and we will leave. -We can go to your place tonight. -Are you sure? -I am. Jackie smiled broadly. -But you should lend me some of your pajamas. -Do you think you will need those? Catherine grinned and received a satisfied response from Jackie. They were leaving the office and Jackie bombarded her with everything that happened to her that day. -… so they said it is set for next Wednesday. Actors, screenwriters, the director, and producers will be there, and they will sign it. Soon we are going to get rid of that hotel room. Catherine smiled. -We should definitely celebrate that. What would you like to eat? It is too late for me to cook and I did not even go to shopping. -Mmm… pizza. Let's make it a pizza night. -OK. Catherine laughed. -But also let's buy some wine and … -Hi. They both turned to the person who said that. Catherine felt how pale she became. -I am sorry. I saw you from a long distance and wanted to say hi. I did not know you are with somebody. Alexandra was definitely uncomfortable to see a foreigner. A few seconds of silence and Catherine interrupted in order not to make it weird. However, her voice stuttered which did not save the situation as she planned. -Hi. Have not seen you for the last few weeks. -I was busy. Presented lectures as a visiting scholar at other universities. -Oh.. Good. Alexandra looked at Jackie who was already staring at her. -Alexandra this is Jackie. Jackie this is Alexandra. They both greeted each other and smiled. Jackie immediately asked. -Sorry. You said as a visiting scholar. Aren't you a student? You do not look old enough to be a scholar. Alexandra smiled. -I get that a lot. She winked and Catherine who was feeling uneasy. -I'm not done with my Ph.D. but I work as a part-time instructor. -Oh… -But hey… I don't want to stop you from whatever you are going to do. I also have to be somewhere else. Catherine nodded in a thankful manner. -OK. See you later. -Bye. It was nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too. Jackie smiled and turned to Catherine. -Wow. She is so young. They were going in the direction of Catherine's car. -She is. She likes it when people are surprised about her age. -Is it real? I mean how old is she? -Something like 26. Maybe 27. -Looks younger but still to be instructor at such a university at such a young age?! That is an accomplishment. Where is she going? Catherine turned around to look at Alexandra and saw her wearing helmet. -Oh, yes. She also drives a motorcycle. -You kidding me. She is young and attractive academician who drives a motorcycle?! She is like a movie character. Catherine smiled as she opened the door of the car. They both sat in and saw Alexandra drive away. -Did you two?.. Catherine was caught of guard. She looked at Jackie and saw her curious sight. -Me and her?! No. Catherine was surprised at how easy she could lie about that. Apparently, she is getting use to it. -Probably because she is not a student. Otherwise… With a half insulted and a half-horrified face, Catherine turned to Jackie and saw her laugh. -Is that supposed to be funny? Jackie, who could not stop laughing, said: -Come on. That is funny. Isn't it? Catherine turned the car engine. Although she was kind of insulted, she tried hard not to laugh.[Chapter 27] Chapter 27 On Wednesday morning, Catherine had a few classes and afterward, she planned to join the lunch with department staff. During the lunch, Janine was unstoppable. Although everyone was tired of her blabbers, no one was stopping her but joining the conversation occasionally. -... which I think is not fair. I will definitely limit the number of recommendation letters I give to students. They should compete for it. I won't work on providing everyone with a letter anymore. Professor Collins interrupted with a calm tone: -Dear, I do not think it is fair. That way you will definitely put those students into lots of stress and I do not think that they will appreciate this on your course evaluation. -Yes, but I have to do it. It is the end of the semester and all I do is writing reference letters when I have so many things to do. For those of you who does not know, I also have a personal life. You are all married and settled down but I still have to work for it. Catherine, you get me, right? Please support me. Catherine stopped eating and looked around to see everyone staring at her. She knew she had to say something. At this very moment, someone said \"Hello\" with a determined and cheerful voice. Now everyone turned to Alexandra. \"Why she is always around when I need her most?\" Catherine wondered. Apparently, everyone was happy to see Alexandra and invited her to join. She looked a little bit hesitant but said she can join for a short time. She sat down next to Professor Collins and put her bottle of water and apple on the table. -Dear, it is not food. You should eat properly. Otherwise, you look very skinny. -I'm not hungry, Professor. Next time, I will certainly join to your luncheon. Catherine was looking at Alexandra and examining her. She had a bundle of leather and knitting bracelets on her right hand, she bought them separately in different countries while she traveled with Cecile. She always showed it to Catherine with pride. Her shoulder length haircut was contouring her face construction. She was good-looking and charismatic. Alexandra looked at her and their eyes met. Catherine felt ashamed but Alexandra flashed her a friendly smile. At that moment, she heard Janine's hysteric voice. -So tell me, I am right. Wouldn't you do so? Alexandra looked thoughtful. -You have a point... Janine looked around proudly. -...but we should put ourselves in those students' shoes. Of course, I never expected a professor to recommend me but I was happy to receive such a support. I was lucky enough to meet great academicians throughout my education. Every single one of them made me who I am today. It is due to them I feel a moral obligation to give back the society what I had until now. That is the reason I wanted to become an academician. If I am going to motivate someone else to do so, I'll be more than happy. She smiled. Everyone sitting at the table looked at her with an adoration. -Believe me, I understand you. However, this is the professional path we chose and this is the hardship that comes along with it. Hope you understand what I mean. It was easy for Alexandra to win hearts of people. This is what made her stand among others. Not her books, not her academic achievements but the way she communicated with other people and made them feel about themselves. After the lunch, everyone left for classes or offices. It happened that both Catherine and Alexandra shared the same route. While walking side by side, they both were silent. Alexandra ended the silence. - She is pretty. Catherine smiled at her briefly but did not dare to say anything. -To tell the truth, I was taken aback when I saw her. I thought she is a student. She is quite young. -Yes. She is. Catherine uttered. She did not know how to support the talk but Alexandra was in her usual ampulla. -Where did you two meet? Why does she even want to know that? -We were introduced to each other by a friend in a private party in Bloomington. -Ow... Anyways, it is not my business. Just for you to know, you both look good together. I hope you'll be happy. Alexandra was smiling. This melted Catherine's heart. Alexandra was always nice and sincere. Catherine never doubted about her being sincere. Her intentions were always kind. -Thank you. By the way, thank you for not going into details about anything. I did not tell her about it. -You mean our arrangement? -Yes. -Why? -I don't know. I thought that way it will be weird and she might get jealous. I will totally tell her about that but later. -Of course, it is up to you. But my advice is, don't do it. -Tell her? -Yes. Look, I won't tell anyone anyways. You should have told her in the beginning. If you did not, then no need after this moment. She won't trust you anymore. Catherine looked at Alexandra thoroughly as if she was trying to analyze everything she just heard. When Catherine was back in the office, she called Jackie but could not reach her. She texted her: \"Let me know when you will get free.\" She spent rest of the day at her desk, evaluating assignments. When she finished grading the last assignment, she realized that it was almost 6 pm. She checked her smartphone and saw no notification linked to Jackie. She got angry thinking probably she went partying with the cast members and executives. She texted her again: \"Hope you did not forget me. Where are you? Are we going to meet today?\" She turned back to organizing her papers and lecture noted. Once she was ready and her desk was well organized, she received a text message. \"I'm in the hotel-FYI\". Getting it as a hint for visiting her in the hotel suite, Catherine replied: \"OK. Will be there asap. Hope this is the last time \" When Catherine knocked on the door and when the door opened, she held out a bottle of champagne to Jackie. -I thought we would need that. -Ummm… Thanks. Jackie went inside with the bottle and Catherine followed her. She did not pay attention that Jackie is not in a mood to talk. She immediately started teasing her and proposing activities, they can do for the evening. A short moment later, Catherine realized that Jackie is not talking and sitting on her bed calmly. Jackie was looking at Catherine as she was going to say something she does not dare to. -What happened? After a moment of hesitation, Jackie said with a calm tone of voice: -Catherine… They did not sign the contract.[Chapter 28] Chapter 28 -How? Why?... Catherine couldn't say anything but continue to look at Jackie with astonishment. Jackie did not respond. She did not even show an emotion. After a few minutes, she said in a calm voice. -Apparently, the TV execs and screenwriters were not getting along for a long time. That is why they did not sign the contract right away. The negotiations were taking place in order not cancel the project… Catherine felt Jackie's voice broke. She immediately came closer to her and hugged her. -Shhh... It is going to be OK. It is not like the only big project you are going to have. You will have so many opportunities. It is all going to happen. If not today, then sometime later. Catherine kissed Jackie's neck. They froze while hugging. After some time, Catherine asked a question she afraid to ask. -Do you have plans? What are you going to do now? Jackie freed herself from Catherine's arms and said with a caution. -I don't know. They pay for my accommodation until Friday and then for a ticket back. Catherine did not know whether she should go on, but she continued. -Are you going back to LA? Jackie stood up and started walking around the room in small and quick steps. -Catherine, I have nothing that might make me stay. Catherine's eyes widened. She was offended. Jackie's response did not make her wait for long. -Look, I did not mean you... It is... I don't have a job with a regular salary that might pay for my accommodation. -Accommodation is not a problem. Let's say, you can move in with me. Will that change your mind and make you stay here? Jackie looked at Catherine in silence. Catherine could not stop herself from laughing nervously. -Of course, you are not interested... Once there is no a contract, then what is the point to stay in NY. -Look, you are wrong... -Am I? You were willing to move to NY and be with me because you had a job opportunity here. You were willing to do it because I was your option to build a life here. Now, you are going back to LA, to your girlfriend and continue to live with her. She is another option but in LA. That is such a great plan, Jackie. What made the situation even worse was Jackie's silence. She did not even try to neglect anything Catherine said. -You are special to me... -Not enough, apparently. -What do you want me to do? I can't move to NY. -Because there are no other jobs in NY. -Catherine, it took me years to come close to an opportunity in NY, whereas in LA during that period I accomplished many other projects. There are at least ten times more opportunities in LA. Catherine was walking back and forth. What Jackie was already saying was not making a sense to her. -If I stay in NY, I will be jobless for a long time. I cannot afford it. It will affect me in both ways, financially and professionally. -Good that you thought on how it will affect you. What about me? What did you think about me? Did you think that I will be OK with all of this shit going on? -You can come with me to LA if you want. -And leave my job? Why should I be the one to sacrifice my career? -There are universities in LA. -Jacqueline, it took me two years to find this job. Two years after you left me, I was unemployed. I wrote to every single contact of mine to find a job and was finally able to land this job. Do you know how miserable I felt during that moment? -Stop it. Don't try to make me feel guilty. I offered you every single option I had in my head. You did not go for a relationship in distance and you did not want me to go out of closet. -You would not go out and announce that you are dating a woman. -I could. -Then do it now. Go out and tell the world you are dating me. Let's work on that distance relationship of yours. Jackie hushed. -See? You just did not mean it. -I am not ready to do it now. I am not in that stage of my career, where I can announce my sexual orientation. -You would never throw yourself at danger for me. -And you? Would you? -I was made to resign from my workplace and had to leave the town I lived for years. And all of it because of you! -Don't you dare to blame me for god's sake! It was going to happen with you anyway and you know it. If not me, then with some other female freshman that would catch your attention. -Fuck you, Jackie! Catherine took her handbag in a rage and ran away from the suite. While elevator doors were closing, she heard Jackie running towards her and calling her name. The elevator moved down and Catherine decided to move on.[Chapter 29] Chapter 29 She was nervously drumming with fingers on the steering wheel of the car. When the green light flashed, she pushed the gas. Catherine was sweeping in New York roads for past an hour. She did not want to go home. She looked at her phone and saw a missed call alert. It was Jackie. She missed the call on purpose in order to avoid talking to her. At this very moment, she felt only hatred for her. Suddenly she turned side and parked the car. Going through her contacts and she tapped on a name. -Come on... Come on... Where the hell are you? No one answered. Getting frustrated, Catherine pushed the gas hard and moved freakishly passing by the cars. She was angry. She couldn't understand what happened. Only yesterday, they were planning a future together. Now, they are going to move on each other. Tears were going down her cheeks and chin. She could not stop herself. She had a chance for love and a happy life but now it is gone. Jackie is going to leave soon and move on with her life in LA with her girlfriend who is waiting for her. And she, Catherine, will stay in New York and continue on leaving alone again. The idea of going back to be alone again was devastating her. No matter how much she tries, she goes back to being alone eventually. She did not know whether she is angry with Jackie for leaving or herself for being lonesome. Phone ringing stopped her thinking. When Catherine looked at the screen, she saw Alexandra calling back. -Hi... Her voice was breaking down. -Hi. I'm sorry, I was in the shower. Are you OK? -Umm... I don't know why exactly I called you. I need to talk to someone and the only person I could think of was you. -It is OK. Where are you? Do you want me to pick you up or meet you at your place? -I remember you living near Park Slope. Could you send me your exact address if it is OK for you? -Sure, I'll text you my location. -Thanks you. After putting down her phone down, Catherine saw the message with location from Alexandra. Half an hour later, Catherine was standing in front of the door. She was unsure whether she should go on and knock on it. Why is she here? Why would she go to Alexandra when having such a personal problem? She knew exactly why. Catherine wanted to talk to someone and did not have anyone else. She had no one to be open and sincere with. She was desperate. It did not take much time the door to open when Catherine touched it with the back of her hand. Alexandra looked at Catherine with a blank face. -Are you OK? You look pale as hell. Catherine could not say anything. She felt her eyes to fill with tears. Alexandra step aside and let her come in. When she was inside, Alexandra invited her to sit down on the couch and disappeared to be back with two glasses and a bottle of wine. -I don't have anything stronger. She held one of the full glasses to Catherine. Catherine took the glass and swallowed its content in one quick motion. When she put the glass on the table, she saw Alexandra looking at her with a puzzled face. -One more? She asked unsure. -Yes, please. While pouring wine, she asked. -Should I wait till you get drunk or you plan to talk soon? -I am sorry. It is just... I am upset. She is leaving... Catherine's voice cracked down. -What happened? Did you have a fight? -We did but right after she told me she is going to leave. -Permanently? -Yes. -Why? -She came here because of a job offer. The project was canceled and now that she is jobless, she wants to go back to LA. -I am sorry, Catherine. -I can't believe her. She was the one to come back to my life and let me make plans about us. Why did she withdrew so quick? -What did she say? -She said, since there is no other reason for her to stay, she should go back to LA. -Well, that's harsh. Hey... Probably, she did not mean it. -Well, she did not neglect it either. A silence emerged by which Catherine could conclude that Alexandra is thinking about what to say. Not waiting for her to come up with an idea, she started aggressively express her feelings. -I believed that this time everything is going to be different. I hoped that our history would not repeat itself again. Right now, I'm where I was 3 years ago. It is Bloomington all over again. She left the school and made my life miserable... -She did what?![Chapter 30] Chapter 30 They were looking at each other's eyes. Catherine knew she did a huge mistake by bringing up Jackie leaving the school but now she did not know how to get out of the problem. \"That is it,\" she thought to herself, \"my life is over thanks to Jacqueline Kirk again.\" Suddenly, Alexandra flashed a sinister smile: -So, you did not meet at the party. Was she your student? Catherine shook her head. -Wow... What is with all this secrecy? I am telling you so many things and apparently, you did not share with me anything. -Look... -I've got to tell you, I thought you are an ordinary boring instructor. Now, I see a wild side of you… Which I like, by the way. Alexandra winked at Catherine and reclined on the couch. Getting Alexandra back to a state where she was intimidating her definitely was not making Catherine happy. She felt miserable. Not only she has lost Jackie today but also her secret is out, which can destroy her already settled life in New York and put her into a difficult position. Where else could she go after New York? Without thinking how to take the communication further, she forced out of herself: -Are you going to tell anyone? -Catherine, please. Why are you so terrified about this? It is not as if you sexually harassed students. You just developed feeling for one of the students. It can happen to anyone... Those conservative idiots think it is unethical though. Alexandra finished the sentence while rolling her eyes. Then she added with a kind smile: -I won't tell anyone. I promise. Catherine felt a sudden relief. -It is a very intimate issue to me. I don't want to discuss it. -It is OK. I don't expect you to tell me everything. It is all up to you. Note that you can always talk to me when you will need to share something. I will be more than happy to listen. Catherine replied with a sad smile. She was relieved that she could trust Alexandra. Looking at her, Catherine wanted to tell her everything. Everything she kept inside herself for so long. -Can I ask you, Catherine? Is that the reason why you left Bloomington? Did you not want to stay there after she left? Catherine looked at Alexandra. She wondered if she should tell the truth? At least a part of it? She was not sure and therefore, she simply nodded. After a brief silence, which was unbearable for Catherine, Alexandra said: -Did you fight for her? Catherine looked at her with a terror of being probed. -What? -I am asking whether you fought for her. Did you ask her to stay that time at Bloomington? Or now, did you tell her how much you want her to stay? -Well, she knows that I'm upset. -It is not enough, Catherine. Did you tell her how much she means to you? Did you offer her to stay a little bit longer? Catherine started thinking. In Bloomington, she was the one to repel Jackie. She was the one to let her go. And now, she is standing here, in front of a stranger and complaining about how Jackie was unfair with her. -In both situations, she was the one who wanted to leave. -Maybe, Catherine. But did you try to stop her? Catherine did not like the direction where this talk was going to. -Look, people come into our lives. Then they might want to leave. It is quite normal. It is up to us if we are going to let them go. -So you think that it is my fault. Catherine felt a burst of anger. -Don't get me wrong, Catherine. But what were you thinking when you fell in love with a much younger woman... Girl. I don't even know how to call her. Don't tell me you expected her to leave everything, move in with you and live with you as a couple till death do you part. Come on, you are a grown-up woman; you must have known that she cannot be trusted with that. -You think I am stupid to fall in love with her?! -No. I don't think you are stupid. We do not choose who to fall in love with. But I think you have missed an important point. You cannot expect a young girl to give up everything and settle down just for you. She is not ready for this. Would you be ready at her age? Catherine hushed. There was a point in what Alexandra said but she did not want to give up so early. -What should I do? -Go to her. Talk to her. Tell her everything you feel. -Why me? -Because you are the mature one. Because you have to do it before it is too late. A day could come when you would wish to go back and have that talk with her. -I have too much pride for this. -Pride is stupid. Alexandra smiled sadly. -How would you know? Have you ever felt the pain of being abandoned? -I haven't. -You see. It is easy to judge me. You have never been abandoned. You had a perfect relationship with the woman you loved and suddenly you think of yourself as a great expert on relationship issues. -You know nothing about me. -Really? What is it I don't know about you? You loved her so much that you can't get rid of her memories even though she is not around anymore. Jackie would have never done that for me. -Don't drag me into this. You know nothing about me, nor her. -And what is it I don't know? Alexandra hushed looking at Catherine with begging eyes to stop. -Come on. Tell me, what is it I don't know about you. What kind of a dark secret might you have? Tell me. Come on, tell me now. -I cheated on her! Alexandra's shout echoed all over the apartment.[Chapter 31] Chapter 31 Catherine witnessed a tear slowly going down on Alexandra's cheek. Her lips were pressed together as if she was mad at herself for saying it. She looked vulnerable: the way Catherine had never seen her before. -Did she know about it? Alexandra closed her eyes for a second and said with a breaking voice: -No. She never knew. Catherine moved to the armchair right in front of Alexandra to see her face clearly. -But why? You were in love with her. At least, that is what you told me. Wiping her tears with the back of her hands like a child, Alexandra looked at the bookshelves next to her. While looking in the same direction, Catherine saw some photos on the shelves. Although she did not see the photos clearly, she knew who was on them. Meanwhile, Alexandra started talking with a calm voice. -I told you pride is stupid. All that pride shit got me into this. She turned to Catherine and smiled sadly. -I loved her a lot. I can't even explain to you how much I loved her. We did not fight a lot but when we did, boy it was something. Before her trip to France, that fucking trip, we had a fight. A big one and we said each other stuff that we did not mean as usual. I was too young back then with a boosting ego. I could not digest her words. I was very angry with her. What made the situation even worst; she left a day later after the fight. We could not talk to each other properly to settle everything down. Later on the day of her departure, I went to a party we were invited together. At first, I did not want to go because she was going to be out of the country. However, after the fight, I decided to go alone. Had a couple of drinks. Talked to a few people. Again had a couple of drinks. Became very welcoming with a girl who openly flirted with me. One more set of shots. A few hours later, I was leaving her naked on the bed in her apartment. She stood up and started walking slowly in the room. While walking in front of the bookshelves she was looking at the other side as if she avoided to look at the photos in order not to come face to face with Cecile. -You know… She turned to Catherine with a sad smile. -I called her in the morning. She apologized for everything she said. I apologized for everything I said. I wanted to tell her about the night. I told her that I want to tell her something very important. Something that is killing me from inside. She said we will discuss it upon her return. I did not want to argue. Therefore, I agreed. I wish, I did not. She never returned from that trip. Alexandra stopped. Her voice broke. It took her some time to start talking. -What about me? I live with the horrible guilt. I die and born every fucking day since her death. I go to her grave at least once a year to apologize. To say that I am so sorry for being a huge fuck-up. I am stuck with it until I die and I cannot get over it. Catherine was speechless. She had to say something but she did not know what. -I am sorry. -I wish you'd never known. -It is OK. I'm sorry for disturbing you. I'd better leave. -Of course… -It is not you. Really. It is… She came closer to Alexandra and looked her into the eyes. -I am sorry to bring you to this state. Apparently, I have been fixating too much on myself recently. -If you still need my advice… Go talk to her. At least you have a chance to do it. Once more, a tear went down on her cheek. Catherine came a little bit closer and kissed her gently on her cheek while wiping off the tear from the other one. -I will. While sitting in her car. Catherine gripped the wheel with both hands. So many things were going on in her head. The information she got on Alexandra in one hand and Jackie on the other hand. She never felt the agony that Alexandra lives in. Not until today. She always thought of her as one of the people who had a perfect life and a relationship without a problem. Seeing her most vulnerable time, Catherine could not forgive herself to bring her into that state of being. Sitting in her car, right in front of Alexandra's apartment building, she did not want to go and leave her like that. She did not know what to do. She was living through a terrible dilemma. After 20 minutes of thinking on what to do, she took off her cell phone and dialed Jackie. -Are you still in the room? -Yes, I am. Where are you? Are you OK? -I am coming to you. I know it is late but we need to talk. We should have talked before but better late than never…[Chapter 32] Chapter 32 -Catherine! Exclaimed Jackie and threw or herself on her. -I am sorry. Sorry for hurting, sorry for saying those words… I… I simply do not know how to make it up to you. You do not deserve it. You do not deserve anything I told you. Catherine's eyes filled with tears. She tried hard not to cry. Holding Jackie, she took her face into her hands and kissed her forehead. -It is OK, porcupine. We just need to talk. We have to solve it. Tears were already dropping from her eyes and her voice was cracking while she talked. She took Jackie by the hand and sat down on the couch making her also sit. -Catherine, where did you g… Catherine did not want to discuss it, so immediately she cut off Jackie and continued to talk herself: -Since you came back, I started making plans about us. The same way I did back in Bloomington. I did it all by myself. Without talking to you. Without getting your ideas on it. I believe I had to talk to you before expecting anything from you. I love you and I want to be with you. You may not be ready to deal with it and until today, I was not able to think of it. I have no right to expect anything from you. Jackie was sitting still. She looked at Catherine as if she could see through her. -I don't know what to say. I did not expect you to think of it. -It took me a long time to understand it. Smiled Catherine. Jackie stood up and put her knees on the ground in front of Catherine. While putting her hands on Catherine's knees, she looked her in the eyes and said: -There is something about you. Whenever I am with you, I feel like I have never felt before. With you, I feel complete, unique and strong. But then… Something happens. Always something gets in our way. The last time it was the job. Now it's … -Again job. Catherine said with a sad smile face. Jackie looked upset. -I do love you. -But you are not ready to leave everything for me. A tear went down on Jackie's face. -I worked hard for all of these. It is not easy to drop it all. -I understand. I really do. -Catherine, I will still love you. -Jackie… Catherine stop because of her cracking voice. -Love is great. But do you know what is even better? To be by my side. I am not in an age when I can fall in love and be depressed about it. I really should start thinking of building a life with somebody. To have someone I can rely on. I am in my mid-30s and I have spent all my adult life alone. Of course, it is all my fault. She stood and started walking in the room. -I did so many stupid things. Looking back at them, I feel like an idiot. Affairs with college students are just a part of this all idiotism. When you came into my life, I thought you would be one of the temporary experiences. But… you were the only one I did not want to end it with. When you started regularly traveling to Los Angeles, I saw the spark acting is making in your eyes and I got scared. I thought you will leave me anyways. Therefore, I wanted to end it before you did it. Otherwise, it could hurt more. Little did I know that no matter who finishes it first, it does not hurt less. She turned her face to Jackie who was sitting on her bed and listening her stumbled. -After you left, I was jobless for a long time and it got me to thinking that I am lonely. Of course, it was not a new observation. I felt that every single holiday. However, loads of work would never let me fixate on it too much. That unemployed period I was in Bloomington I felt that I am lonely and after the reputation damage, I could not go to parties or any other events since people murmuring around made me uncomfortable. Plus, no one wanted to see me anyways. Catherine sadly smiled. Jackie was silent. She could not say anything. After a brief silence, she opened her mouth and a calm voice of a little girl said: -I am so sorry. I am really sorry, Catherine. I wish you would have never experienced that. I was the one to listen to all the rumors about you and sometimes laugh at them because I thought it was funny how others do not know you well as I do. Now, listening to you, I think it was not right. You are not that kind of scary and bad person as they all describe you. You deserve better and you deserve to be happy. I wish I could make you happy. I wish… -You are young, Jaqueline. You are going to have so many chances. I am not getting any younger. I love you but I have to… Tears were choking her and Catherine forced herself to finish what she started: -Although I want you to stay, I have to let you go. Jackie came closer to Catherine and hugged her. When she raised her head, she saw Catherine looking into her eyes. A few seconds later, their lips were touching each other and their tongues were pressed against each other. They were kissing. Kissing as it was the last time they do it.[Chapter 33] Chapter 33 Catherine woke up in the afternoon. She felt sleepy and tired. It was quite late when she arrived home and she was frustrated. Therefore, waking up tired did not surprise her at all. Classes were over, so were exams. The only thing that was left was grading papers, which she could delay until the end of the weekend. That is why she decided not to go to the university. She went to the kitchen to have some coffee. While the coffee machine was preparing the coffee, she sat at the kitchen table and started going through everything that happened the day before. Jackie... Alexandra... Again Jackie... She did not even remember how she arrived. She remembered both Jackie and Alexandra and the conversations she had with them. Also, she had a terrible headache, probably resulted by yesterday's stress. Hearing the coffee machine beep, she stood up to pour herself coffee. Sitting back, she asked herself aloud: -What am I going to do from now on? Sipping on her coffee she stepped into the living room to find Ethan lying on the floor motionless. He was bored. She touched his head with her fingertips and sat down on the arm-coach next to him. She put the cup on the coffee table and reclined on the couch. A tear dropped. She was alone. Still alone. How is she going to live now without Jackie? Jackie... That little girl who turned her life upside down starting from the day they met. Catherine could easily remember how their eyes met and they smirked at each other. She knew she wanted her from that moment. But she did not know who she was, yet alone if she will be interested to become her next oblectation in the bedroom. She remembered their first time when Jackie was all shaking. She also remembered the time, when Jackie called and asked to get her from relatives' house. At first, she remembered all the memories that made her happy. Then came the others. Ones that made her miserable and depressed. Then she remembered all the details of yesterday. It was then, she realized that she left Alexandra in a miserable state alone. She ran towards her smartphone and looked through recently dialed contacts. Choosing the one with Alexandra's name on it, she pushed on it. The phone rang for long but no one answered. It was almost going to a voice message when Alexandra's voice was heard. -Hi. Catherine could sense that it was not a happy hi. -Hi. I'm sorry. I wanted to check whether you are OK. -I'm fine. Catherine could sense that she is not though she said the opposite. -Look, I ran away yesterday but... I really want to be sure if you are OK. -Catherine, I'm. Really. I feel OK. Catherine did not accept her statement. Therefore, she started to insist on seeing her. She thought to see her in person only can assure her. -I'd be glad to pay you a visit. -Catherine, I'm fine and I'm a little bit busy right now. -Doing what? -Umm... My new camera just arrived. -Great! Can I see it too? A silence emerged and made it possible to hear Alexandra breathing to the phone. -Alexa... -You are not going to let it go, are you? -I won't until I am sure you are OK. A new wave of silence did not last long. -OK. I'm home. -I'm leaving now. A half an hour later, Catherine was on her way to Park Slope. When Alexandra opened the door, she looked paler than ever. Catherine came in and was offered coffee. She did not refuse. After Alexandra went to the kitchen, Catherine looked around her living room. It was hard to call it a living room since most of it consisted of bookshelves full of books and souvenirs from various countries. In the center, there was TV with a good audio system. Catherine started walking around. She was in this room the first time Alexandra and she slept together. After running from the bedroom, she found herself in this room. However, she did not pay attention to it since she left the apartment in a hurry. Overall, it was a nice room with lots of interesting stuff. The walls were covered with various paintings and bookshelves. There was an old piano in the corner. By a load of books on it, Catherine understood that it was not used for a long time. Looking at the bookshelves, through the books she saw souvenirs, the photo machine Alexandra dropped and broke, and photos. She came closer and looked at them. In some photos Alexandra was with a girl, in others, it was only the girl. She was young, had fair hair and very tender lines of the face. She was beautiful. At that moment, Catherine heard a noise in the kitchen and walked away from the bookshelves. In the left of the room, there was a desk with a chair next to the wide window. She came closer and saw a box just unwrapped. She saw a black and compact photo machine inside the box. While looking closer, she also saw a half-opened pack of cigarettes next to the box. Remembering Alexandra's comment on cigarettes on the day they first met, Catherine concluded that she is lying about being OK. -Black, I guess? -Yeah. As always. Catherine thanked her after taking the cup from her. -You looked tired. Did you sleep? -Yes. I just woke up very early. The courier was breaking the door. -Oh... Congratulations. I saw the camera at a glance there. -You don't look at it at a glance. You have to touch and feel it. Alexandra said energetically and stood up going to the table immediately. She returned back with the camera. -This is amazing. It is expensive but it worth every cent. Can I? Holding with both hands to the camera, she turned its objective to Catherine. Although she did not want her photo to be taken, Catherine did not dare to refuse. She smiled in response. A click of photo machine was heard. -It does not look like a professional one. How is it expensive? -Well, that is Leica. Q series. It is for professionals but on another level. Alexandra smiled and kneed down to be close to Catherine and show her the photo. Catherine looked at herself. She looked lost in the photo but the photo itself was a very artistic one. She liked it. -Seems like it was shot by a pro. She smiled to Alexandra. Then she suddenly felt that Alexandra is talking about the camera to distract her from other subjects. -Look, about yesterday... She saw Alexandra's annoyed face gestures. The latter sat back to her place and started playing with the camera as a child who wanted to ignore scolding. -I am sorry. I wish I did not come to you with my problems. I wish... -You should never have known what you heart last night. -Look, it is OK. I won't tell anyone. -It is not about you telling someone. I just did not want you to learn. It was a secret I kept for the past a few years and it supposed to die with me. Apparently, I failed in controlling it. I let my emotions loose. -It is OK. Trust me, I will never do anything that might remind you about telling it to me. Just forget that you told it to me. OK? Alexandra looked her with desperate eyes. -OK? Then she nodded. Thus, Catherine felt sudden pride in what she just accomplished. -Did you talk to your girlfriend? -I did. Catherine smiled sadly. -By the way, ex... Ex-girlfriend. -I'm sorry. -It is OK. You were right, she was not ready to settle down. She is an actress and the life that is going around her is too colorful for her to leave all that. Catherine smiled sadly. -I hope it will turn out for good to you. -Thanks. And by the way... I told her about us. -About us?! Alexandra looked with a surprised face. -Yes. By us, I mean... You know... the arrangement. -Oh... Did she get angry? -Surprisingly not so much. She asked me why I did not tell her before. When I reminded her that it does not matter now since we broke up, she said that she would also probably sleep with you. Catherine smiled. -She thinks you are gorgeous. Alexandra smiled back at Catherine. -Anyway, I should get going. We will meet at the university, right? -Actually, no. I graded all the papers and did all the necessary paperwork. So, I will not be around your department. -Wait. They did not offer you to continue on teaching? -They did. They even want me to take one more course, which I am not so enthusiastic about. It is just, with all the Ph.D., work in both departments and the seminars, papers... It would be better to take time off for the summer. I will go on a trip with the motorcycle. -A trip? Where? Catherine asked with a panicked voice. -Well, I will start with Israel then will move to Jordan, then to Iraq. After that, I will have two options. If they will let me in the country, I will drive through Iran to Azerbaijan and after to Russia. Then I will fly back to the US. In case they will not let me in Iran, I will drive through Turkey to Georgia and then to Russia. -That is quite a route. Isn't it dangerous? -Not if you are going to drive through safe roads. Catherine felt a pain in her chest. Somehow she did not want Alexandra to leave. -I thought you are going to be here in the summer. -Well... There is nothing to do around here in the summer. And I am alone. I will be bored. Catherine could swear that her voice almost cracked. -What about you? -Oh. I will be teaching for summer university. -What about vacation? -As for me, vacations are not for single people. Catherine smiled. -I think it would be better for me to go already. -You could stay for dinner. We could order Chinese. -No, thanks. I'd better go. She was opening the door when Alexandra looked at her and smiled. -Aren't you going to say goodbye? Catherine smiled while saying: -Goodbyes are for a long time. To you I want to say... See you.[Chapter 34] Chapter 34 Summer did not pass quickly. It was slow like never before. Although Catherine needed a rest, she did not go for a vacation. Frankly, she did not remember when it was the last time she was on a vacation. In the department, she was bored with on and on talks by Janine. Not only her but also the other department staff. However, no one ever told anything against. So did no Catherine. In the evenings and weekends, she went for a walk with Ethan. Sometimes she would catch up with some of the colleagues. But nothing would replace her misery. The misery she would face right after going back home. She spent most of the time at home by lying down on her bed and staring to the ceiling. Occasionally, a few tears would form and move down her cheeks. She had no one to blame. That was her biggest problem. She let Jackie free and before Jackie, she dated only unreliable students with low self-esteem. Who could she blame now for all the things she is going through in her personal life? No one. Whatever happened, happened because of her. When the summer almost ended and a new semester was going to start , Catherine went to the school to look at her new schedule at the last minute, right before the registration. Once she was in the department administrative building, she talked to a few instructors who were back from the summer holidays. She listened to their stories on how they spent their vacation amazingly and how she should have also used her vacation. She listened to the same talks over and over. When she finally was able to look at the schedule, she heard someone's determined steps from behind. -Professor Stark, you look pale and unrested! When she turned around she saw the person who pronounced those words. Tall and slim, with dark short hair and blue eyes. She could not control it. She literally jumped forward. -Alexandra! Catherine cried aloud and hugged her without too much thinking. While squeezing her shoulders, Catherine thought that she acted in a rush and it does not look good from a side. When they parted, Catherine said blushing: -I am sorry. It is just... So unexpected. When did you come back? She looked at Alexandra once more. She had a shorter haircut than she had before. It was one of those mid-bob haircuts, which highlighted her neck and face. The new haircut was looking good on her. Alexandra's beautiful wide smile was making her looks even better. -I was back yesterday, in the evening and went to bed immediately. I was very tired. I am still a bit tired but it is OK. She continued on smiling. -Catherine, I am happy to see you. Catherine replied without a hesitation: -Me too. Although teaching staff would come near and greet Alexandra, both her and Catherine had a chance to escape and walk to the parking lot together. Alexandra briefly told her how her trip went, how she was disappointed when she was not allowed to go through Iran and how was Saint Petersburg. She told her about this all with a calm tone as if her adventure was not so adventurous. When Catherine asked about that she simply said: -Well, when you grow up and get mature, of course, you do no yell and shout about it everywhere. It was a beautiful trip. That is it. I had several memoirs related to it and lots of photos. In case you would like to see them, just let me know. She smiled. Catherine did not say anything but again replied with a sympathetic smile. -Tell me about yourself. What did you do? Catherine closed her eyes and yawned while stretching out her arms. -What should I say? I fucked up my summer. Taught two courses at the school, went a few times out with some of the colleagues and spent some time with Ethan. That is it. -You are a total party animal. Did I tell you that before? Catherine laughed. -Don't make fun of me. I don't have a lot of friends here. I can't go and party by myself. -Well, I am back. Alexandra looked at Catherine as if she wanted to say something. Anything. They were already in the parking lot, right next to Catherine's Porsche. Catherine put her hand on the car and looked at the other direction. Alexandra did not insist on anything but said with a low voice. -Can you give me your hand? Catherine looked at her with a surprise on her face. She did not rush to do anything or move at all. Only when she saw Alexandra's hand reaching out to her, she gave her hand. Alexandra took something out of her bag. -It has no big material value. I bought it from Jerusalem. You know... I am an atheist. But sometimes I find spiritual and religious things fulfilling. I bought it at a small handicraft shop in Jerusalem. There I met a Rabbi and he told me a story of a guy who fell in love with a girl. However, their families were against their affair. So the boy had no other choice but to run away with this girl and never see his parents again or just forget her. He was not sure what to do. He talks to the girl and the girl advises him to toss a coin. So he does. The coin tells him he should run with the girl but the guy looks at the coin with a disappointment. That is when the girl understands. He never wanted to run away with her. Hence, whenever you are unsure, toss a coin and deep inside it will help you to decide, Catherine. While telling all this, Alexandra tied a knitted brown bracelet around Catherine's wrist. After she finished the story, Catherine looked at her with an admiration. The only thing she could let out of her lips was \"thank you\". After being back home. Catherine sat on the couch and reclined back with a smile on her face. She looked at the bracelet around her wrist. It reminded her Alexandra. Her tender touches while tying the bracelet and her slow but determined voice while telling the story.[Chapter 35] Chapter 35 During the semester, there were no complications. The classes started and so did Catherine's hectic work days. She loved the way work filled her empty life and let her think on personal stuff less. Non-work time made her happy only when she was around Alexandra. The latter was kind enough to make her laugh, listen to various anecdotes and talk about issues she would not normally talk. They would still share their coffee break times and enjoy their time out of school when going for a drink or dinner. Although they were friendly, they did not meet at home knowing that it might lead to an uncomfortable situation. A month after classes started, Catherine was on her way to one of Alexandra's classes. The class should have ended soon and she was rushing towards the classroom with two coffees. She wanted to catch her off-guard. As soon as she reached the nearby of the classroom, the door burst and students started leaving in a hurry. Some of them did not rush since they had questions to ask. After a few minutes, Alexandra appeared on the door and Catherine greeted her with a smile along the coffee. -How are you doing? -Exhausted. That was the last class but it is like my jaw needs a therapy. And that thing in your hand smells amazing. -Lucky you, I got it just for you. Catherine passed her one of the cups while laughing and continued on: -So what are your plans for ..? -Professor Slonim! Both Alexandra and Catherine turned around. Catherine saw a girl with dark long hair and with attractive facial construction. Suddenly she felt a strange saltiness in her stomach. -My apologies for interrupting your talk. It is just... I'd really like to get your opinion on whether I should use Freud in the essay. -It is OK. Well, I think Freud might be a little bit complicated for you. You are a sophomore and usually, seniors rely on him to base their essays on. And not all of them by the way. He is quite difficult, Jane. I would suggest you look for other scholars and then ask for my feedback. -I know, I did it already! I have the list with me... While they were talking, Catherine observed the girl. It was like she is interested to keep this talk as long as possible. Besides, she was very nervous and really tried to get Alexandra's attention. Catherine knew exactly why. She knew the \"type\". She knew it all well. -Could you please look at it? -I would be glad to. But I don't want to make my colleague wait longer. How about you email me in the evening? I will respond to you with my available time slots. OK? A disappointment appeared on the girl's face immediately. She looked at Catherine with an annoyed face and Catherine knew why. The girl nodded and thanked Alexandra with a smile. After she turned around and distanced herself, both women went on their walk while sipping their coffees. -Seems like a diligent student. -Oh, she is. She is a nice girl but sometimes annoying. -Annoying? -Yes. Well, whatever I ask in the class and she raises her hand. Whatever I say in the class, she comes to me after and asks questions about obvious things. Unfortunately, there have been so much of her recently that I got annoyed. But other than that she is smart and nice. Catherine smirked and said: -Why do you think she acts like that? -How would I know? Probably, she desperately needs attention to get a better grade. I am ready to give it to her so she would leave me alone. Catherine chose silence over an explanation. That evening Catherine was thinking about what happened at the campus. She was not used to seeing students going after someone else. It was her who was attracting young students. Catherine started thinking over herself getting older. Probably that is why she could not attract anyone in New York. Years were doing their stuff on her. Thinking about that made her fell into more stress. She could not handle it. She wanted to make herself to do something more that night. Something more than going laying on the couch, snuggling with a blanket and watching a retro drama on TV. She stood up and went to her bedroom, where she went through her wardrobe. When she was leaving home, she was all dressed-up, ready to conquer the outside world. About an hour later she pushed on brakes and stopped the car in front of an apartment in Park Slope. Looking at the lights on one of the windows she had an uneasiness that made her reluctant to go further but she took the bottle of wine she bought on her way and left the car. Catherine heard the voice she wanted to hear when she buzzed the door. At first, she could not speak but she forced herself anyway saying, \"It is me. I wanted to see you.\" When the door opened, Catherine could tell that Alexandra did not expect to see her. Not only her facial expressions but also her appearance told so. She was wearing pajama pants with a Yale hoodie. -I'm sorry. I was at a party nearby and got bored. So, I bought a bottle of wine and thought I will pay you a visit. But if you are not in a mood, I can leave. Alexandra who was already in a mild state of shock realized she has to say something. -No... I'm sorry. It's just... It is a little bit unexpected. Said Alexandra, smiling and holding out her hand for the bottle. -Come in. Catherine went inside and saw the lamp on the work-desk to be on. -Were you reading? -I was reading my doctoral thesis. I do it once a month to see all the flaws and no matter how I much I do it, there is always something that I want to add or replace. It is going to drive me crazy. She smiled at Catherine while putting the glasses on the table. -What is the name of your thesis? -Placement of immigrants in the social hierarchy in the USA. -Really? So how is the situation? Asked Catherine with a tease. -Terrible. Said Alexandra and popped the cork. -And I am going to tell you... It is going to get even worse. -The US has the best environment for immigrants. Thanks. Catherine took a glass Alexandra was holding. -The best maybe but it is not ideal. Plus, it will get even worse. Alexandra sat down by Catherine on the other side of the couch. -So where was this party? -Umm...Brooklyn Heights. Catherine mastered the art of lying and she loved it. -I thought you did not have anyone in New York. Catherine looked at Alexandra and for a moment thought she is interrogating her. -Well, not literally. I know a few people but I am not close to them. Alexandra suspiciously looked at her. -Well if someone is inviting you to their birthday party, then you must be close. Catherine dived into silence thinking Alexandra must have understood. -I never understood those people who would invite everyone to their birthdays. Catherine felt a relief. -I mean come on. Birthdays should be something personal. I hate when people I barely know invite me to their birthday parties. I hate people who invite me to their children's birthday party even more. Catherine smiled with a relief that Alexandra did not get her lie. But also rushed to change the subject. -How are you? -Fine. A silence between them was interrupted when Catherine remembered about photos. -Are you going to show me the photos you shot during your trip? -Ohhh... the photos! Alexandra ran to her work-desk and returned back with a hard drive which she connected to her TV. Once she turned on her TV, they started watching photo slides. Alexandra was going through each photo with a detailed description. The evening was interesting and they were having fun. The bottle Catherine brought with herself was already empty. In the beginning, Alexandra sat at a distance from Catherine. There was a huge space between them. An hour later, Catherine already surmounted that distance and sat close to her. Looking at her carefully, she reached out and grabbed her face while the other was talking. Her lips were rudely haunting Alexandra's lips. When the latter almost begged with a lower voice: -Cathe... Catherine used her tongue to silence her. Biting her lips and taking down her pajama pants while caressing her breasts with the free hand, Catherine knew she is getting power and dominance over her. She liked it. She liked it so much that when Alexandra was moving in spasms of sweet agony, she was getting no less satisfaction. Alexandra sat and hugged her legs thinking over something. Catherine sitting right next to her tucked a piece of her hair into the back of her ear. -Didn't you like it? That was the first time I saw you so vulnerable. Catherine put her hand on her hand and that was the moment Alexandra held back her hand. -I wish you did not do it. -Why? You liked it and I can tell that with a clean consciousness. -Look, Catherine... You cannot come into my place in the evening just because you wanted to fuck someone. Catherine's eyes widened. She did not expect that coming. Alexandra stood up and started going back and forth, talking nervously. -There was no party, right? You just made up the whole thing to come here and do me. Catherine was silent. She did not want to refuse anything because she could not make up a good lie after all of these. Therefore, she went straightforward. -Yes. But does it matter? What is wrong with me \"blowing some steam\"? You did the same thing to me a few times. So what is wrong with it now? Alexandra hushed and Catherine could not think of anything else: -Did you meet someone during the trip? Is that what it is all about? -No. I did not. -Then what is wrong? -I can't... I don't want to sleep with you. -Why? Alexandra did not look at her. She turned away her face. -Are you going to talk to me? A new wave of silence. -As you wish. But do not come close to me anymore. Said Catherine and took her trench coat leaving and slamming the door behind.[Chapter 36] Chapter 36 After their argument, Catherine did not see Alexandra nearly for two weeks. Although she tried her best not to come across her, she also wondered whether Alexandra did the same. She was angry with her but she was also upset not seeing her around. What happened to that flirting and playful young woman who would jump at her at the first chance? What did change her so much? Catherine had two possible answers to that question. First, she might start dating someone and that was the reason why she did not like the idea of having a casual sex. But Catherine did not want to believe in that. Alexandra herself denied it. Why deny when she can say it to Catherine? Second, Alexandra might be angry with Catherine because of Jackie. It was she, breaking the arrangement after all. Thus, the night at the apartment was a vindictive plot against Catherine. All of these was driving Catherine crazy. However, she did not plan to do anything about it. After a few more days, Catherine was parking her car in the university parking lot when she saw a black motorcycle parked at the far corner of the parking lot. When she left the car, she looked around to spot Alexandra. There was no sign of the latter. When she entered the university building, she deliberately started walking slowly to carefully look around. -Professor Stark! Catherine turned around to see Professor Smith. -Hi... Catherine felt uneasy because of the unexpectedness. -Hello there. Are you looking for someone? You were walking very slowly. -No... It's just... I have something in my mind. That is why I decided to take my time and not to rush to the class. -Oh, I see. Mind if I join you? -No. Please. Two women started walking in the same direction. -So, are you getting ready for the annual department night? -Which night? -Well, we had it last year. You were there. -Oh... That... Well, I did not receive an email. -No one did. They usually send it a week prior to the night. Catherine remembered the last department dinner. There she met Alexandra the second time and got her business card. Walking with Professor Smith, Catherine was able to spot Alexandra. \"Finally!\" she thought to herself. While Professor Smith was talking her ear off, she was staring at Alexandra with a hope that she will see her. But she was looking at the other direction. Catherine lost the last hope. Just they were passing by Alexandra, Smith said with higher voice volume: -Hello, Professor Slonim. Alexandra turned around and came face to face with Catherine. She nodded her head in the direction of both women meaning to respond to their greetings. Then she turned to the person she was talking to. Catherine saw her talking to the same girl who interrupted them the last time. \"That bitch is getting what she wants\", Catherine thought. Once Catherine was nearby her classroom, she said goodbye to Professor Smith but did not rush to go inside. She was sneaking on Alexandra. When Alexandra moved towards the exit, Catherine went after her. Alexandra was sitting on the motorcycle and was putting her helmet on when Catherine grabbed it. -Who the hell do you think you are? Why do you act like this? I totally do not deserve it. Alexandra was silent. -And now you are not even talking to me? Why? What did I do? Did I do something that offended you? Alexandra did not even try to make an effort for the sake of a conversation. -Go to hell, Alexand... Catherine yelled but her voice broke. She threw the helmet at Alexandra who caught it immediately and stepped quickly towards the building. -You are a dumb blonde. Alexandra yelled and Catherine turned around furiously. -What? Alexandra laughed nervously. -You are dumb. Catherine did not understand what is happening. -You should understand why I am acting like this. If you don't, it is your stupidity. Catherine was aggressively tuned at the moment. She was keeping herself from jumping on Alexandra and beating her. -If you could explain yourself, I would. It is stupid of you to think that I should understand everything going in your head. -You mean you don't get it, right? Catherine did not and she was wondering. -You mean, you do not understand that I have feelings for you? While talking, Alexandra took off from her motorcycle and came closer to Catherine. -All this time... I have been doing my best to get your attention. I have been pitching you with information on my past and myself to make you feel the same way I do. I tried to make you be my confidant so you could have feelings for me. I got close to you, got into your bed, I did it so we can get closer. But you did not care. You ran away once you had a chance. And even after that, I was nearby you to support you when you had a problem with your girlfriend. Catherine was beyond surprise. -You said you are OK! -Because it did not matter... You would still leave. Because you are in love with HER. I can't sleep with you. I cannot become your toy for satisfaction. It is too hard on me. And if you don't get it, then it is my fault to fall for the wrong person. Alexandra jumped back on her motorcycle and put her helmet, and moved away in a one quick motion.[Chapter 37] Chapter 37 Catherine turned on her laptop to check the email box. While the system was loading she started thinking of Alexandra's talk a few days prior. Better to say \"an angry outburst\". She knew Alexandra might like her but she never thought of her having serious feelings for her. In fact, Catherine believed her to be still in love with Cecile. Therefore, when Alexandra opened up to her, she was startled. Thus, she could not say anything to her. Since she did not know how to behave around her, she was glad not to come across her in the building halls. When the system loaded and she opened her inbox, Catherine saw a bunch of emails from students. Usually, those kinds of emails were aimed to schedule a short talk in the office about boosting grades or asking for guidance. There was one that was different than the others. It was an electronic invitation to the annual department night. That evening, Catherine went over her wardrobe trying to choose a dress for the department night. She made her choice in favor of a red dress thinking this might make her look better and get Alexandra's attention if she shows up for the night. Yes, she decided to face her. She could not let them not to speak to each other anymore or act like they are strangers. After the speech of the Dean, Catherine started aggressively looking around but still could not find her. She was angry at herself for showing up but at the same time for spending so much time on herself to look good. What the hell she was thinking? Did she believe Alexandra will jump on her on the first chance? Plus, why did she think she will attend the event? She mentioned hating these kind of events and attending them only because she has to. After the speech, everyone started socializing and Catherine decided to leave. But, her attempt was blocked by Professor Smith who literally grabbed her by arm and asked to join their group. -Where are you going? You look all lost. Were you looking for us? Now Catherine was lost. She stammered: -Yes... I could not see anyone from our department and was a little bit lost. Smith introduced her to a few people from other departments and Catherine became a hostage to dull speeches of a few professors in their mid-50s. After a half an hour, Janette joined them to say hello and Catherine for the first time felt happy to see her. Not to miss the chance, she insisted for her to stay and join their informative talks. That was how another half an hour went. It was the middle of the event when Janette mentioned: -By the way, Catherine you look very stunning tonight. Anyone you want to catch their attention? She winked at Catherine. The question reminded Catherine about Alexandra. Thus, she felt sudden humiliation and anger. But, she briefly smiled at Janette. After which, Janette said aloud. -Seems like queens always are late./p She nodded in a direction behind Catherine./p When Catherine turned around she saw her. She wore an emerald-green dress and looked gorgeous. Catherine gazed at her chapfallen. Alexandra moved slowly as if she was cautious and was greeted by most of the people. She stopped by some professors and exchanged a few sentences. Then she joined department deans and smiled at their comments. When she was passing by their group she said hi and moved on which made Catherine angry. But, bad for Alexandra. Professor Smith caught her too and literally forced her to join them. \"Aha... you get what you deserve!\", thought Catherine. She looked directly at her eyes. But, Alexandra persistently was avoiding an eye-contact with her. In fact, she looked like she wanted to wrap up the conversation. But, Janette interfered. -Professor Slonim, may I ask why both of you... She motioned in Catherine's direction and Alexandra looked at Catherine in a quick motion. \"-... look so gorgeous tonight? Do you both try to get someone's attention? Because you know, this is not the best place to do so. There are almost no bachelors here. Everyone in the group started laughing but two people. Alexandra forced a brief smile and excused herself to go to the lavatory. After she left the group, Catherine also excused herself and went after her. Alexandra reclined to the wall and started breathing heavily when the door burst and angry Catherine jumped at her pushing her to the wall. -What are you doing? Are you going to avoid me for the rest of your life? She yelled at her. At this precise time, they both heard toilet flush. So, Catherine parted herself from Alexandra and put some distance between them so people would think they are having a simple argument. Once an old woman left the toilet stall, washed her hands and left the lavatory, Catherine furiously turned at Alexandra who was rubbing her left shoulder which Catherine unintentionally hit to the wall. -What do you want from me? Alexandra asked in a low volume like she is giving up. Catherine started calming down realizing angrier she gets, more frustrated Alexandra becomes. -I don't want anything from you. I just want to be around you. I know, I have not been around for you as much as you were there for me. But, I want to be around you, hear your stories and talk to you mine. Alexandra avoided eye contact as she were going through what Catherine said. -I like you a lot. I really do. I like everything about you. Your looks, your intelligence, your action in bed... You are not a toy, you are more than a friend to me. It's just... I want to be fair with you. I don't want to deceive you. I care about you and I don't want you feel miserable. Alexandra looked down. After a moment of silence she forced out a few words out like she does not want it to be heard. -You do not remember me. Although Catherine did hear what she said, she still asked immediately -What did you say? Alexandra raised her head looked straight into Catherine's eyes. -We have met before. Catherine, being still confused, asked again: -What do you mean? -I mean, we had met before. Before that evening in the library. Way before... Processing her words, Catherine forced herself to remember whether they had met before that evening. -I... I do not... -Recall it? Alexandra assertively continued on looking into her eyes and Catherine gave up on trying to remember when and where they might meet. -I am sorry... I am truly sorry... I really don't... -It is OK. - Alexandra said and continued - After all, you were the one to impress me. -When did it happen? -2005. In Stanford. A flashback happened in Catherine's mind: -Annual Psychology Seminars. -Yes. - Alexandra confirmed. -But you... -I was a student who had a chance to ask a few questions on your talk about Abnormal Psychology. You, on the other hand, was a brilliant Stanford graduate. Catherine looked at her with an impression of shame. -I liked you a lot. Your physical appearance, mind, enthusiasm and the way you talked blew my mind away. I had a crush on you. When I returned back to Yale, I told Cecile about you. She was jealous but she mocked me from time to time about it. Listening to her, Catherine was greedily grabbing every word trying to establish at least some kind of memory. But she was not able to do so. She did not even remember any faces from that event. Considering Alexandra's attractive look, she thought she should have remembered her. -Look, I am sorry. I do my best right now but I can't remember… Is that the reason why you were smoking that day in the library? -What?/p -You lit a cigarette in front of me and said you do it when you get stressed. Alexandra did not respond. -I am sorry. I am really sorry for everything I have put you through. I was clearly oblivious to you until you point it out to me. And… And I can't even explain it to you how much I hate myself for ignoring you because I like you. I like you a lot. I mean it from deep of my heart. But I was not able to say so… because I was afraid you won't believe me. If I were you, I would also not believe. For god's sake, I stopped our dysfunctional relationship for getting back with Jackie and returning back to where we were just after the break-up would not look good. It would seem like a substitution of one failed relationship with the other. I did not want to put you through it too though I cannot stay away from you. I wish I could get back and make it up to you but I can't. But in case you let me, from now on, I will do my best so we can put everything behind. ","Summary":" Chapter I It has been a month since Catherine left Bloomington. She never thought about leaving the"},{"Movie":"Bloomington","Title":"Crumbling Walls","Author":"snwm","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11317865","Passage":"[Chapter 1] She put all of her weight down on the suitcase until she finally got the zipper closed. Catherine looked around the room one last time to make sure she wasn't forgetting anything. As she was skimming the room her eyes caught site of the stuffed bunny sitting on her headboard. It was preposterous how many emotions and memories could be tied to a stuffed animal. She tried many times to throw it out, I mean come on, she was a 33 year old well distinguished woman. She has a reputation to live up to. But it never failed, anytime she tried letting go of the small toy she never could. It was given to her as an Easter present from her mother when she was a young child. After her parents passed away in a plane crash she couldn't bear giving up any of the items she received from them, hence why she still lived in small town Bloomington. A woman like her strived for bigger and better things but this was home to her. She tried leaving once before when she attended Stanford for College, but came back as soon as she graduated. After she lost her parents it was all she had left. This and a few material items, including the stuffed bunny. She felt robbed of her life without a family so she held these items close to her, they were the only things that she sought comfort in. All of a sudden the painful memory of Jackie insulting her inheritance came to mind. The tone of her voice, making her sound like an unmotivated, spoiled brat. Spoiled? Losing your family at the age of 15 is quite the opposite of living a spoiled life. Sure, the house was a lot nicer than everyone else's her age, or anyone else in Indiana for that matter. And sure she had nice clothes and a fancy Porsche, but what else was she supposed to spend the money on? She didn't have any children, no family, no spouse. She would give all of it up in a heartbeat to replace the emptiness she felt every night when she came home to an empty house, and every holiday she had to spend alone. Instantly, she felt the ache of her broken heart. It was that moment, almost a year and a half ago, when Jackie uttered those hurtful words that the rage inside of her just exploded. She remembers trying to cool herself down all night at the fundraiser but she couldn't get the words out of her mind. When her date dropped her off she saw the glow of the TV through the window. She couldn't believe Jackie had stayed after all of the vicious comments they exchanged, just hours before. As much as she tried to cool down, it didn't work. Jackie crossed the line so she decided she would do the same. She invited her date to come inside for a nightcap. Catherine turned on the lights and from the corner of her eye, saw Jackie rise from the couch as she crossed the room, ignoring her presence on purpose. Her date then pointed out that there was someone on her couch. This was her moment to inflict the pain Jackie had instilled in her. \"Oh, yeah, it's that kid from that TV show, it's called Saturn, something.\" Saturn, nice one she thought to herself. Jackie was so proud of Neptune 26, it was the one thing she sought comfort in, much like how Catherine felt about her house that Jackie insulted. She saw Jackie roll her eyes. Now it was time to finish this. She invited her date to go upstairs with her, then looked Jackie straight in the eyes and said, \"Hey, uh, make sure that you shut off the TV when you finish watching your cartoons. Okay?\" That was it, she saw the hurt in Jackie's eyes, mission accomplished. No one would ever hurt Catherine Stark and get away with it. The sex was miserable. She thought it would make herself feel better, help get her back to her old self. The self she was before Jacqueline Kirk came in and made a mess of it all. She had spent half of her life building a fortress around herself, to protect her from never having to feel the pain of losing someone she loved ever again. How could she let one, quiet, awkward girl come and destroy it all. Her connection to Jackie was instant, but lust usually was. It usually took her a few weeks to find her next conquest, but last year it only took her one day. When she entered Hecht's office and made eye contact with Jackie she felt an instant spark and could tell the young girl did too, with the bashful smile she flashed her. The next day Catherine paid close attention to the faces in her classes, searching for the one she saw the previous day. The cute and innocent girl with the cute and innocent smile. It was her last class and Catherine saw no sign of her. She felt disappointed, she was eager to start this new affair but then remembered that Thursday was the Psychology mixer. Any student taking a psychology course was required to come, and since the young girl was in Hecht's office, she should be there. After her final class was over she headed to the library to pick up some books for the research article she was working on. It was a large heavy stack and she struggled getting them back to her office. Student's were bumping into her the entire time, causing her to become more frustrated. When she finally reached her office door she tried balancing the books on her thigh so she could get her key out. When she almost had it, someone bumped into her from behind, making her lose grip of it. It was then that she heard a soft voice behind her say \"Here, let me help you with those.\" Catherine sighed a grateful \"Thanks,\" in relief. Her and the student entered her office and set the books on her desk. \"It's funny how these people can afford tuition but not manners,\" Catherine annoyingly stated. The girl responded saying \"So I've noticed.\" She must be a freshman Catherine thought. She started checking off her list of things that needed to be completed when she heard the girl fumbling around her shelves, eventually asking Catherine a question that she didn't quite make out. Catherine looked up for the first time, and the moment the student turned to repeat herself, she realized it was the girl from the office. Catherine played it cool, let the game begin she thought. The girl kept making small talk about the ECT machine, they were alone in the office so Catherine knew this was her chance to test the waters. \"Does this one work?\" the girl asked, referring to the machine. Catherine smirked and made her way over to her. \"I don't know. I haven't used it in a while,\" she responded in a playful manner. The look that came on the girl's face was one of both curiosity and fear. She fumbled some words around then stated she needed to get to class, quickly making her way out the door. Catherine laughed at her reaction and knew she needed a little more time to make her move. The next day Catherine was asked to sub for Professor Newberry, he had a personal matter that needed tending to. Annoyed that she had to give up her free period, Catherine entered the class room already agitated. When she asked the class where they had left off, they all looked away. She was in no mood for this so zoned in on the first student to make eye contact. The girl nervously stuttered, not remembering, that's when she dropped her notebook and leant down to retrieve it. At that moment, Catherine spotted her newest conquest sitting behind the girl. She didn't let this break her stride and continued on, she did however notice that the girl could not keep her eyes off of her for the entire period. The following day was the psychology mixer. Catherine made sure to look her best that day, knowing her conquest would be in attendance. Sure enough, she spotted her across the quad. Not only that, but she again wasn't taking her eyes off of Catherine. After Catherine finished talking to Professor Hecht she noticed the girl's friends were no longer by her side and she was not only still staring at her, but was now proceeding to make her way over to Catherine. Catherine stared back but then a staff member approached her to talk. Damn't she thought, but this is probably for the best. If she was going to start a relationship with a student, she didn't want anyone seeing them together, especially since she wasn't completely convinced the girl was interested. Thankfully the conversation didn't last long, she looked where the girl had been standing but she was now gone. She quickly looked around just in time to see her duck behind the rock wall on the side of the building, so she followed. When Catherine approached her she was leaning against a rock, nervously playing with her cup. Catherine immediately put up her intimidating front, but once she saw the despair in the girl's eyes she remembered her agreeing with Catherine in the office, that the people around here have no manners. She told her it was okay that she wasn't mingling, then decided it was time to formally introduce herself. The girl responded, stuttering, \"Jacqueline Kirk.\" \"Ah, the famous one\" Catherine replied. She had no idea that the girl she sought after was the actress everyone was buzzing about on campus. She was shocked when Jacqueline responded saying, \"So are you from what I hear.\" Catherine knew she had a reputation, but didn't realize that freshmen would hear about it so quickly. Jacqueline began sending flirtatious queues so she knew this was her moment. She tucked some hair behind Jacqueline's ear, when Jacqueline didn't give a negative response she went in for the kiss. After she slowly released her lips from Jacqueline's, she saw the shock in her face and asked if she was okay. When Jacqueline nodded she invited her back to her place, they needed to get away from campus before they were seen. Jacqueline was hesitant at first, but eventually gave in. Then began the scariest journey of Catherine's life, allowing herself to fall in love for the first time. Catherine saw a tear drop land on the stuffed bunny. She quickly dabbed at her eyes remembering the morning after her and Jackie first slept together. She awoken to the noise of the door closing and saw an empty bed. At closer observation, she saw that it wasn't empty, there lay her stuffed bunny. She knew from that morning that Jackie was different. She usually didn't let her conquests spend the night, but Jackie had been so nervous the night before. Catherine wasn't completely heartless to kick her out after the emotional night they had spent together. Most of the other girls were nervous the first time too, but no one compared to Jackie. Jackie being a Hollywood star and all, had just as much to lose as Catherine did if anyone found out about them. They were equals. Catherine wished she would have been strong enough to let her walls completely crumble for Jackie. She had never opened up to anyone the way she had with her, but at the first site of trouble she built those walls back up in a hurry, protecting herself from the potential hurt. Little did she know, she was already too far in, and building those walls was the worst mistake she had ever made. She let her fear and anger get the best of her and let the love of her life walk away. Catherine held the bunny close to her heart before placing it back on the bed. She had to get a move on if she was going to make her flight. Before leaving the house, she bent down to give Ethan a hug and whispered in the dogs ear, \"wish me luck.\"[Chapter 2] Catherine laid back in the seat terrified. This was her first plane ride since her birthday last year, and this time she didn't have Jackie there to hold her hand. Once the plane took off she felt herself relax. This ride was a lot smoother than the small plane Jackie took her up in. Maybe this wasn't so bad after all. She immediately grinned knowing Jackie's theory was right, she faced her fear and now the fear had diminished. This just confirmed that even though Catherine was the college professor, Jackie had taught her equally as much in the time they had spent together. Catherine fell asleep after reviewing her notes and by the time she had awoken, the flight was over. She had survived. As soon as she exited the airport she felt the warm California sun on her skin. She didn't realize how much she had missed this place until now. After checking in to her hotel she went up to her room to unpack and settle in. She turned the TV on in the background, \"The stars will soon arrive for the Hollywood premiere of Neptune 26.\" Catherine immediately glanced at the TV. What were the chances, the day she lands in California is the same day Jackie's movie is premiering. When first being asked to speak at her alma mater, of course the first thing Catherine thought about was Jackie. But just because she was coming to California didn't mean she thought she would see her. Especially since Stanford and Hollywood are a good 5 and a half hour drive apart from one another. But sure enough, as soon as she stepped foot in California, she was reminded of Jackie. They hadn't spoken since the day Jackie left her house. As much as Catherine wanted to, she needed to put the pieces of her life back together and she also didn't want to hold Jackie back from her dreams. She was a little hurt that Jackie never made an effort to check in, especially knowing that Catherine was left with a shattered life, but she understood. After all, she was the one who told Jackie she wasn't worth it, and she was the one who brought a man home right in front of Jackie. Catherine paced the room for a good half of an hour until she finally grabbed her phone. This was Jackie's big day and she wanted to be the bigger person. \"Hi Jackie, it's Catherine. I know it's been a while but I saw on the news that your movie premieres tonight. I just wanted to wish you good luck and hope that you are doing well.\" Catherine retyped this message a handful of times, making sure not to come off as pathetic. Jackie was sitting in her hotel room having her hair and makeup done for her big premiere when she heard her phone go off. \"Who is it now?\" she asked her assistant. Her phone had been going off all day with people giving her their well wishes. \"It's a text message from someone named Catherine.\" Jackie's heart dropped, \"give it to me.\" She struggled to look down at her phone through all of the hair that was clipped in front of her face. She opened the message and suddenly felt a surge of emotions run through her body. She couldn't believe THE Catherine Stark had just texted her. She quickly replied knowing her time was limited. \"Hi Catherine! Thank you so much :) It's so good to hear from you. I don't have much time to talk right now, but we should catch up sometime soon.\" Sent. Catherine couldn't believe how quickly her phone lit up. She didn't want to sound needy so decided on a short and sweet, \"Sounds good. Talk to you soon.\" You would think sleep would be an issue that night considering she had just spoken to the girl she had longed for, for the last year, but after the tiring day of traveling she had endured, Catherine passed out as soon as her head hit the pillow. The next afternoon, Catherine's phone begins to ring, it's Jackie. Her head is spinning a mile a minute and her heart is racing. \"Hello Jackie\" \"Hi Catherine! How are you doing?\" \"I'm good, how was your premiere last night?\" \"Great! Thanks for asking, I was shocked to hear you saw it was on the news in Bloomington.\" \"Oh no, it wasn't. Well, not that I am aware of. I am actually in California right now.\" Jackie stuttered, \"Y-you are?\" \"Yes, I was invited to speak at Stanford about my article on the Theory of the Reversal of Self Denial.\" \"Oh wow.. that brings back some memories,\" Jackie laughed. \"It sounds like you did a great job on it if you were asked to speak at Stanford. Impressive. I know how hard you were working on it.\" Catherine smiled on the other end of the phone, thinking about that day in the library. \"Thanks Jackie, there was one upside to losing my job. I found myself with plenty of time to really immerse myself into finishing it.\" Jackie sighed, her tone suddenly filling with guilt. \"Catherine, I still feel really terrible about that.\" \"Jackie, please don't carry that guilt around any more. I was too careless with our relationship. You were the one who was hesitant and cautious, it was my fault and everything happens for a reason. I promise you I am fine with it all.\" \"Cute, cute\" Jackie said, \"So we WERE in a relationship\" she said in a sarcastic tone, mocking Catherine. \"Oh stop\" Catherine responded laughing. Before they knew it they were on the phone for an hour, catching up on the last year of their lives, making sarcastic jabs like their old selves. \"So when is your big speech? How long are you in California for?\" Jackie asked. \"The speech is Friday and I leave Sunday night.\" \"I really wish I could meet up with you at some point considering you are in California, and who knows the next time you'll get on a plane.\" she teased, \"but it being premiere week and all, my schedule is jam packed.\" Catherine's phone starts to beep. She looks down, Stanford is calling her. \"Jackie I hate to do this but that is Stanford calling me and I need to take this. It was really great catching up with you, good luck with your movie, I'm sure it is great.\" \"Oh, okay… You too Catherine, I know you'll do great with your speech!\" After hanging up with Stanford, Catherine sits on the bed, she looks at the TV and sees Jackie. Jesus, she's everywhere. It's coverage of the red carpet at her premiere last night. Catherine's heart melts at the sight. It's only been a year but she looks so much more grown up. All of a sudden she sees a young man grab Jackie's arm and kiss her on the check. She turns the mute button off and hears the host say his name and it rings a bell. It's the costar Jackie was teasing her about, the one with the crush on her. The tingling sensation she felt in her heart immediately turns to pain. The next night while at dinner, Catherine receives a text from Jackie. \"Hi Catherine. Just wanted to wish you luck on your speech tomorrow. You're going to do great! :)\" Catherine is at dinner with the Stanford psychology department so doesn't respond. A couple hours later when she returns to her room she remembers Jackie's text. \"Thanks Jackie, sorry, I was at a dinner with Stanford. Also, sorry for jumping off of the phone so quickly last night.\" \"Don't worry about it, I completely understand how that can be,\" Jackie said. \"By the way,\" Catherine said. \"I saw you on TV on the red carpet. So that's the Tommy guy you warned me about ;)\" \"Haha, yup! Good thing you weren't the jealous type though, right?\" Catherine took a while to respond, not knowing what to say. She didn't want to come off sounding jealous, she wanted to keep her hard edge since Jackie clearly had moved on, with Tommy. \"You two look like a sweet couple. I'm really happy for you. I'm glad you're in a great place in your life and have everything you ever wanted. But listen, I need to practice my speech so I'll talk to you later. Good night Jackie.\" Catherine was thankful she had an excuse to stop talking before this went any further. A few moments later her phone lit up. Jackie was calling. Before Catherine could even say hello, Jackie began talking- \"Want some help practicing your speech? I'm really good at memorizing lines ya know.\" Catherine really didn't want to talk to Jackie but it wasn't a bad idea, considering the only person she had practiced on was Ethan, her dog. Catherine sighed saying \"Fine\" and quickly began her speech, leaving no time for small talk. When she was done Jackie was silent on the other end. \"Jackie? Did I put you to sleep?\" \"No\" Jackie said. \"I forgot how hypnotizing your voice was. Then add in your Reversal of Self Denial and my mind went straight to the library.\" Catherine was silent. She didn't know what to say, then before she could stop herself she blurted out, \"I don't think your boyfriend would appreciate that comment.\" \"Boyfriend? Oh, Tommy? He's not my boyfriend. As actors we are taught to flirt during our press tours to attract ratings, that's all.\" \"Ah\" Catherine replied, \"well anyway, what about the speech itself?\" \"It's great Catherine, really. You sound confident and prepared as usual, you're going to nail it.\" \"Thanks Jackie, I appreciate your help but I really need to get some sleep now, big day tomorrow.\" \"Oh, okay\" Jackie responded, \"Good night Catherine, I wish I could come tomorrow but know you'll do great.\" \"Thanks Jackie, good night.\" Catherine put her phone on the charger and went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. She turned off the light and closed her eyes when she heard her phone ding. \"I'm sorry, I know you're trying to sleep but I just wanted to get something straight. You said earlier that you were glad that I have everything I wanted and that's just not true. I'm happy out here and really enjoyed being back with my Neptune 26 family, but I just wanted you to know that leaving Bloomington was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.\" Catherine was going to ignore the text, she had enough on her mind as it was, but she felt her heart warm at Jackie's words. She knew she owed her at least a response so typed two short words to summarize it all. \"Goodnight Porcupine.\"[Chapter 3] Catherine decided to go for run when she woke up to help shake off the nerves. She went over the speech in her head but something kept clouding her thoughts, Jackie. She thought about her text last night and wondered if Jackie still had feelings for her. She shook her head to shake the thoughts out. Jackie wasn't going to ruin this day for her, she had worked too hard and lost too much this year for it to not run smoothly. When she got back to the hotel she showered and got ready. She pulled her black skirt suit out of the closet and put it on. After she was finished with her hair and make up she looked in the full length mirror on the wall. Damn, it felt good to be back in a suit she thought. This is the first time she had worn one since leaving the university. After giving herself a pep talk in the mirror she made her way to Stanford. A few of her old professors met her backstage to wish her luck. She peaked out of the curtain and saw the packed auditorium. Feeling nervous, Catherine started doing her breathing exercises. Okay, this was it, her time to shine and get her career back on track. She looked out into the audience and felt a sudden spike in confidence. All of these people were here, at Stanford, to hear her speak. After she was finished, she felt a little piece of herself fall back into place. She hadn't felt this happy in a long time. Getting back to doing what she loved made her feel like herself again. She was led to the lobby for a meet and greet cocktail hour. So many people came up and praised her work. It was in between groups that Catherine spotted her. Jackie was standing in the corner of the room and smiled at her when they caught eyes. Catherine must have looked like she had just seen a ghost, but managed to flash a quick smile. After she finished talking to a group she politely excused herself and made her way over to Jackie. \"Jackie, how-what are you doing here?\" Catherine asked, shocked. \"I was able to hop on a jet after the press junket was over. I'm sorry I've been hiding out back here. I had a few people recognize me and I didn't want to ruin your night. Wow, that makes me sound so vain.\" \"Jackie, don't apologize to me after you just went out of your way to come here. I really appreciate it. And you can't help it that you're a big movie star now,\" Catherine teased while poking her in the shoulder. Jackie gave one of her infamous bashful smiles then said, \"Hey! You did great! You were absolutely glowing up there, and I've heard nothing but good things as I've been back here eavesdropping.\" \"Thank you\" Catherine said with a smile. There was an awkward pause between them, much like there was at the library that last day when they hadn't spoken in months. Catherine ended the silence by asking Jackie when she had to leave. \"I'm here for the night, but have to catch a flight back tomorrow morning.\" \"Well I'm almost finished here, do you want to go get a drink or something?\" \"That'd be great\" Jackie smiled. \"I have a driver out back so he can take us if you'd like.\" \"Okay, let me go wrap up here then I'll come meet you out back.\" Catherine left to go finish the meet and greet but Jackie stuck around for a few more minutes. She was in awe at the sight of Catherine. The moment she saw her in Hecht's office she was immediately drawn to her, and that hold she had over her only got stronger the more she got to know her. If she was being completely honest, she didn't think she would care too much for Catherine beyond her exterior. Growing up in Hollywood, she learned that people who looked like Catherine usually didn't have the best personalities. Boy was she wrong. Sure, Catherine was intimidating and somewhat of a bitch in class, but as soon as she was alone with Jackie, she shed her rough exterior. Jackie remembered the first time she saw her in sweats and not all done up, she didn't think it was possible but Catherine looked even more gorgeous. Seeing everyone rave over Catherine made Jackie smile but she suddenly felt jealous standing there alone in the corner. She wanted all of Catherine's attention and was envious of everyone else in the room. She knew this is what Catherine must have felt the night of the Neptune party, the night of their fight. How was she so stupid to just leave her hanging that night with a group of strangers. With that, Jackie headed out to the car to wait for Catherine. About 15 minutes later she saw Catherine exiting the college. The driver got out and opened the door for her. \"Oh Fancy, Neptune\" Catherine joked. \"Yeah, I know.. Sorry but my manager insisted that I not travel alone, especially during premiere week.\" \"Well where would you like to go to? I'm not sure what type of privacy you're looking for\" Catherine asked. \"Your choice, these are your old stomping grounds after all. I'm sure we will be fine.\" While they were on their way to the bar that Catherine recommended, the driver cut in, \"I'm sorry to bother you Miss Kirk, but there have been a few paparazzi following us since we left campus.\" \"Dangit\" Jackie said. \"I'm sorry Catherine, but do you mind if we just go back to my hotel? I have an unnecessarily big suite that they booked, might as well make the most of it.\" All of a sudden Jackie's face turned red. \"I-I didn't mean it like that, I mean there's a separate sitting area and even a bar that we could hang out in.\" Catherine smiled, \"I knew what you meant. Don't worry about it Jackie, it's not like we never had to deal with this issue of not being able to be seen in public.\" Jackie shot her her usual side smile.[Chapter 4] Jackie slid the key card to her room, flipped on the lights, then held the door open for Catherine. \"Thank you Ma'am\" \"You're very welcome. Do you want a drink?\" asked Jackie. \"Sure.\" Jackie laughed at herself as she got on her knees and cracked open the mini bar. \"This is the best I can do.\" Catherine laughed, \"You're such a classy movie star.\" \"So what will it be?\" Jackie asked. \"Surprise me.\" Jackie skimmed the mini bottles then smiled. She grabbed two glasses from the shelf and poured the drinks. When she turned around she saw Catherine sitting on the couch and made her way over. She handed her the glass, it was scotch. They both laughed. \"This is really weird\" Jackie said. \"What is?\" \"You sitting on the couch, while I pour us glasses of scotch. It's like déjà-role reversal-vu.\" \"Fancy lingo there,\" Catherine laughed. \"Why thank you. I mean, I am the very studious Catherine Stark after all.\" Jackie stiffened her body pretending to be Catherine. \"Oh, you are, are you? Well then, I guess I-I'm Jacqueline Kirk and I-I'm on the verge of having a heart attack.\" Catherine stuttered, while nervously looking down, fiddling with her glass of scotch. \"Shut up!\" Jackie said, smacking Catherine in the shoulder. \"I wasn't that scared!\" \"You keep telling yourself that Jackie, whatever helps you sleep at night,\" she laughed. \"You're so mean to me.\" Jackie playfully pouted \"You know... it's not a bad thing,\" Catherine smirked. \"I found it extremely adorable.\" They both flashed each other a smile. Catherine could feel the tension forming between them. She loved how playful their relationship had always been, but it always led to more. They were never friends. As soon as they met things had escalated quickly. So sitting here, acting like they were was torture, when all she wanted to do was lean in and kiss Jackie. She quickly changed the subject. \"So you haven't said much about the movie yet.\" Catherine said. \"Tell me how it went. How'd it feel getting back into character and back into your old world.\" Jackie inhaled deeply then let it escape slowly, sighing.. \"I'd be lying if I didn't say it took some time to transition back into this life. It was exciting to see my Neptune family that I left so long ago. But I hadn't been a part of that life for quite some time. There's a reason I decided to move across the country to go to school in Indiana. I craved normalcy after missing out on so many things, like school and being around people my own age. Don't get me wrong, I love acting but I really miss feeling like a normal person with a routine. And school. I really miss being in class as weird as that sounds. Can you believe Bloomington was the first time I attended class in a real classroom, with normal people, since kindergarten?\" \"'I'm sure that is difficult, especially since you worked so hard to be seen as just another student in Bloomington.\" Catherine responded. \"It is. Filming went great though. Being on a soundstage is where i feel the most comfortable and confident,\" Jackie said. Catherine felt a twinge in her heart. Hearing Jackie say how rough it was getting back into the Hollywood lifestyle, made her think maybe she was going to give it all up again. It was clear to her this is where Jackie belonged though, where she is the most happy, and she needed to accept that. \"That's great,\" said Catherine. \"Do you have anything else you're working on?\" \"No, nothing lined up at the moment. The Neptune 26 release is really consuming all of my time, but I'm hoping to do some more auditions once this all slows down. What about you? Have you found another teaching position?\" asked Jackie. \"No, but I haven't really tried. I literally spent all of my time and energy the past year working on getting my article published. Now that it is, and after speaking tonight, I am hoping to get some offers or at least an idea on what I'd like to do next\" Catherine said. \"Do you still want to teach?\" \"I'm not sure. I'm a little burnt out on all of the drama that comes with working in a school, and not sure I want to go back to that.\" \"That's understandable. Honestly, you have far more talent than being stuck in a class room all day.\" Catherine smiled, \"Thanks, I am hoping I do.\" \"Did I ever tell you that you basically helped me get this role?\" Catherine scrunched her forehead, \"What are you talking about?\" \"It was the whole speech you gave me when helping me write my essay. The night after I auditioned I was in my childhood room and found a box that Mark had given me for my birthday. Until then I wasn't completely sold on the idea of returning to acting, but then I got emotional looking through the box and realized how lost I had felt since leaving the show. After that I took your advice from my essay and used it to persuade the execs as to why they should hire me. And it worked, so thanks!\" Jackie smiled. \"Wow, well I'm glad I was able to help you but I'm sure it was all you that got you the job. You know you helped me too. This was my first plane flight since you forced me on yours and I must say, It's not as scary as I remembered, or as scary as yours at least\" Catherine smirked. \"Forced you!? You know you loved it!\" Jackie proclaimed. \"That was the scariest day of my life,\" Catherine joked. Little did Jackie know it was not only scary because of the plane flight, but also because Catherine finally admitted to herself, and a sleeping Jackie, that she had fallen in love with her. Jackie involuntarily yawned as she laughed. Catherine looked at the clock, \"Oh my God it's 2:30 in the morning, what time is your flight?\" \"10 a.m.\" \"I should go,\" Catherine said. \"I'm sure you're already exhausted from today and need some sleep before your flight.\" Catherine pulled out her phone and started dialing a cab. \"What are you doing? You're not taking a cab, I can have my driver take you back.\" \"Jackie I am not having that poor man drive me back to my hotel in the middle of the night.\" \"Catherine, why don't you just stay. The couch pulls out, there's plenty of room here. We can drop you back off tomorrow before we head to the airport.\" Catherine shot her a look of hesitation. \"Please? I'm alone in these hotels enough, it's been nice having some company.\" \"Okay, fine. But, I'm going to need to borrow at least a T shirt, God knows any pants you have will be shorts on me,\" Catherine laughed. \"Very funny,\" said Jackie. She went into her bedroom and brought back a shirt and shorts, \"These should work.\" \"Thanks.\" \"You're welcome. Well I guess I'll see you in the morning, we can order some room service,\" Jackie flashed a giant smile. Catherine laughed, \"Sounds good, goodnight Jackie and thanks for the clothes.\" Ten minutes later Jackie peeked her head out, then came back with an armful of pillows and blankets. \"How about you take the bed and I take the couch?\" \"No Jackie, I'm fine here, you don't have to do that.\" \"Well, you are my elder so…\" Catherine's mouth dropped and she smacked her. \"I don't sleep anyway, I'm a vampire, remember?\" \"Oh yeah,\" Jackie laughed. She headed to her room but turned back one last time, \"Hey Catherine..\" \"Yeah?\" \"Nice suit by the way,\" Jackie said with a wink. Confused, Catherine looked over at her suit, nicely folded on the chair. Then it dawned on her, it was the same suit she wore the night Jackie first came to her house. Catherine smiled and said \"Good things happen when I wear that suit,\" then turned off the light as Jackie disappeared into her room.[Chapter 5] Catherine woke up to the sound of the shower running. A few minutes later, Jackie entered the room. Jackie watched Catherine standing there wearing the clothes she leant her, folding the blankets. She was extremely turned on at the site. Usually it was her wearing Catherine's clothes since they always stayed at her place, so this was a first, and hopefully not the last. Her thoughts were interrupted when Catherine noticed her in the door way and began to talk. \"Great, you get to take a shower and put on fresh clothes while I'm here with bed head.\" \"Oh please, you could be wearing a paper bag and still look fucking gorgeous.\" Jackie said rolling her eyes. Just then there was a knock on the door. \"I ordered some room service, I didn't want to wake you\" Jackie said. \"I wasn't sure what you wanted so just ordered a few different things.\" Catherine headed to the bathroom to freshen up and change back into her own clothes. As soon as she looked in the mirror she was mortified. Her hair was a mess and her make up had smudged. While she was taming the situation on her head, she remembered Jackie calling her gorgeous and caught herself smiling in the mirror. It's been a long time since she's smiled like that and knew Jackie was to blame. As they were eating, Jackie asked Catherine what she had planned for the next two days. \"Nothing in particular, just figured I would stay the rest of the weekend since it's not every day I get a free trip to California.\" \"You know, there's a lot more to do and see in LA than here at Stanford. You should just change flights and come hang out with me in LA,\" Jackie said, in a somewhat teasing manner. \"Right. Don't you have a full schedule with all of your press for Neptune 26?\" \"Not really, I have an interview this afternoon but they were nice enough to give me Sunday off.\" \"As tempting as LA sounds, I'm meeting up with some old friends I haven't seen in a while for lunch\" Catherine said. Jackie knew it was a long shot but figured she'd try, which is why she made it sound like she was only half serious. The truth was, Jackie didn't have many friends, at least real ones, back in LA and it got pretty lonely. She had forgotten how much fun her and Catherine had anytime they were together. After breakfast they got ready and made their way to Catherine's hotel. As they pulled to the front door Catherine turned to Jackie, \"Thank you so much for coming, it really meant a lot to me.\" Catherine placed her hand on Jackie's. Jackie winked, \"I couldn't let you come to California and not see me.\" Catherine smiled. \"My offer still stands if you change your mind, I'd be happy to entertain you in LA.\" \"I appreciate the offer but you need to get back to work. I'm sure Wade wasn't happy about your little adventure,\" Catherine smirked. \"You're right he wasn't, which is why I have to get back to LA so soon.\" Catherine leaned in to hug Jackie. The smell of her hair alone was enough to make Catherine cancel her plans and join Jackie in LA. Jackie tightened her grip around Catherine's neck while Catherine tried hard to swallow the lump quickly forming in her throat. She gently rubbed Jackie's back, letting her know she was going to miss her too. As soon as she felt Jackie's arms loosen she quickly put on a happy smile to disguise the pain. \"Have a safe flight.\" \"You too Catherine, don't be a stranger\" Jackie said with a smile. And with that, Catherine exited the car and waved goodbye. When Catherine got back to her room she sat on the bed thinking about the night before. Part of her wished Jackie hadn't of come. She felt like she had fallen in love with her all over again, which was silly because all they did was talk. But Jackie had always been so easy to talk to, Catherine missed being able to confide in someone like that. All of a sudden Catherine began to cry. Instead of stopping herself she just let it all out for once. Despite their age difference, Jackie was everything she had ever wanted. The fact that Jackie had flown to Stanford, to surprise her and support her, made Catherine cry even harder. No one had ever been there for her the way Jackie always had. Again the guilt and regret kicked in, how could she of told Jackie she wasn't worth it when Jackie was willing to make it work back then? Catherine looked at the clock, realizing she needed to start getting ready. She calmed herself down as she took a long shower. Jackie was having a hard time keeping it together. As soon as they reached the airport she could see the paparazzi waiting. Funny how she can walk around her neighborhood in LA just fine, but cant even spend 12 hours here at Stanford without them finding her. They must have been here since last night, knowing she'd show up eventually. Great Jackie thought, just what I need right now. When the car came to a stop, her driver told her to wait so he could come and get her. As soon as the door opened Jackie put on her happy face. They began shouting questions, asking why she was here. Jackie ignored them and kept on smiling. By the time she got to her seat she was physically and emotionally exhausted. She pulled out her phone and texted Wade and her manager letting them know her flight was on time and what gate to pick her up at. When she glanced at the empty seat next to her, she felt her heart ache. She wasn't surprised Catherine turned down her offer, it was a long shot after all. But she wasn't expecting Catherine to not even think twice about it. Unbeknownst to Catherine, Jackie had purchased two tickets back to LA, perhaps she was being a bit too optimistic. Although the trip wasn't a total bust, it didn't exactly go as Jackie dreamt it would. Usually Catherine couldn't keep her hands off of Jackie. Even last year after their fight and not speaking for months, Catherine took her back to her house the second she saw her again. Jackie let out a deep breath as she stared out the window, her eyes beginning to fill with tears, \"I guess I'm really not worth it.\" Catherine's eyes skimmed the tables as she entered the restaurant. \"Good afternoon, can I help you?\" asked the hostess. \"I'm supposed to be meeting two of my frien-\" before she could finish she heard, \"Catherine! Over here!\" \"Nevermind\" Catherine laughed to the Hostess. \"Oh my god!\" Her old college friend Kelly, said as she got up from her chair and hugged Catherine. \"You are absolutely gorgeous, it's not fair.\" Catherine smiled and kissed her friend on the cheek as her other friend Jenny made her way over. \"Seriously woman, what is your secret other than not having children?\" Jenny laughed. \"It's so good to see you.\" \"It's so good to see you both as well, now stop. You both look stunning as always. How are you girls?\" Kelly went first of course, \"I'm great! Jacob is about to graduate pre-K which is breaking my heart and Tyler just finished the first grade.\" Here we go, Catherine thought to herself. She loves her friends and she loves children, but absolutely loathed when women couldn't carry on a conversation without talking about their kids. \"Aw, it seems like they were just in diapers\" Catherine responded, forcing the words from her mouth. \"What about you Jenny? How's teaching going?\" \"It's great! I switched to Junior high this year which most people found crazy, but I really enjoy it. I feel like I've been able to really connect with the kids for the most part. What about you? Are you still teaching at Bloomington?\" \"No, I quit last year. I needed a change of pace and have been really getting into more of the research side of Psychology.\" \"Oh wow! Good for you! I can't believe you got to speak at Stanford, you must be doing really well for yourself. I'm sorry we missed it, how did it go?\" Jenny asked. \"Really well, I'm glad I got to do it and hopefully I get more opportunities like that.\" \"Sooo... Catherine, have you found yourself a man yet?\" Kelly asked, winking. Catherine laughed, \"No, not yet.\" Here we go again, she thought. If there's one thing she learned from being single in her early-thirties, it was that other people her age only knew how to talk about two things: When you planned on getting married and when you planned on having babies. \"Oh come on, give us married girls some juice. And please, don't hold back.\" Kelly nagged on. \"I'm not holding anything back. There was someone last year but it didn't end well, so I've just been concentrating on my work.\" \"There we have it! Didn't end well? Sounds like you really like this person. Was he maybe \"The One.\" \"Kelly!\" Jenny hissed. \"Maybe Catherine doesn't want to talk about it.\" \"It's fine Jenny. Yes, they meant a lot me. I've never felt that way about someone before. You know me, I don't let people in very easily. But it could never work so I'm moving past it.\" Catherine wished she felt as confident about what she had just said as much as she made herself sound. \"Why can't it work? Is he married? Oh my god he's married isn't he?!\" Kelly burst in excitement. Clearly this woman needed to lay off the Daytime Soaps and get out into the real world. \"No, not married. He came to Bloomington from California but then took a job back out here last summer.\" Catherine didn't bother correcting the He to a She. She wasn't ashamed of dating other women, but didn't feel like diving into that conversation with Kelly. \"I'm so sorry, Catherine.\" Jenny placed a hand on top of her's. \"So you haven't spoken to him since he left?\" \"Funny you should say that. He actually flew in and surprised me at Stanford last night.\" \"What!? What happened!\" cried Kelly. Catherine realized she was Kelly's form of entertainment for the next hour, whether she wanted to be or not. \"Nothing juicy, we just talked and caught up all night.\" \"Why on earth are you here with us right now then?\" Jenny asked. \"Sh.. He\" Catherine caught herself, \"Had to catch a flight back to LA this morning for work.\" \"Hold on a second.. This man that you say may be 'The One,' hopped on a flight to come see you for a few hours and NOTHING happened?! \" Kelly was losing her housewife mind. \"Did you realize he might not be in the one after all?\" Jenny was always the more down to earth one. \"No, I realized the exact opposite. I fell in love all over again and was even invited back to LA, but I just can't let myself fall back into that. We still live on opposite sides of the country and I don't want to deal with that pain again.\" \"Catherine excuse my French but you are dumb as hell,\" Kelly said bluntly. \"This person is crazy about you. Probably more so than you are about him, considering he caught a flight just to see you, and you are throwing it all away because you live in a town all the way across the country that you no longer have ties to?\" \"I hate to say this but she's right.\" Jenny looked at her sympathetically. \"I know it's hard for you to leave Bloomington considering everything that happened with your parents, but you have a real shot at happiness here.\" Catherine sat there absorbing everything her friends were saying. Why was she so heartbroken. They were right. Jackie found the time in her insanely busy schedule to FLY to where she was, just to see her speak at Stanford. Sure the speech was a big deal to anyone who had written a research article, but Jackie was a movie star with a giant blockbuster movie being released. She had much bigger and better things going on in her world. When Catherine came back to reality she saw Jenny and Kelly staring at her smiling. \"I'm sorry ladies, but I've got somewhere to be\" she smiled. \"Both girls jumped out of their seats and hugged her, \"Go on! Get out of here!\"[Chapter 6] Catherine decided she wanted to return the favor and surprise Jackie. The problem was, she didn't know where Jackie lived and didn't know anyone else to help her. She decided she'd have to get creative. She dialed Jackie's number but there wasn't an answer, she figured she was in her interviews so sent a text. \"Hey Jackie, my airline called to tell me I now have a layover in LA tomorrow instead of a direct flight. Maybe I can take you up on that offer after all?\" Catherine didn't waste time waiting for Jackie to respond. She called the airlines right away to find the next flight to LA. There was one at 5pm that night. After checking out of her hotel early, she headed to the airport. Jackie didn't get out of her interviews until after 6pm. She was completely drained from the day. From Catherine, to the traveling, to faking a cheery exterior and putting on her best act for the interviews, she was ready to drown herself in a bottle of wine and crash. When she got into the car, she checked her messages and saw Catherine's missed call and text. She wasn't sure how to feel. She was excited to see Catherine again, but she was really hurting and wasn't sure if she could handle it. \"Hey Catherine, yes I live fairly close to the airport. What time do you land?\" When the car pulled up to her apartment, Jackie mumbled a thanks to the driver and made her way upstairs. The first thing she did when opening the door was go straight to the wine rack and crack open a bottle, not even bothering with a glass. She decided to take a bath to help relieve some of the stress. She grabbed another bottle \"one for the road\" she mumbled to herself, starting to feel the affect of the wine. Once the plane had landed Catherine eagerly turned on her phone, seeing if Jackie responded. Her face lit up when she saw the message. After reading Jackie's text, she realized she was going to have be a little more blunt to try and get her address out of her. \"Tomorrow morning, what's your address? Maybe we can meet up near you?\" Catherine exited the plane and headed to baggage claim. She still hadn't heard from Jackie. She decided she'd give her 20 more minutes then call her. As she was waiting for her bags, she kept glancing down at her phone impatiently. Still nothing. After she finally found her bags she dialed Jackie's number. No answer. Maybe she should have thought this whole thing out more. Jackie's phone rang on the kitchen counter. Currently, she was a bottle and a half deep in wine, and the warm bath wasn't slowing down her drunkenness. After she finished the second bottle and started to become dizzy, she decided it was time to get out of the tub. As she was getting out she slipped and hit her head on the door, \"FUUCKKK!\" She screamed. She looked in the mirror and saw the red mass starting to raise on her forehead. Oh great she thought. \"Nothing a little more wine can't fix.\" Jackie headed to the kitchen to get another bottle but was deeply upset when she discovered she was out. She saw her phone on the counter and concentrated closely as she texted. \"Hey there, you should come over ;) and bring wine please.\" \"Be there in 30 ;)\" Catherine still didn't hear from Jackie and wasn't sure what to do. She tried calling her one last time. Jackie's phone starting ringing, she picked it up without looking \"Are you almost here?\" \"Huh? No my flight doesn't land until the morning\" Catherine was confused, wondering if Jackie somehow knew she was in LA. \"Oh, Catherine, hey sorry I thought you were someone else.\" Jackie was slurring her words. \"Jackie are you okay? You don't sound well.\" \"Yeah, I'm just really tired.\" \"Oh I'm sorry for bothering you. You didn't answer my text so I thought I'd try calling. My plane lands in the morning and I was wondering what your address was so we can meet up.\" It was taking all Jackie had to act sober enough to talk to Catherine. \"I can send a car for you so you don't have to waste cab fair, just let me know what time your plane lands.\" Send a car? She wasn't going to come herself? Catherine tried not to read into it and said, \"No that's okay, I don't mind. You seem really tired and I don't want you having to wake up early just for me. I'll come to you. After everything you did for me I owe it to you.\" \"Fine.\" Jackie didn't feel like arguing. Her head was already throbbing from hitting it, and the wine wasn't helping either. She slowly told Catherine her address, mostly because she had to concentrate really hard, but thankfully Catherine just thought it was for her own sake since she was writing it down. \"Got it! See you tomorrow Jackie! I'll call you when I land.\" \"Goodnight Catherine.\" Catherine debated whether she should wait until the morning to surprise Jackie since she seemed so exhausted. Screw it, she couldn't wait any longer and didn't know how much time she had with her. She caught a cab and handed them Jackie's address. Jackie woke up to a knock at her door. Her head was spinning. She stumbled to the door and opened it. \"Tommy!\" She shouted. She gave him a giant hug then grabbed the bottle of wine from his hand. \"Whoa Jackie, are you okay?\" Tommy looked at Jackie, who was wearing nothing but her bath robe. He watched her open the wine and start chugging it straight from the bottle. He quickly intervened, grabbing it from her hands. \"Easy there tiger.\" When Jackie turned around to grab the bottle back from him he saw the giant knot on her head. \"Jackie what happened?!\" She slapped his hand away and said, \"Nothing, I'm fine. I just stumbled and caught myself with my forehead.\" She laughed then started to chug the bottle again. He grabbed it back from her, \"I think you've had enough for tonight.\" Jackie struggled with him for the bottle. \"Jackie, tomorrow is your off day. You know you don't want to waste it hungover and no offense, but you are already in rare form.\" All of a sudden Jackie burst into tears. He pulled her close to him telling her it'd be okay. \"No it won't!\" Jackie cried, \"I'm not worth it!\" Tommy grabbed a dish cloth and wrapped it around some ice then took Jackie to the couch. \"Here\" he said, while pressing the ice to her forehead. \"What happened\" \"My heart hurts, my head hurts, everything hurts.\" \"Where do you keep your aspirin? Your head doesn't look so good.\" Between sobs, Jackie managed to tell him they were in the master bathroom. While he was gone, a knock was on the door. Confused, Jackie stumbled to the door and looked through the peep hole. What in the hell, she thought. Catherine was standing outside of her door. She knocked again. Jackie didn't know what to do, but she knew she couldn't leave her out there forever. Finally, after the third knock she opened the door. \"Hi Porcupine!\" Catherine's excited expression immediately turned to concern when she saw Jackie's face. \"Jackie, what's wrong?!\" She took Jackie into her arms. Just then Tommy came out from Jackie's bedroom.[Chapter 7] Catherine's heart dropped into her stomach. She released her grasp from Jackie. \"Uh, hey, I'm Tommy.\" Jackie felt herself about to be sick and ran to the bathroom. Tommy was in the kitchen getting a glass of water when he looked back at Catherine. \"She's pretty messed up right now.\" Catherine couldn't help but notice how comfortable Tommy looked in Jackie's apartment. She wondered if Jackie was lying to her about them not being an item. \"Are you friends with Jacks?\" \"Uh, yeah. I'm visiting from Bloomington.\" Catherine replied, with a confused face. \"Oh cool! Well listen, I know a broken heart is something girls help each other out with, so I'm gonna leave you to it.\" He handed the bottle of aspirin and glass of water to Catherine. \"Could you tell her I said bye? I'm not good with vomit.\" Before Catherine could say a word Tommy was gone and she stood there frozen, holding the glass of water and aspirin. Did Jackie and Tommy have a fight? Did he mention something about a broken heart? Why was Jackie wearing a bathrobe? She pulled her luggage in from the hall and gently closed the door, still trying to wrap her mind around what she just walked into. Catherine slowly made her way to the bathroom. She could see Jackie lying on the floor through the crack, so gently pushed it open. Jackie's elbows were resting on the toilet seat, one of her hands was holding her head up, covering her eye and exposing the knot on her forehead. \"Jackie? Are you okay?\" Jackie looked up, embarrassed. \"I'll live.\" \"Here, take some aspirin.\" Catherine removed two pills from the bottle and handed them, with the glass of water, to Jackie. Jackie leaned backwards and sat on the floor. \"Come here so I can take a look at that head.\" Catherine closed the toilet seat, making sure not to look inside, and flushed it. She patted her hand on the lid for Jackie to come sit. Jackie struggled getting up and once she was on her feet, she lost her balance and almost fell into the bathtub. Catherine took hold of her shoulders and sat her down. She grabbed a towel and ran cool water over it. After wringing it out, she sat on the side of the tub. She grabbed Jackie's chin to turn her face towards her. Catherine winced at the sight of it, \"Ouch, what happened?\" \"I tripped and hit it on the wall,\" Jackie slurred. Catherine looked at her suspiciously, \"You know that's what abuse victims say. Did something happen between you and Tommy?\" \"What? No! Tommy wouldn't hurt a fly. This was all me, he wasn't even here when it happened.\" Catherine was relieved to hear this since she had just let him walk past her, out the door. \"So when did you take up drinking?\" Catherine asked. \"About one week after I moved here. Stress and depression go great with California wine,\" Jackie drunkenly laughed at herself. Catherine couldn't help to smile but this new discovery worried her a bit. \"You know, me mending your face is starting to become a routine.\" Jackie let a tiny smile escape her lips. \"This is embarrassing. What are you doing here anyway?\" Since she wasn't sure what was going on, Catherine didn't want to reveal that she had completely changed her travel plans, so simply stated, \"I caught an earlier flight and thought I would surprise you. Clearly this wasn't my best idea.\" Jackie flinched as Catherine examined her forehead. \"Sorry!\" Catherine apologized. Jackie closed her eyes, she couldn't face Catherine like this. Suddenly she felt her dabbing at her eyes, wiping her make up off that had run down her cheeks. It took everything inside of her not to start crying again. Catherine could see Jackie's face twitching, fighting the urge to cry, so she decided to give her a minute. \"Let me go get you some fresh ice.\" As soon as Catherine left, Jackie slowly got up and brushed her teeth. As she was coming out of the bathroom Catherine walked toward her, ice in hand. \"Here, keep this pressed on your head for a while, it'll keep the swelling down.\" \"Thanks\" Jackie said softly. \"Are you going to tell me what's going on?\" Catherine asked, trying not to pry. \"Don't worry about it\" Jackie said, being somewhat short with her. \"Are you mad at me or something? Just say the words and I can go get a hotel.\" \"Just give me a minute, okay?\" Jackie went into her bedroom and closed the door. She collapsed on her bed and buried her face into the pillow. She starting sobbing uncontrollably and hoped Catherine couldn't hear. Catherine was sitting on the couch when she started to hear Jackie's muffled cries. She wasn't sure what Jackie was going through, but thought it was best to give her some space and check into a hotel room. She headed back toward Jackie's room and softly knocked on the door. \"Jackie? Can I come in?\" \"Please Catherine, just give me a minute\" Jackie said while trying to disguise her crying. Catherine gently opened the door. She sat on Jackie's bed and began rubbing her back. \"Jackie I think it's best that I go check into a hotel. You clearly need some time to yourself and I don't want to burden you. Can you just tell me you'll be okay if I leave you? I don't want you falling and hurting yourself again.\" \"I'll be fine.\" Catherine bent down and kissed Jackie on the back of the head. \"I'm sorry you're hurting Porcupine. You know, I do have mob connections and can have whoever did this to you killed\" she teased. Just then Jackie realized that Catherine had no idea this was all the result of her. Catherine must had thought Jackie was dealing with a heartbreak caused by someone else, probably Tommy given the way it looked tonight. \"Catherine?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You don't have a hotel room do you?\" \"No, but it's no trouble. I'm sure I can find one\" \"Stop, you're staying here.\" Jackie sat up and wiped her tears. \"I'm sorry I'm not the best company tonight, but I'm not going to send you into the streets of LA at 10 o' clock at night with nowhere to go.\" \"Are you sure?\" Suddenly Jackie felt a million times better, minus the humiliation... And pounding head. \"Yes. Let me get my hot mess of a self together and I'll be out in a second. Are you hungry? We can order take in.\" \"Starving.\" Catherine replied. Jackie put on some clothes. She was mortified that both Tommy and Catherine had seen her like this. She went into the bathroom and washed her face, then applied some make up to help even out the swollen forehead and puffy eyes. After leaning her head back she began to spin again, she was still pretty hammered. Once she felt somewhat more put together, she grabbed the ice off of the sink and went into the living room to join Catherine. She flashed her a smile then slumped down on the couch and stuck the ice on her head. \"Good to go?\" Catherine asked, sounding half concerned and half joking. \"The room is still spinning and my head is pounding, but I'll make do. I guess you don't have to feel self conscious about this morning anymore. Jokes on me now, huh?\" \"Whatever, you could be wearing a paper bag and still look fucking gorgeous.\" Catherine laughed. Jackie took off the ice and looked at Catherine, who then winked at her. She started to laugh then winced in pain \"Oww\" she cried. \"Wade and Matt are going to kill meeee\" she whined as she carefully patted her forehead. \"Matt is your new manager I assume?\" \"Yes. Shit! Food. Sorry. I'll go get the menus\" Catherine placed her hand on Jackie's arm, \"Let me. Just tell me where they are.\" After ordering food, Catherine got Jackie a glass of water. \"You should probably drink as much of this as you can, or you're going to feel even worse tomorrow.\" \"Good idea. Can we just start this night over and pretend you just got here?\" \"No, but we can try. I guess we won't be visiting any wineries tomorrow, huh?\" \"You're lucky I'm not hungover yet, or I would be vomiting in your lap right now.\" \"That's attractive. How many glasses did you have anyway?\" \"Two and a half bottles...\" \"Two and a half BOTTLES?! Jesus Christ Jackie!\" \"I know, I know. Trust me, my head is reminder enough of how bad of an idea it was.\" \"Speaking of...\" Catherine got up and refilled Jackie's ice. She came around the back of the couch, leaned Jackie's head back and gently laid the ice on the bump. \"On for 20, off for 15.\" As Jackie placed her hand on the ice, her fingers brushed Catherine's. She then placed her hand directly on top of Catherine's. Looking into her eyes she said \"Yes, Professor Stark.\" Catherine bent down and whispered in Jackie's ear, \"Good girl.\" As she began to lift her head back up, Jackie let go and moved her hands to Catherine's face, pulling her closer. Catherine grabbed Jackie's hands and pulled them away. \"Jackie, you're drunk\" she whispered. Thankfully the buzzer rang to avoid an awkward moment, the food was here. Jackie was only able to eat a few bites. She disappeared into the back and was gone almost 15 minutes before Catherine finally came to check on her. She found Jackie curled up on her bed, looking adorable as ever. She pulled the blankets up over her, kissed the top of her head and whispered, \"Sweet dreams Porcupine.\" As she turned off the light she noticed the ice on the pillow. When she went to grab it Jackie sleepily turned over and grabbed her arm. \"Catherine... Stay.\" Catherine climbed over Jackie and laid next to her, gently caressing her arm. Jackie's heavy eyes opened slightly as she whispered, \"I miss you\" before drifting back to sleep.[Chapter 8] Jackie squinted her eyes at the brightness that had consumed her bedroom. She had a headache, but it wasn't as bad as she expected. She looked next to her and saw Catherine sleeping. Jackie smiled at the sight of her in her bed, wishing she could wake up to her every morning again. She quietly got out of bed and made her way to the bathroom to take some more aspirin. What she really needed, was to go for a run to sweat out all of the alcohol. Since Catherine was still sleeping, she decided that's what she'd do so she didn't feel miserable the rest of the day. She quietly went back into her bedroom to change into her running gear. As she was getting changed, Catherine sleepily rose from the bed, \"Where are you going?\" \"Sorry! I didn't mean to wake you. I'm going for a run to sweat out this hangover. I'll pick up some breakfast on the way home, go back to sleep\" she whispered. \"No, I want to come. Do you mind?\" \"Of course not.\" \"I only brought one running shirt and I already wore it. Do you mind if I borrow a shirt again?\" \"Yeah no problem, I actually have something perfect for you\" Jackie smirked. She shuffled through her drawers before finally pulling out a blue t shirt. She held it up and smiled. \"My lacrosse shirt! I've been looking for that forever! You stole it?!\" \"I didn't mean to. I wore it home one day and then, well... You decided to sleep with a man in front of me so I never really had the chance to return it.\" Catherine made an oops face, \"Sorry.\" \"You should be. I would have burned it but I liked it too much.\" Jackie smiled as she threw the shirt at Catherine. I'll be in the kitchen when you're ready. Jackie was stretching in the living room when Catherine came out. Catherine secretly bent her head to check out Jackie from behind before joining her. Those training sessions were really showing. Catherine started stretching her legs when she paused to reach out and poke Jackie, hard, making her lose balance and fall. Jackie stood up and pushed Catherine, \"You bastard!\" Catherine starting laughing uncontrollably. \"What?! I didn't do anything! You're obviously still drunk and lost your ability to balance.\" \"Whatever, jerk.\" \"Expect me to give you plenty of hell today for being so hungover,\" Catherine beamed. \"Only if you can keep up!\" With that, Jackie returned the favor and pushed Catherine back down before opening the door and running down the steps. Catherine ran after her. After a fifteen minute jog, Jackie led her to a gorgeous park. Once they got to the top Jackie slowed down to show Catherine the view. You could see all of LA. \"It's gorgeous!\" Catherine said. \"Much better than Bloomington, huh?\" Jackie teased. \"I won't argue with that\" Catherine replied. Jackie offered Catherine a sip from her hydration pack. Catherine scrunched her face, \"You brushed your teeth right?\" \"I hate you.\" Catherine laughed as she grabbed the pack from Jackie. \"As much as I'd love to take in this view we should probably head back, our time is limited. What time is your flight anyway?\" \"10 p.m., red eye.\" As they were making their way down the mountain it began to sprinkle, by the time they hit the street it was an all out down pour. \"Shit! Shit! Shit!\" Jackie was screaming as she ran. \"Come on Professor Stark! Keep up the pace!\" \"Not everyone has a fancy personal trainer you know!\" Catherine yelled at Jackie. \"Oh and here I thought It was your age\" she yelled back. With that Catherine ran as fast as she could, passing Jackie. They were one block from Jackie's apartment. Catherine reached the door first, \"Ha! I win!\" \"Not so fast, we're not in my apartment yet!\" Jackie slid the key in the door then burst through it, running up the steps. Catherine grabbed her arm, pulling her back. They wrestled on the steps as Jackie tried blocking her. Catherine stole the key from Jackie's hand and jumped over her. She unlocked the door and covered it with her body as Jackie tried to sneak in. Jackie backed up then slid through her legs. Catherine pounced on top of her. \"I won!\" Proclaimed Jackie. \"I don't think so! I'm taller and winning by an arm's length!\" \"That's not fair! I'm vertically challenged!\" Jackie squirmed under Catherine until she was completely flipped around. She began tickling Catherine, so she had no choice but to retreat her arms to stop the torture. \"Winner!\" Jackie laughed. They were hysterically laughing and breathing heavily, both out of breath. Suddenly their laughing slowed as they looked directly into one another's eyes. Catherine brushed the hair out of Jackie's face and gently touched the knot on her forehead. \"How's your head?\" She asked before gently kissing it. \"Suddenly it stopped hurting\" Jackie replied. Catherine's lips were so close to Jackie's that they brushed against her's whenever she spoke. \"That's good she said\" her warm breath on Jackie's lips. Jackie wasn't going to make the first move, she tried last night and was shut down, so the ball was in Catherine's court whether this went any further. Catherine smiled and looked down, \"your heart is beating so fast.\" \"We just raced 3 miles\" Jackie replied. \"Oh that's the only reason, is it?\" \"Yu-u-p.\" Jackie over pronounced the word so that her lips would brush Catherine's. That was enough to push Catherine over the line. She bent down and grabbed Jackie's bottom lip with her teeth, gently nibbling before she let go. Jackie closed her eyes and sucked in the lip that Catherine had just released. \"Don't forget to Breathe\" Catherine smiled. \"It's hard to when I'm around you\" Jackie said, her face becoming serious as she looked deep into Catherine's eyes. \"Catherine..\" \"Yes?\" Catherine moaned, before leaning down to kiss Jackie on the neck. Jackie swallowed so hard that Catherine could hear it. \"I love you.\"[Chapter 9] Catherine suddenly got up and ran to the bathroom. She turned on the shower then sat on the tub and began crying. Jackie laid on the floor where Catherine had left her, confused. She got up and headed to the bathroom. Pressing her ear to the door, she heard the shower running. Seriously? This was the third time in two days that Catherine had shot her down each time she put her heart on the line. Fed up, Jackie grabbed her keys from the floor and walked out the door. A street down from her apartment was a small coffee shop she frequented often. It was still pouring down rain but Jackie didn't care. She slowly walked to the coffee shop, allowing the rain to pour over her. Once she arrived, she realized she couldn't walk in soaking wet, so she just kept on going. Catherine let the warm water run down her face. She took her time in the shower, not knowing how to face Jackie. When she finally got the courage to open the door, she headed to the bedroom to get dressed. It was silent in the apartment. She slowly walked into the living room and didn't see Jackie. She looked around but Jackie was nowhere to be found. Assuming she went to go get food, Catherine went back to the bathroom to finish getting ready. Jackie was now a mile away from her apartment but still didn't stop, she was so angry that she physically couldn't stop moving. She wanted more than anything to be with Catherine but she was at her breaking point. Catherine was the one who told her she wasn't worth it. Catherine was the one who mocked her when she called them a couple. Catherine was the one who cheated on her, right in front of her face. All of the shitty things Catherine did and Jackie continued to always be there for her, like a fucking lap dog. Why was she allowing Catherine to have this hold over her? She wasn't some sex slave to be kept locked up in Catherine's house. She was a Hollywood actress, with a summer blockbuster movie about to hit theaters. She deserved better and finally started to realize that just because Catherine was her first love, it didn't mean they'd be together for ever. Most people didn't end up with their first loves. She decided to see Catherine as just a stepping stone, who helped build her confidence back up enough to get her to return to Hollywood. Jackie finally started to feel better. That's it, she thought. I'm done with Catherine Stark once and for all. Catherine was sitting on the couch as she glanced at the clock. Jackie had been gone for 2 hours. She began to worry and dialed Jackie's number. No answer. She decided to go pack her bags to try to stop from worrying, maybe Jackie just needed a little time. Jackie's phone rang, it was Catherine. She hit ignore. She was on her way back but didn't want to give Catherine the satisfaction of knowing that. Catherine heard the door close, a few seconds later Jackie was standing in the bedroom doorway. \"Did you catch an earlier flight?\" Jackie's face was stone cold. \"No, I was worried about you, and sitting around doing nothing wasn't helping. Do you want me to catch an earlier flight?\" Catherine nervously asked. \"No use now, it'd be pointless to waste the money moving it just a few hours. I'm going to take a shower.\" Before Catherine could get a word out, Jackie disappeared into the bathroom. Catherine could tell Jackie wasn't happy with her. She didn't seem sad though, just angry. Catherine was kicking herself for responding the way she did when Jackie told her she loved her. She had been waiting for her to say those three words for nearly two years, and now she completely blew it. That's what Catherine did though. Fight or flight, and she always chose flight. Great, now she was psychoanalyzing herself. She sat on the bed trying to figure out how she was going to fix this. She heard the shower shut off. Jackie came back into the bedroom wearing nothing but a towel. She made her way over to the dresser and started slipping on her panties underneath it. Catherine's heart ached at the sight of Jackie hiding from her. \"I don't know about you, but I'm starving\" Jackie said with her back still to Catherine. \"I could eat.\" Catherine responded. Jackie dropped the towel as soon as she had her bra on. She walked over to her closet to find something to wear. Catherine stood up and wrapped her arms around Jackie's waist. Jackie quickly grabbed a hold of her arms and pushed them off of her. \"Catherine, don't.\" \"Jackie, I'm so sorry.\" \"For which part Catherine?\" Jackie whipped around. Catherine sat back down on the bed after seeing the anger in Jackie's eyes. \"For telling me I wasn't worth it? For cheating on me, not even having the decency to wait until I was out of the house? But oh... That's right... You completely disregarded the fact that we were even in a relationship. So I guess it wasn't technically cheating, was it?.\" Catherine opened her mouth to talk but Jackie continued on while violently putting on a shirt and jeans. \"Or are you sorry for shutting me down when I tried to kiss you, even though you've been coming on to me for the last two days? Oh, and let's not forget you literally running out on me when I finally told you that I loved you.\" Catherine's eyes filled with tears. She was well aware of all of the awful things she has done to Jackie, but hearing her list them all out made her realize what a terrible person she was. \"All of it,\" she said ashamed. \"I'm sorry for all of it.\" Jackie just stared at her expressionless with her arms crossed. \"I'm well aware of the person I am. I put up walls and run away when I feel vulnerable.\" \"Are you expecting me to feel bad for you? I know you've had a tough life Catherine. I've talked to you about it plenty of times, because I genuinely care. But I'm sick of being your punching bag and your toy you throw away once I've finished quenching your needs. Do you realize this is the first time since you've known me that you've ever apologized? I'm a person too Catherine.\" \"Jackie there's not a day that goes by that I don't feel the guilt of hurting you the way I did, but you hurt me too. The first opportunity to go back to LA that came your way you jumped on, even though we were getting pretty serious. It's like I didn't even mean anything to you.\" \"Do you know how nervous I was to tell you about the audition? It was all I could think about for two days. When I finally did, it didn't even seem to affect you. You even told me I should do it, without any sort of hesitation. Then, when I got back, it's like you turned into an entirely different person. You didn't even pick me up from the airport. It's like you were relieved that I would be leaving so you could move on to your next girl.\" \"You have it entirely wrong Jackie. I was completely heartbroken when you told me, but I was trying to be supportive because I never saw your face light up as much as it did when you talked about acting. I agree, I changed when you came back. I was scared and I put my walls up because I saw you making a life outside of us, and knew I couldn't be a part of it. It's something I struggle with and am trying to overcome which is why I came to LA. I wanted to make it up to you, but it's clearly not going as planned.\" Jackie stared at the floor silently for a few moments before responding. \"It doesn't matter anymore,\" she said quietly. \"I should actually thank you. After what you did this morning, I had an epiphany. You were my first love but it's time to be an adult and let you go. This relationship or whatever it is between us is toxic. I would say I regret this entire weekend, but I don't because it's given me the closure I need to finally move on.\" The words stung Catherine. All she wanted to do was take Jackie in her arms and tell her how much she wanted to be with her. She didn't want to lose Jackie again but after hearing how badly she had hurt her, she just wanted her to be happy, even if that didn't include her. \"Now can we finally move on and go get some lunch. We still have a little time left to not let this day be a total bust.\" Catherine looked up at Jackie from the bed and shook her head yes, with a small smile. Jackie held out her hands to help Catherine stand up then hugged her. \"I'm glad we finally resolved all of this.\" Catherine was choking back the tears but managed to get out a, \"Me too.\" \"Ugh!\" Jackie let out a huge moan. \"I feel so much lighter and better don't you?!\" \"Yeah,\" Catherine laughed, hiding her pain. The two hopped in Jackie's car and made their way to her favorite Italian restaurant. \"Screw it, I'm getting pasta,\" Jackie said. Catherine raised an eyebrow as she looked at her. \"Leave me alone, I don't have a red carpet dress I have to squeeze into for a few days, and I deserve it.\" They spent the rest of dinner making small talk and friendly jabs at one another. Apparently they could be friends, or at least Jackie could. By the time they got back to Jackie's it was nearly 7 o'clock. \"We should probably head to the airport in an hour or so, LAX can be pretty crowded regardless of the time.\" \"Okay, I'm going to go finish packing.\" Catherine said, as she made her way back into Jackie's bedroom. She quietly shut the door and got out her phone. Catherine had lied to Jackie, she didn't have a flight tonight because she had hoped her and Jackie would have rekindled things by now. She dialed the airlines, hoping something was available. Right as the they picked up, Jackie had walked back to the bathroom and heard Catherine on the phone. She froze in the hallway trying to hear. \"Hi, I was wondering if you had any flights back to Indianapolis tonight? The last one left already? Oh, well what's the soonest one available? 6 a.m. tomorrow? Okay I'll take it.\" After Catherine gave them her information she asked to be transferred to the airport hotel. \"Hi, I was would like to book a room for this evening.\" As soon as she hung up she heard Jackie open the door. \"What was that all about?\" Jackie asked confused. \"Nothing, I was just confirming if my flight was on time.\" \"And is it?\" Jackie asked, testing her. \"Yep. 10 p.m. sharp.\" Catherine said with her back turned to Jackie, hunched over her suitcase. \"Catherine you're lying to me. I heard you book a flight for 6 a.m. tomorrow and a hotel room for tonight.\" Catherine was silent. \"What's going on?\" Jackie grabbed Catherine's arm turning her around. Her face had tears streaming down it and her lip was quivering. Jackie took Catherine's face in her hands, she didn't understand what was happening and had never seen Catherine so upset before. \"I lied about my flight. I never had a layover here. After you left Stanford I realized how much I wanted you back in my life, so I hopped on the first flight here to try and win you back.\" Jackie stared at her but said nothing, she was speechless. So that's why she showed up so early. Catherine grabbed her hands and removed them from her face. \"It's okay Jackie. I don't want you to feel bad, I just want you to be happy. You are right, we aren't healthy for each other. Please just know that I never meant to hurt you, and I honestly wish the best for you.\" Catherine kissed her on the cheek then grabbed her suitcase. Jackie was paralyzed, standing in her bedroom. Her mind was spinning from what Catherine had just said. The sound of the door made her snap back into reality. The woman she loved just told her everything she had ever wanted to hear, and now she was leaving, thinking Jackie didn't feel the same. She grabbed her keys and shoes and stumbled out the door trying to put them on. When she finally got down to the street she saw Catherine close the door to a cab. Panicking, she ran as fast as she could to her car and headed to the airport. Traffic was a mess as it usually was in LA, which was making her more frantic than she already was. When she finally got to the hotel she pulled up to the valet to save time. She quickly handed him the keys and took her ticket. She ran to the front desk and asked if Catherine Stark had checked in yet. \"I'm sorry Ma'am but I can't tell you that information.\" \"Please,\" she pleaded. \"It's an emergency.\" The receptionist motioned her head to the elevators. She looked over and saw Catherine getting into one. \"Catherine!\" She shouted, but was too late. The door had closed. She looked up to see what floor it was going to, 3, thank God. Jackie ran up the steps and got there just as Catherine disappeared behind the door. After taking a minute to catch her breath, Jackie gently knocked on the door. \"Catherine... Please let me in.\" Silence. She knocked again, pleading. Still nothing. Jackie realized it was going to take a little more convincing to get Catherine to open the door. \"Catherine. Remember how upset I was last night? It was because of you. I secretly had purchased two tickets back here, one for me and one for you, so I was really depressed when I ended up back here alone. Looks like we both had the same idea in mind for how this weekend was going to end.\" She said softly, as she brushed her fingers against the door. After a few moments, Catherine slowly opened the door. She stood there for a minute then let out a deep breath and shrugged her shoulders as to say, now what? Jackie offered a slight smile. \"Am I really toxic?\" Catherine asked, with a heartbroken face. \"Am I really not worth it?\" Jackie answered with a question. Catherine's eyes filled with tears again. \"That's the problem Porcupine, you are the only one who has ever been worth it.\" Jackie pushed open the door and pulled Catherine into her arms. When they slowly broke their embrace, Catherine cupped Jackie's neck with her hands then kissed her deeply, with a passion that she never fully let herself release before. Jackie started moving Catherine towards the bed. When they got to the edge Jackie stepped back slightly and reached for the bottom of Catherine's shirt, gently tugging it up over her head.\"You're so beautiful,\" she whispered before kissing her again. Without breaking their kiss, Jackie gently laid Catherine down on the bed as she straddled her. Catherine grabbed Jackie's shirt, slowly pulling it up over her head. Jackie then leaned forward and put her hands down on the bed, hovering over Catherine. \"I'm scared,\" Catherine whispered, as a single tear rolled down her cheek. Jackie could feel Catherine's heart racing against her own chest as she lay on top of her. She brought her hand up to Catherine's face and wiped away the tear then placed her hand over Catherine's heart. \"Don't be\" she whispered, then leaned down and kissed Catherine.[Chapter 10] Catherine slowly opened her eyes, remembering where she was. She rolled over and saw Jackie curled up next to her. The sight of her made her wonder why she ever let her go in the first place. Catherine could feel the giant smile expanding across her face. She couldn't believe how perfect last night was. Jackie looked so peaceful but she couldn't help herself, she leaned in and gently kissed her forehead. Jackie cracked her eyes open and smiled. \"Good Morning Gorgeous,\" she said. Catherine softly tucked Jackie's hair behind her ear. \"I love you\" she said, tilting her head. Jackie smiled then leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. Catherine took her hand and intertwined their fingers. \"I know you're probably self conscious about last night, 'cause I know you...\" Jackie grinned, \"So we don't have to talk about it, but just know that I love you, and am well aware of how hard it was for you to be that vulnerable. I didn't take it lightly.\" Catherine offered a sincere smile, letting her know she was right and appreciated it. Jackie lifted her hand up and kissed it. \"I'm glad you know that's not going to happen often,\" Catherine smiled smugly. \"I prefer to keep quiet.\" Jackie started laughing \"What?\" \"Quiet is not the word I would use to describe you. Especially after last night.\" Catherine started laughing and pulled the sheet over her face, embarrassed. \"Some people are just more vocal when they're enjoying something. And you're the one to blame anyway!\" Jackie pulled the sheet down, \"Don't hide, I like it\" she grinned. \"What? Now that we've bared our souls to each other, we can't give each other hell anymore?\" \"Absolutely not, that will never change.\" Catherine said sternly, it was what she enjoyed most about their relationship. Jackie's phone started vibrating on the nightstand. \"You might want to get that, It's been going off nonstop since last night.\" \"I don't want to!\" She groaned. \"I just want to stay in bed with my girlfriend all day,\" she said as she rolled over into Catherine's arms. \"Girlfriend?\" Catherine repeated, stunned by the word. \"Yeah. Do you have a problem with that?\" Jackie raised her eyebrows smiling. \"No. Say it again.\" Catherine said while staring at Jackie's lips. \"Girl-friend\" Jackie repeated slowly. \"That sounds sexy\" Catherine said as she rolled on top of Jackie. \"Again?! You're going to kill me Professor Stark!\" Catherine came out of the bathroom and saw Jackie curled up sleeping. \"Every single time,\" she laughed to herself. Thinking how Jackie falls asleep after sex no matter what time of the day it is. She guessed she should take it as a compliment. She heard Jackie's phone vibrate again so went over and got it. 12 missed calls, 8 voice mails and 17 text messages. Catherine crawled into bed next to her and rubbed her cheek with the back her finger. \"Catherine, I love you but I need rest,\" Jackie mumbled without even opening her eyes. She laughed, \"I don't want that, well yes I do... But you need to wake up. You have a ridiculous amount of missed calls and messages. As much as I don't want to let you leave this bed, you have a job waiting for you.\" \"Fine\" she groaned. She lifted herself up on her elbows and took her phone from Catherine. Matt was yelling so loud on the other end of the phone that Jackie had to pull it away from her ear. \"Matt, I know. I'm sorry. I really don't feel well this morning, I was up all night getting sick\" she glanced at Catherine and winked. \"Yeah I think I have one of those 24 hours bugs that's going around... Yes, I promise I will be there tomorrow. 11 a.m sharp.\" As soon as she hung up with Matt she dropped her face into the pillow then whimpered \"Oww.\" She lifted her head up and dabbed at the knot, forgetting it was there. Catherine leaned over to get a closer look at it, \"How's the head? It looks like the swelling has gone down a bit.\" \"Still hurts. Kiss it to make it better?\" She plead, flashing Catherine a pouty lip. Catherine smiled at her pitiful face, then gently kissed the bump. \"So what was that all about, what did you miss?\" \"An audition.\" \"Jackie!\" Catherine flashed her a stern look, the last thing she wanted was to negatively affect her career. \"Not you too,\" she groaned. \"I'm sorry, but it was the last thing on my mind during round 4... Or was it 5?\" Jackie paused while counting on her fingers, mumbling to herself. \"I lost count. Anyway, the last thing on my mind was some stupid audition.\" \"As flattered as I am, it's still your career Jackie, and it's important.\" As serious as Catherine was, her voice suddenly lightened when she fully processed what Jackie had said, \"and it was 4, but 5 sounds like a good idea.\" She teased. \"Later of course though,\" she ended in her stern professor tone. Jackie smiled then leaned over and kissed her. She turned to lay on her back and stared up at the ceiling. Catherine moved over, setting her head on Jackie's chest and they laid there for a good while in complete silence. Catherine's mind was moving a mile a minute, thinking about everything that had happened yesterday. \"Are you happy?\" She asked. \"I've never been happier\" Jackie responded, almost immediately. \"Are you sure?\" \"Of course I am. Why, what's up?\" \"Nothing, you were just pretty set on being over me yesterday so I just want to make sure this is what you really want.\" Catherine was feeling completely vulnerable, but couldn't help bring up what Jackie said to her yesterday. The words had been resonating inside of her since. Jackie scooted her body up until she was sitting, causing Catherine's head to slide down into her lap. She looked down into Catherine's eyes while she played with her hair, \"Catherine I was hurting. I thought you didn't want me, so I was trying my best to convince myself that I was better off without you. Why do you think I was gone for so long? As I recall, you did the same last year.\" Catherine stared up at her, knowing she was right, and offered a small smile. \"Now stop this talk, we are both crazy about each other and we're not going to fight it anymore.\" \"I'm sorry, it's just we still have so much to figure out, like the fact that we still live 2,000 miles apar-\" Before Catherine could finish Jackie put a finger over her lips. \"Shhh... Let's just enjoy the day. Now how about that round 5?\" Jackie said, before bending down and kissing Catherine. Jackie started gathering her clothes that were scattered all over the floor, \"It's getting late, we need to check out soon.\" \"Okay I'm going to get a quick shower,\" Catherine said as she rolled out of bed. Jackie grabbed her arm and pulled her towards her. \"No, just wait and we can shower at my place.\" She pulled her in close, cupping Catherine's neck with her hand and kissed her. \"I like that idea, but we need to talk eventually too. I need to get back home to Ethan and figure out what my next move will be.\" There were so many things they needed to work out, and as much as she wanted to enjoy the moment, Catherine couldn't with all of the familiar issues they were keeping at bay. \"I know, I know. Can you at least stay one more day?\" Jackie plead. \"I think I can manage that\" she smiled. When they got back to Jackie's, Catherine called the airlines to reschedule her flight for the following day, and the dog sitter to make sure she could watch Ethan for one more night. As soon as she said goodbye she felt Jackie take the phone out of her hand and set it on the counter. Jackie's arms reached around her waist as she began kissing her neck. \"Now how about that shower?\" As they were getting dressed, Catherine asked Jackie what her schedule was like for the day. \"I have a meeting with Wade at 3, maybe you could come with me and we can get a bite to eat after?\" \"Sounds good to me. So when are we going to have that conversation? You tend to use sex to distract me anytime I bring it up.\" Catherine knew she was nagging, but wasn't going to let her keep putting this off. \"Since when do you complain about sex?\" Jackie's puzzled face was quite amusing. Catherine laughed, \"I'm not, trust me. I just feel like your avoiding the elephant in the room... And using my weakness against me.\" She flashed Jackie a look. \"Ok, let's talk\" They both sat on the bed in silence, waiting for the other to speak. \"I don't know what to say,\" Jackie said breaking the silence. \"I can come to Bloomington when I have time off, but you didn't seem to think that would work last time.\" Catherine hesitated before revealing to Jackie what she had been brainstorming in her head all weekend, \"I've actually been thinking about applying for jobs here in California. I haven't stopped thinking about it since I met with my friends for lunch the other day. They made me realize there's nothing for me in Bloomington anymore, and I need to stop letting that house hold me back. I'm not sure I'll be able to find something right here in LA, but we could at least be in the same state. I guess once I get a job I'll put my house on the market and-\" \"What?! No you are not!\" Jackie interrupted. \"I'm not what?\" Catherine asked, confused. \"You're not selling your house Catherine! I could never let you do that. It means way too much to you. It means way too much to me .\" \"Jackie I can't just have an empty house sitting in Bloomington, nor can I afford it.\" \"Then you'll rent it out or I'll help you with it, but you're certainly not selling it.\" As much as Jackie's reaction was making her fall even more in love with her, she knew she needed to start learning how to let go. \"It's time for me to move on with my life. Sacrifices are going to have to be made for us to work, and you're an LA based actress. There's no way around that.\" Jackie moved over to where Catherine was sitting. \"Catherine we're only going to make necessary sacrifices. I want us both to be happy and I only want you to move to California if you find a job here that you love. Just because I'm an actress in LA doesn't mean all of my roles will be here, we can make it work. First and foremost you need to decide what you want to do with your career and we'll make do in the mean time.\" Catherine couldn't believe how mature and selfless Jackie was being. \"You're right. I guess I have some soul searching to do.\" \"Yes you do,\" Jackie smiled and kissed her cheek. \"Now let's get ready so Wade doesn't get even more mad at me.\" Jackie couldn't believe Catherine was willing to give up her entire life in Bloomington to come be with her. She felt guilty hiding things from Catherine, but she didn't want to cause unnecessary stress and ruin how happy they were until she knew it was a for sure thing. She would know soon enough.[Chapter 11] They pulled up to the agency with plenty of time to spare, thankfully. Wade was a stickler when it came to being punctual. Jackie had Catherine wait in the sitting area while she went back to Wade's office. After a few minutes, Catherine grew bored so began catching up on her email. She had a few emails from some of the staff at Stanford asking if they could pass along her information. She began to grow excited, hoping this meant people wanted to work with her. As soon as she got home she would have to start polishing up her resume, she thought. About an hour later Jackie came out and got her, \"Sorry it took so long! Wade wants to meet you.\" They walked down a hall way lined with framed photos of actors and before Catherine could ask Jackie what she should say, they entered Wade's office. He was sitting behind his desk typing on his computer with a bluetooth headset clipped on his ear. He looked exactly like she imaged a talent agent would look. \"Wade this is Catherine. Catherine, Wade.\" \"So this is the famous Catherine from Bloomington,\" he said as he stood up and shook her hand. She shot Jackie a look, not knowing how much she had told him. \"That's scary\" she laughed. \"No, I've only heard great things. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thanks for taking care of our little star while she was in Bloomington.\" \"It was my pleasure,\" Catherine replied with a smile, glancing back at Jackie. \"Alright well we're out of here, we have dinner plans to get to. Bye Wade.\" Jackie said, rushing Catherine out the door. As they were leaving Wade called Jackie's name. \"Jackie, think hard about this, the Neptune movie was pure luck. Don't let your career disappear again, because it may be more permanent this time.\" \"I will.\" Jackie said as she closed the door. Catherine was curious as to what he meant and wondered why Jackie rushed her out the door so quickly. \"So that's Wade. What all does he know about me?\" \"Just that you're my close friend from Bloomington, who helped me out a lot last year.\" \"What was he talking about, not letting your career disappear?\" \"The audition I missed today, he wasn't too happy. Sorry I made you wait so long, I didn't think he'd lay it into me that hard.\" Catherine could tell Jackie was hiding something by the way she was being so short with her. \"Sounds like a pretty important audition. What's it for?\" \"We'll talk about it later, let's go get some dinner first.\" Jackie seemed distracted at dinner. She hardly even looked at Catherine the entire time, and kept spacing out. Catherine could tell something serious was up but didn't want to keep prying. She was acting the exact same way she did before telling her about the Neptune movie. \"You okay, Porcupine?\" \"Yeah, I'm sorry.\" She smiled. \"So what do you want to do since its your last night?\" \"It doesn't matter, we can just go back to your place. I don't mind.\" \"Don't be silly, let's do something fun. It seems like we've spent the last three days locked inside.\" She almost made it sound like she was bored with her. Catherine continued to wonder what was causing this sudden shift in her demeanor. \"You pick.\" Jackie paid for their meal after having to basically tear the bill out of Catherine's hand. It felt good having someone take care of her for a change, she thought. As they were leaving the restaurant Catherine grabbed hold of Jackie's hand but Jackie quickly dropped it. \"Catherine,\" she looked around, \"We can't.\" Catherine was starting to get agitated and was wondering what was going on, she wanted answers. Obviously something happened in that office. They silently waited for the valet to bring Jackie's car around. As soon as they got in, Catherine couldn't bear it any longer. \"Jackie, is something the matter? I don't want to keep prying but you've seemed different since leaving Wade's office, hostile almost.\" \"Hostile? How am I being hostile to you?\" \"You introduced me to Wade for about 5 seconds before literally pushing me out the door, you hardly paid attention to me at dinner, then when I tried to hold your hand you shooed me away.\" \"Catherine you know I'm not public about any of this yet. Don't take it personally, I just have to be careful when we're out.\" Catherine suddenly began to feel a familiar feeling, the one she felt after the Neptune party when Jackie introduced her as her college friend, then ignored her all night. Was this how it was going to be if she moved here? Jackie looked over and saw Catherine staring out the window. \"Hey\" she said softly, as she reached over and grabbed Catherine's hand. \"I love you.\" \"Is that enough?\" Catherine quietly sighed. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" As soon as Jackie uttered those words, Catherine felt the déjà vu kick in to their big fight. She thought it best to stop before things got out of hand again. \"Nothing.\" Jackie turned up a hill and drove down a secluded path. Catherine looked around confused, \"Is this the part in the story where you kill me and dump my body? I know I don't have a family, but the dog sitter would at least report me missing I would hope.\" Jackie laughed then parked the car. \"Come on.\" She walked over to Catherine's side of the car, took her by the arm, and led her to a picnic table that looked over the city. Jackie climbed up and sat on top of the table and motioned Catherine to come sit in between her legs on the bench. She hesitated then sat down. Jackie put her arms around her shoulders and kissed her cheek. She felt Catherine's body tense up. \"Hey…What is it?\" Jackie asked, turning her chin to face her. \"You tell me.\" \"Well I do need to tell you something but there's obviously something that's bothering you, so I'd rather we fix that first.\" Silence. Catherine was trying her hardest not to explode. \"Catherine...?\" She couldn't keep it in any longer, \"I just didn't realize we would have to hide out again. I didn't know Wade and Matt didn't even know about me.\" \"I know, I'm sorry. It's just not something I ever got around to telling them. You were out of my life by the time I started working with them, so it never really came up.\" \"Is this how it's going to be if I move out here? I can't touch you anytime we're in public or around anyone you know? We have to pretend we're just friends?\" Jackie was silent, she didn't know what to say. Catherine stood up and faced her. \"Well?\" \"I-I don't know. This all happened so quickly that I haven't really had the chance to think about it.\" Catherine threw her hands up, \"That's just great,\" she sarcastically laughed. \"This is exactly why I kept trying to get us to talk. So what else did you have to tell me?\" Jackie was terrified. Catherine was already furious and she knew telling her the details of her audition might drive her away again. \"I don't know if this is a good time.\" \"No, if you have something to say, then say it. I don't want any more surprises.\" Jackie stayed silent, nervously playing with her hands. \"Out with it!\" \"Catherine how can you be so cruel to me after the last 24 hours we just spent together?\" Jackie's voice began to crack. As terrible as she felt hearing Jackie's reaction, her own anxiety was taking control of her. \"Because those 24 hours are going to make it even harder to walk away from this, if we aren't completely open this time around.\" \"Can you please just calm down first? You're extremely intimidating when you're mad and this isn't the way I wanted to tell you.\" Catherine just stared at her, not saying a word. She knew she was right but she couldn't help her temper, or fear. \"Okay. The truth is I missed that audition today on purpose. It's a really big role and would be great for my career but I'd have to leave the country for at least 5 months, and I'm not sure I'm willing to do that.\" Jackie was too afraid to look up. She felt her throat tighten and tried to fight the tears but couldn't. When she could no longer wipe them away fast enough, she gave up and covered her eyes with her hands. Catherine was so angry and hurt, but she hadn't seen Jackie cry this hard since she had gotten in that fight with her mom last Thanksgiving. Maybe she had been a little too hard on her. \"I'm so sorry Catherine. A few days ago we weren't even in each other's lives any more. Now here we are, and I want nothing more than to be with you, but I don't have the answers to all of your questions.\" Catherine realized she was right. She couldn't expect her to have it all figured out when they had just gotten back together last night. \"How is it possible that our student/teacher affair seems so petty now. It turns out that was the least of our worries,\" Catherine said, while running one hand through her hair as the other rested on her hip. She looked down at Jackie who still had her head down. She slowly made her way over to her and knelt down on the bench in front of her. She lifted Jackie's chin up and looked her in the eyes. They were filled with tears and Catherine felt awful for putting so much pressure on her. \"I'm sorry, you're right. It's not fair of me to think you had this all figured out. I was just hoping one of us did.\" \"What are we going to do Catherine?\" \"Well you are going to go to that audition tomorrow and nail it.\" She smiled. \"Okay?\" \"But, I don't want to lose you again.\" \"Jackie, what happened to not having to make sacrifices? I'm not letting you turn down this role for me.\" \"Five months is a really long time, especially without you. I would rather sacrifice the movie than you. I know you wouldn't get on a flight that long and I wouldn't be able to come back here.\" \"For you I would,\" she smiled. Catherine stood up, \"But I'm not traveling across the world for just a friend.\" Jackie wrapped her arms around Catherine's waist. \"Please just don't give up on me again.\" Catherine's heart broke at the words. She kissed her on the head before sitting next to her. \"This is what we're going to do. I'm going to go back to Bloomington and figure out what I'm going to do with my career. And you… You're going to go to that audition tomorrow, and any others that come your way, and you're going to decide how you want me in your life. But Jackie, I can't sneak around anymore. I did it for so long and it did nothing but cause damage. I just can't live life like that anymore, it's not healthy. I want to be able to kiss you in the middle of the street and spend my life with you.\" \"I know, I want that too, so badly.\" The two sat there on the table, trying to enjoy the sunset but they had too much on their minds. After what felt like an eternity of silence, Jackie finally spoke. \"I wish we were back in Bloomington. Do you know what I miss the most?\" \"What?\" \"Walking down the hallways, knowing at any second I could be pulled into a classroom and be completely ravaged by you.\" She laughed. Catherine laughed, \"Yes, I miss that too. Very much,\" she said, bumping her shoulder into Jackie's. \"Can't we just go back to this morning when everything was perfect?\" \"I wish, but this is reality.\" \"Reality sucks.\" Catherine thought about what Jackie said, how new and exciting things were when they were in Bloomington. Their relationship had always been so hot and heavy. Just then she got an idea in her head as she looked around. \"You know, it doesn't have to…\" Jackie looked over at Catherine and scrunched her forehead. Catherine slid closer to her with a smirk on her face. She took Jackie's face in her hands and began kissing her slowly. Her lips slid over to Jackie's cheek, then down her neck, and before she knew it, Catherine's hand slipped down her pants. \"Catherine! We can't, we're in a park. We could get arrested for this!\" Catherine laughed as she looked around, \"There's no one here, we'll see the headlights if anyone does show up, now relax. I thought you missed this?\" Screw it, Jackie thought. She put both hands on Catherine's face and began kissing her, deeply. She moaned quietly as Catherine pleasured her. Jackie draped one arm over Catherine and grasped her shoulder, digging her fingers into it. Catherine leaned her face into Jackie's, smiling, then proceeded to kiss her neck. Jackie breathed heavily into her ear, \"Catherine I'm about to…\" Catherine stopped, \"No you're not. Not yet...\" she said as she quickly pushed Jackie down onto the table. She climbed on top of her, kissing her neck down to her stomach, then began removing her pants. \"Catherine!\" \"Shh... trust me,\" She smiled. When she finished, Catherine laid down next to her on the table. \"Jesus Christ,\" Jackie said, putting her hand on her forehead. \"You needed that\" Catherine laughed. \"We needed that,\" she responded, as she leaned over and gave her a kiss. They both stared up at the stars in silence for a while before Jackie turned over and faced Catherine. \"What am I going to do here without you?\" \"Well you lasted a year without me here already, I'm sure you can survive a little longer,\" she said as she tucked a piece of hair behind Jackie's ear. \"Yeah, but we also didn't have the last three days that we just had. I can't just erase that from my mind.\" \"After what I just did, you better not be able to erase it from your mind,\" she teased. Just then they saw headlights coming up the path, Jackie quickly got up from the table. \"Come on, let's get back to my place.\" Jackie parked the car and her and Catherine slowly walked down the street towards her apartment. \"Do you want to stop and get some wine? I'm fresh out at my house\" she said, flashing Catherine a guilty smile. \"I'm not sure I trust leaving you with wine in your house,\" Catherine teased. \"Plus you have that big audition tomorrow.\" \"How about coffee or ice cream? My favorite coffee spot down the street has both.\" \"Sure,\" she said. \"Okay, come on.\" Jackie said, taking her hand. Catherine was in shock, looking down at their hands. But as soon as Jackie reached the door she let go. \"Hi Jackie!\" The girl from behind the counter greeted her. \"Hi Sarah, how are you?\" \"Good! I'm shocked to see you here.\" \"Yeah, I sure have been busy! Sarah, this is my friend Catherine.\" There's that word again, Catherine thought. She knew she needed to be patient with this though. \"Hi Catherine, it's nice to meet you! I like your necklace!\" \"Oh, thanks!\" Catherine said, reaching up and touching her necklace. She wasn't use to people being so friendly to her, especially since most of the people in Bloomington were petrified of her. It was refreshing. \"After they received their drinks they continued on their way back to Jackie's. \"Are you mad?\" Jackie asked. \"Why would I be mad?\" \"Because I introduced you as my friend again.\" \"It stings, but I understand. I wasn't exactly telling my colleagues about you back in Bloomington.\" Jackie was becoming paranoid ever since her talk with Catherine. She was scared she was going to lose her. She needed to prove to her that she was serious. As they were approaching an alley Jackie stopped, she grabbed Catherine's arm and pulled her into it. \"What are you doin-\" Before she could finish, Jackie kissed her. \"Who are you?\" she smiled. Jackie just smiled back, grabbed the coffee out of her hand, then pushed her against the brick wall. She began kissing down her neck when someone yelled, \"Get a room!\" from the sidewalk. \"Jackie, people can see.\" \"I don't care,\" she smiled as she placed her hand behind Catherine's neck. Catherine just stared into her eyes before saying, \"Let's go back to your place now.\" Jackie bent down and picked up their cups, then held her arm out for Catherine to grab hold. \"Are you sure?\" \"I've never been more sure, and we're only a block away. Baby steps right?\"[Chapter 12] Jackie walked straight to the couch and plopped down in exhaustion. \"I'm going to go change,\" Catherine said as she started making her way back to the bedroom. Jackie got up and grabbed her arm \"Not so fast,\" she said, pulling her onto the couch. \"Just lay with me here for a little while first.\" They cuddled in each others' arms for few minutes in silence, before Catherine looked over and saw Jackie staring up at the ceiling. \"What's on your mind Porcupine?\" \"You.\" She said, without hesitation. \"Good answer\" Catherine smiled. \"Good rhyme\" Jackie teased. \"Don't you need to prepare for your audition tomorrow?\" \"Should I? Yes. Do I want to? No.\" \"Come on, I'll help you. I owe you for helping me with my speech.\" Catherine said as she began pulling her up. Jackie didn't want to, she just wanted to spend as much time as possible with Catherine before she left. \"You know I'm going to bug you until you go get that script.\" Jackie stood up, groaning. \"Fiiine. God! Why do you always have to make me do better!\" She sarcastically yelled as she pouted her way back to the bedroom. Catherine laughed, she knew things would be rough between them if Jackie got this role, but she knew Jackie would eventually regret it if she passed up this opportunity. She would have to try to her best to hide her insecurities this time around. Jackie made her way back to the living room, dragging her feet, script in hand. \"Oh, poor baby. So what's this one about?\" \"Sci-fi again, go figure. It's one of those books they're making into a trilogy.\" \"Oh wow, is it a big part?\" \"Not the lead, but a regular. I would have to sign on for all three films.\" Panic began to set in. Catherine had no idea the role was this major. Instead of exposing her shock, she tried her best to project it onto Jackie. \"How are you not freaking out about this, Jackie? This is a big deal.\" \"You know why. And honestly, I'd rather do something I'm passionate about. But since I've only played Tyler, I'm stuck in this typecast. I shouldn't complain though because I'd have consistent work for 3-5 years, which is an actors dream. \"No you shouldn't. And your typecast isn't a bad thing when the genre you've been pushed into is huge right now.\" \"Yeah I know, I sound like a spoiled brat.\" Catherine could tell Jackie was holding back on this role, and knew a lot of it had to do with her. In order to get her excited about it, she knew she had to be supportive. \"Well let's try it out.\" As they ran lines, Catherine kept thinking how she was always so attracted to Jackie when seeing her act. She was always so reserved and quiet, but whenever she was acting she became confident and sure of herself. They continued to read through it until Jackie no longer needed to look at the script. She then threw it on the table and they proceeded to relax again on the couch. \"Did you ever dream this would happen again?\" Jackie asked, rubbing her thumb over Catherine's hand. \"Us?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Dreamt of it? Of course I did. But honestly, I thought I'd never see you again after that day.\" \"I didn't either. Then you came crawling back.\" Jackie said, cracking a smile that extended across her face. \"What!? Excuse me, but you were the one to make the first move. Plenty of them, actually.\" Catherine said defensively, smiling. \"Keep dreaming!\" Jackie yelled, \"You texted me first. You started all of this!\" \"I was keeping it casual and friendly. I was just being a nice person.\" Catherine stated, defending her ego. \"And the jealousy about Tommy?\" \"I wasn't jealous, you guys made a cute couple,\" She smiled sarcastically. \"America seems to think so,\" Jackie said, rolling her eyes. \"So they really think you guys are together?\" \"We've never said we are, but yes they all assume.\" \"And were you?\" Catherine wasn't going to admit it, but she began to feel jealous. \"Not like that, we just kept each other company a few times.\" \"Kept each other company?\" \"Do you really want the gritty details?\" \"No, that explains why he seemed so comfortable here though.\" Catherine suddenly put two and two together. \"Wait, so if I wouldn't have shown up here that night…\" \"Maybe, but I just wanted more wine and knew he'd come.\" \"Ah\" Catherine said. \"Why are we talking about this?\" Jackie asked, \"Next subject please.\" \"I told you, we need to be completely honest this time.\" \"Okay, fine. I'll play this game. How many were there then? And I want a number this time.\" Catherine gave her a look. She didn't want to get into this again. \"Go on,\" Jackie said, waiting for a response, smirking. \"How many students?\" Catherine asked, trying to kill time. \"Yes.\" \"Six.\" \"Including me?\" \"Seven.\" Jackie just looked at her with her eyes brows raised. She was expecting no more than 4, so was a little taken aback. Catherine didn't say anything else. She could sense Jackie wasn't finished with this conversation. \"So what really happened with them then? That's a lot of students to disappear.\" \"They didn't disappear. Whenever I felt them getting too serious I would end it, they'd transfer to a different class, and I'd never seem them again. People just assumed and made up rumors.\" \"Catherine Stark, heart breaker\" Jackie laughed as she jokingly punched Catherine in the shoulder. \"They weren't exactly my shining moments\" Catherine said, looking somewhat ashamed. \"We all have things we're not proud of. Come on, let's go to bed. Enough honesty for the night.\" Jackie said, slapping Catherine's knee. When Jackie came out of the bathroom, Catherine was sound asleep. She was half tempted to wake her since this was their last night together, but decided not to since they didn't get much sleep the previous night. Instead, she crawled into bed and curled up next to her. Jackie opened her eyes, she saw it beginning to lighten outside. Morning was coming and the thought of Catherine leaving made her nauseous. She was tired but didn't want to sleep away the last bit of time they had. Catherine was still asleep, so she quietly got out of bed and headed to the kitchen. She got out a piece of paper, and decided to write Catherine a little note for the plane ride to ease her anxiety. When she was finished, she snuck back into the bedroom and hid it in Catherine's bag before crawling back in bed next to her. Catherine woke up as she felt Jackie rustle behind her. She noticed the sun beginning to rise through the window, she couldn't believe it was morning already. She turned around to face Jackie, \"When did I fall asleep?\" \"As soon as you laid down.\" \"I'm sorry.\" Catherine was disappointed that she wasted their last night together. \"It's okay. It was a long day and we didn't get much sleep the night before.\" She winked. \"True.\" Catherine smiled. \"What time is it?\" Jackie turned to look at the clock, \"6:30.\" \"Good, we have a little time.\" \"I need to call Mike to let him know what time to get us, is 8:30 good?\" \"Yeah, you don't need to do that though, I can catch a cab.\" \"Don't be silly, my audition isn't until 11, I have plenty of time.\" Jackie called her driver Mike, to arrange for him to pick them up. Then turned around and laid back down next to Catherine. \"When am I going to see you again?\" She asked, avoiding eye contact. \"That's up to you. I'm the jobless one. However, some of my connections at Stanford did email me though, asking if they can pass along my information. So, maybe I'll have some interviews out here soon.\" \"That's great news!\" Jackie said, as she rolled over and grabbed her phone from the nightstand. She pulled up her calendar and scrolled through it. \"I have to go to Canada this weekend, but maybe I can arrange to stop through Bloomington sometime soon.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, I'll have to talk to Wade and Matt and see when I have a few days off.\" Catherine smiled, \"I'd love that.\" The idea of Jackie back in Bloomington made her face light up. \"Oh, no. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to see you. I meant to see my main man Ethan. I guess I could squeeze in a little time for you though.\" \"Oh you could, could you?\" Catherine rolled over and pinned Jackie beneath her. \"You're so violent! Ethan is a much better nurturer,\" Jackie said, playfully grinning. \"Shut up,\" Catherine laughed before she bent down to kiss her. They both took their time, not knowing when the next would be. Apparently too much time because when Catherine glanced at the clock is was after 8. \"Shit! Jackie it's 8:07!\" \"What?!\" Jackie ran to the bathroom to take a quick shower then tried making herself presentable, as Catherine showered and got ready as well. Mike was knocking at the door at 8:30 sharp. \"Catherine can you get that please? Just give him your bags and let him know we'll be down soon.\" \"Sure, no problem.\" When Catherine came back, she saw Jackie frantically putting on make up. She wrapped her arms around her, \"It's okay, calm down.\" \"No I can't, we need to get out of here! Please just give me a second to finish up.\" \"Okay, sorry. What can I do to help?\" \"Nothing, just be ready to go\" Jackie stood up and hurried to her closet as Catherine walked out of the room, it was clear she needed her space. Jackie threw her clothes on as fast as she could and checked herself out in the mirror before scrambling through the apartment, looking for the script. \"Catherine do you know where my script is?!\" She was standing by the door holding up the script smiling. \"Here you go, I grabbed some waters and granola bars from the kitchen too. Are you good to go?\" Jackie walked towards her relieved. She hugged her tight, \"I'm sorry for snapping at you. Thanks so much. You're the best.\" \"Don't be sorry, just relax.\" Catherine said, as she tucked Jackie's hair behind her ear. Jackie smiled at the gesture, she always loved when Catherine did that. \"Hurry back here, I need you\" she said, then kissed her before they made their way down to the car. Traffic was bumper to bumper. Catherine's flight was leaving in an hour and they were still at least 25 minutes away. \"As much as I'd love for you to miss your flight and stay here, I think the airlines would kill you if they had to reschedule again.\" \"Yeah, no kidding. I think the dog sitter would kill me first though.\" When they finally got to the airport Catherine turned to Jackie, \"I guess I'll see you when I see you?\" She said as she leaned in for a kiss. Jackie interrupted her \"I'll walk you in.\" They entered the airport together but kept their distance, as they were walking to the check in line a couple of preteens recognized Jackie and approached her for a picture. \"Sure!\" She said, as she began to make small talk with them. All of a sudden more and more people started to come over until she finally had to leave the line. She looked over at Catherine with pain in her eyes, \"I'm so sorry\" she mouthed to her. Before she knew it, a mob of people were surrounding her. \"Hi everyone, I'm sorry but I'm in a hurry.\" Her driver noticed the commotion and came in to help. \"Mike, I really need to say goodbye to Catherine in privacy.\" \"Miss Kirk, I don't think you're going to be able to here. Why don't you have her meet you back in the car?\" Jackie saw Catherine finish checking in and tried making eye contact with her. When she finally looked her way she pointed to her phone. She texted her, asking her to meet her back in the car. Jackie parted through the crowd and made her way back into the vehicle. Catherine also proceeded to make her way over, but there were too many people surrounding it now and she couldn't get through. She didn't have much time since they were already late to the airport, so she called Jackie. \"Catherine, where are you?\" \"I can't get through, there's too many people.\" \"Hold on, Mike is going to come get you.\" \"Jackie as much as I want to, I can't or I'll miss my flight.\" \"Catherine please...\" \"I'm sorry...Thanks so much for the last few days, they were amazing. Good luck at your audition, let me know how it goes.\" \"This is not how I wanted to end this weekend. I love you.\" \"I know, this is your world now though. I love you too Porcupine. Talk to you soon.\" As Jackie's car pulled away from the airport, she couldn't shake the feeling that this weekend could have possibly been just a one time thing with Catherine. She already told her she couldn't deal with the sneaking around, so the fact that they couldn't even say goodbye to each other was probably the last straw for her. She didn't even get to kiss her goodbye. Feeling terrible Jackie sent her a text, \"I'm so sorry, please forgive me. Have a safe flight back and call me when you land. I love you. P.S. Check the front pocket of your bag xoxo.\" I don't know if I can live like this, Catherine thought to herself, as soon as she was seated on the plane. As much as she wanted to be with Jackie, especially after this weekend, she wasn't sure if she could handle this lifestyle. Jackie was noticed back in Bloomington, but was still able to live a normal life. She had been out of the spot light for 5 years, so no one made too big a deal over her. Here she was a movie star, and it would only get worse if she got this new role. When Catherine went to turn off her phone for the flight, she saw Jackie's text. She checked her bag and found the note. She knew Jackie felt guilty and didn't want her going into her audition upset. \"It's okay, I promise. Go crush that interview! Found the note, will read it during my flight :) Love you too Porcupine! xoxo.\" Catherine opened the letter. Jackie joked about the plane, trying to ease her anxiety, but then went on to completely expose her feelings for her. When Catherine finished it, she felt guilty about having doubts. She put the letter away and closed her eyes the rest of the flight, her mind heavy with decisions she would need to make about her future. Jackie sat in the waiting room nervously tapping her fingers on the chair. She just wanted this audition to be over with, her anxiety levels were through the roof. \"Jacqueline Kirk? They're ready for you.\" She stood up and made her way into the room. As she was reading her lines, tears began forming behind her eyes. This a nightmare, she thought. When she was done, the entire panel was silent. She apologized but the casting director replied, \"don't apologize, that was great!\" Jackie was shocked, she assumed they thought she was a basket case. \"Thanks so much Jacqueline, we'll be in touch.\" Jackie smiled and shook their hands, as she thanked them for their time. As soon as she got to the car she told Mike to drive to Wade's office. She took out her phone and dialed. \"Wade, I need to meet with you and Matt ASAP. I'm on my way to your office.\" When she got to the Agency, Jackie walked straight into his office. \"Jackie, what's going on? How was the audition?\" \"It was great but that's not why I'm here. Is Matt coming?\" \"He couldn't make it so he's going to conference in.\" \"Okay, call him.\" Wade looked at her both confused and suspicious, as he dialed Matt's number. \"Hey Matt, Jackie's here.\" \"Hey Jackie, what's going on\" \"I have to tell you guys something that you're probably not going to like.\" \"Okay...\" \"I didn't go to Stanford to see an old friend, and I didn't blow off my audition yesterday because I was sick. I went to see my ex-girlfriend. Before you ask, I don't exactly classify myself as a lesbian, but I fell in love with a woman and she isn't just some stage I'm going through. I've experimented before and this is much more. She also happens to be ten years older than me, and a college professor who lost her job over our relationship back in Bloomington.\" Wade and Matt were both silent so Jackie continued to ramble on. \"I know this is a PR nightmare, but I don't care. Because the truth is, I've been absolutely miserable this past year without her, and I'd rather give up this entire career than hide her or be without her. Also, don't schedule anything after the Vancouver premiere this weekend, I'm stopping in Bloomington on the way back.\" Wade just sat there staring at Jackie, and Matt was silent on the phone. Finally, Matt broke the silence. \"Well this is quite the news. First off, I'm completely okay with this, but are you telling me you want to come out? Because I've got to tell you, I'm not sure that's a good idea with the audition you just went on. It could skew their opinion of you. Not to mention you and Tommy are a hot item right now in the press.\" \"I don't want to announce anything, I just want to be able to hold my girlfriends hand in public.\" \"Can you tell me more about this Bloomington scandal? And why is this the first time I'm hearing about it?\" Asked Wade, slightly angry. \"Because it wasn't made public. The head of the department is a family friend of hers, so he just asked her to resign rather than firing her. He didn't release the details to the public and shredded the photos.\" \"Photos?!\" \"They aren't incriminating. Some paparazzi followed me to her house one day, and it just shows me going inside.\" \"Jackie, you know as soon as they hear her name they're going to figure this all out and leak the story,\" Wade said. \"I don't want her name released, I don't even want you guys to confirm it if they do find out. If they figure it out on their own, so be it. She didn't ask for this life and I damaged her career enough. Okay?\" \"Yeah, okay. But they'll still eventually find out once they start digging, it's their job to.\" Wade warned. \"I still need more of this story, every detail please,\" Matt said. \"It's not as bad as it sounds. She was a Psychology professor but she didn't teach any of the classes I took.\" \"Okay, that's somewhat of a relief, but this is still going to cause an uproar.\" \"Yeah I know. That's why this is the first you're hearing of it.\" \"First and foremost, we need to schedule a meeting with PR to figure this whole thing out. And I really have to press that this may ruin your chance of getting that role, so think hard about it\" Matt said. \"I want her to be a part of the PR meeting, this affects her too\" said Jackie. \"Yeah of course, this needs to happen sooner than later though,\" Matt said. \"I know, I'll talk to her and get back with you.\" \"Alright Matt, we'll talk to you later to get this set up,\" Wade held a finger up to Jackie motioning her to stay for a minute. He just stared at her before a sly smile slowly appeared on his face, \"It's Catherine, isn't it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Nice choice\" he winked. \"I think so too,\" she smiled. \"You know I support you 100% but Matt's right, this could affect the movie so think hard about what can and cannot wait.\" \"I promise you I will. Thanks again Wade.\" When Jackie got back in the car she looked at the time and figured Catherine would have called by now. She didn't want to bombard her, especially after that letter, so decided to clean her apartment to kill some time. An hour and a half later and Catherine still didn't call. She began to worry so texted her, no answer. Jackie headed down to the store a couple of blocks away from her apartment. She grabbed two bottles of wine, she knew Catherine wouldn't approve but she needed to ease the anxiety she was feeling. When she got back to her apartment Catherine still hadn't texted her back, so Jackie decided it was time to call. She called twice, letting the phone ring until it went to voice mail both times, then opened up the first bottle of wine.[Chapter 13] Catherine looked out the window and saw the sun beaming down on Indiana. Life was so much slower and simpler here. As much as she already missed Jackie, she couldn't wait to get home to Ethan and her quiet life. Once the plane landed she got out her phone and noticed her battery was almost dead. She called the dog sitter, letting her know she was on her way home from the airport. After she hung up she went to call Jackie but her phone died. It was about an hour drive from the airport in Indianapolis to Bloomington, so she had plenty of time to think about the past week; about Jackie, about Stanford, about everything. When she finally got home, she thanked the dog sitter and apologized for staying longer than planned, giving her an extra tip. She then went upstairs to charge her phone and shower off her long day of travel. After unpacking and starting a load of laundry, Catherine retrieved her phone and saw 3 missed calls, two from Jackie and one from an unknown number. She checked her voice mail and it was the dean of the Psychology department at Stanford, thanking her for speaking. Catherine's hopes were let down a little, she thought maybe they were calling to offer her a job. Feeling down, she dialed Jackie knowing she could make her feel better. \"Catherine! Are you okay?!\" Jackie sounded frazzled. \"Yes, I'm sorry my phone died. How was your audition?\" \"I thought I bombed it but they seemed to like me, so we'll see. How was your flight?\" \"I'm sure you did great. My flight was fine.\" Catherine didn't seem like her usual spunky self. \"Is everything alright?\" Jackie asked. \"I'm just a little down. I had a voice mail from Stanford so got my hopes up about a job, but they were just calling to thank me.\" \"Aw, I'm sorry Catherine. It's only been a few days though, I'm sure you'll hear something soon.\" \"Yeah, I'm hoping so.\" Hoping to cheer her up a little, Jackie decided to share the details about her meeting. \"Well, I have two things that might cheer you up.\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yup. I talked to Wade and Matt today.\" \"About what?\" \"You.\" \"Oh really?\" Catherine sounded intrigued. \"Yeah. They know all about you now, and what happened in Bloomington.\" \"And what was their reaction?\" Jackie told her everything that was discussed in her meeting with Wade and Matt. When she was done she didn't hear anything on the other end of the phone. \"Catherine, are you there?\" \"Yeah, sorry it's just a lot to take in.\" \"I know, I'm sorry.\" \"I just never really thought about how much this could affect me. I didn't even think about my termination getting exposed like that, it's kind of scary since I'm in the process of trying to find a job.\" Jackie felt her stomach drop. Catherine's reaction wasn't exactly what she had hoped for. She was wondering if Catherine was having second thoughts now that she had a glimpse of what she was getting into. \"I know. I told them I never want your name to be released and we want to keep you as private as possible.\" \"Thanks for that.\" \"Catherine, are you okay about all of this? I did it because I thought it's what you wanted, but we can move as slow as you want. I'll do whatever you want.\" Jackie was nervous to hear her answer. Catherine hesitated before speaking again, she could tell her reaction hurt Jackie but she had her career to think about. \"Maybe we should just keep it low key until I get a job, at least.\" \"Okay, I completely understand. So...\" Jackie paused for a moment, \"I was planning on coming to Bloomington on my way home from Canada. Should I not?\" \"What? You were? No, of course I want you to come!\" Catherine felt bad that Jackie was under the impression that she didn't want to see her. \"Jackie, I'm sorry about my mood. It's been a long day. I really want to see you, that's enough to cheer me up.\" \"You're fine. I've just been a mess all day after everything that happened this morning, then my audition and meeting. I was a little nervous that you got scared away.\" Catherine decided it was probably best to get off of the phone before causing any more stress to Jackie. She did love her, but her mind was spinning. \"I'm still here, Porcupine. We both obviously just had rough days. Why don't we go get some sleep and start fresh tomorrow? I love you.\" \"You're right, I love you too Catherine.\" Back in California, Jackie looked down at the half empty bottle of wine after and decided to finish it. She needed a good nights rest and wasn't sure she could without it. The next morning as Catherine was eating breakfast and working on her resume, she heard the door bell ring. When she opened it there was a delivery man holding a bouquet of flowers. \"Catherine Stark?\" He asked. \"That's me.\" Sign here please. Catherine smelled the flowers as she headed to the kitchen. She set the vase down on the counter and removed the card. She laughed when she saw the name Ethan x'ed out and Catherine written over it. She opened it up and read, Someone once told me, \"Don't forget to breathe\" Love, J. Catherine smiled. She missed Jackie so much. She always had a way of calming her down, especially with her humor. It was still early in California so she just sent her a text. \"I don't want to wake you up, but just wanted to say I love you so much. Thanks for the flowers, hurry up and get here! xoxo\" Catherine spent the rest of the day working hard on her resume and looking up job postings at universities. When Jackie woke up and saw Catherine's text, she gave her a call. \"Hey Porcupine.\" \"So you liked them?\" \"Yes, especially the card, you goof. Thanks so much, I really needed that.\" \"I know you did, I wish I could do more. What are you up to today?\" \"Working hard on my resume, you?\" \"I need to pack for Canada and run a few errands before my flight tonight.\" \"Oh, you leave tonight?\" \"Yeah, we're going to get there a couple of days early to do some press and sight see. First we're going to Vancouver then Montreal.\" \"Oh wow, don't wear yourself out too much before you get here,\" she teased. \"That won't happen. But hey, I'm going to let you get back to work, I'll talk to you later before my flight okay?\" Jackie felt relieved after their phone call. Catherine seemed to be back to herself, all she needed to do was get through these next few days in Canada until she could see her again. Catherine spent all day and night perfecting her resume and gathering her referral letters. Professor Hecht had written her a nice one before she had left the university, perhaps feeling a little guilty. She decided to quit for the night and poured herself a glass of wine before retreating to the couch to watch T.V. with Ethan. She must have fallen asleep because she woke up to her phone ringing. It was Jackie. \"Hey Jackie\" she rubbed her eyes and looked at the clock, it was past midnight. \"I'm sorry, did I wake you? I keep forgetting about the time difference.\" \"It's okay, are you at the airport?\" \"We're on our way. How was your day?\" \"Good, I got a lot accomplished. Did you schedule a flight for Bloomington yet?\" \"Not yet, I'm going to when I get to the airport since I need to change my return flight. I should be there Monday hopefully, I'll let you know.\" \"I can't wait, neither can Ethan,\" Catherine said as she looked down at him on her lap. \"Me either, it's been too long. Hey, we're about to pull up so I'll talk to you tomorrow. Sleep tight, I love you!\" \"Be safe! I love you too.\" When Jackie got to the gate, Tommy was already there. She hadn't spoken to him since the night he came over when she was drunk, so she was feeling sort of embarrassed. \"Hey Jacks, how's the head?\" He joked. \"Yeah, about that... I'm really sorry. Can we just forget about all of that?\" \"You think I'd let you off that easy?\" Jackie cocked her head at him. \"I'm kidding, yes I'll try not to make too much fun. So are you in a better mood?\" \"Much better.\" \"Because you know,\" Tommy leaned into her, \"I can help you get over whoever made you that way.\" \"Sorry Tommy, that train has left the station. No more of that.\" \"Like I haven't heard that before\" he smiled. Jackie just rolled her eyes at him. She hadn't discussed how to handle Tommy with Catherine since they had gotten back together, but wasn't sure how to bring it up. First Catherine wanted her to make things public, now she wanted to keep things private so Jackie wasn't sure what to do. Her fake romance with Tommy was really making the press go wild at the Neptune premieres, and she figured Catherine would understand that it was all just for work. Thankfully their seats weren't together on the plane, the last thing she wanted to do was talk to Tommy for two hours. When they landed in Vancouver their team of assistants and body guards met them at the gate. There were paparazzi and fans everywhere, Jackie was in total shock. Tommy came up next to her, \"isn't this awesome?!\" People were shouting their names, asking so many questions Jackie couldn't think straight, she just kept smiling and waving. As soon as they got in the limo she collapsed into the seat. \"Holy crap.\" Tommy was still on a high, looking out all of the windows, jumping from seat to seat. \"Wasn't what you were expecting was it?\" Asked her assistant, Rachel. \"Not at all, it can get crazy in LA, but nothing like this.\" \"Well it's just going to get bigger once people see the movie.\" They pulled up to the hotel and Jackie settled into her room. Her mind was in a whirlwind, she couldn't believe how crazy it was here considering how late it was. She had no idea it would come to this and thought about what Rachel said, how this was just the beginning. Jackie was woken up at 4:30 a.m. to get ready for hair and make up. Rachel went over the day's schedule as she chugged her coffee while the team worked on her hair and face. She texted Catherine \"Are you awake?\" Catherine was laying in bed when she heard her phone. She smiled when she saw it was from Jackie. She looked at the time and couldn't believe she was awake, considering the time difference. \"Sure am, I can't believe you are, isn't it like 5 a.m. there?\" Jackie was happy to see Catherine awake. She snapped a picture of her and sent it. Catherine laughed when she saw the picture. Jackie's hair was clipped all over the place and she had a sad face, holding her coffee. \"Poor baby. Send me an after pic ;)\" \"Only if you send me a pic.\" \"I look terrible, later.\" \"No, right now, in bed. Nothing I haven't seen ;)\" This was foreign to Catherine. She didn't have a smart phone and wasn't technologically savvy when it came to things like this. \"You're forgetting the phone I have. And I'm too old for this ;)\" \"Give me a break, you're 33. You're going to have to learn. I'll teach you next week.\" \"Okay, deal. Only if I get that after pic though.\" Rachel noticed the giant smile on Jackie's face as she was texting. \"Who has you all chipper this morning?\" \"No one.\" She smiled guilty. \"Sure.\" Rachel replied. \"I'll get it out of you eventually.\" Catherine didn't hear from Jackie for a little while so went ahead and got a shower. When she came back out, Jackie had sent an after picture of herself all done up. Catherine sat on the bed and just stared at it for a while. Jackie was usually a more casual person, so anytime she saw her made up like this it would blow her away. \"You're gorgeous, and now I miss you even more.\" Jackie was in the elevator when she saw Catherine's text. As soon as she hit the lobby there was a mob of fans outside. She quickly put her phone away and Rachel took her hand. \"You got this.\" \"Can we talk to them?\" Tommy asked. Rachel looked down at her watch, \"ten minutes guys then we have to head out.\" Tommy and Jackie talked to as many of their fans as possible, posing for pictures and signing autographs until their body guards guided them into their car. Jackie took out her phone and video recorded them all going crazy against the car and sent it to Catherine. \"This is crazy!\" Catherine watched the video and was shocked. She couldn't believe this was Jackie's life now. \"I won't be able to talk much today :( hopefully I'll get done in time to call you tonight.\" \"Call whenever you're done, I don't care how late it is.\" \"You sure? Will do. But I gotta go, have a good day. Xoxo\" \"You too, xoxo.\" Catherine really missed Jackie now, she couldn't wait for her to get here. After seeing Jackie's career booming, it motivated her to want to work harder to get her name out there. At least this would keep her busy while Jackie was preoccupied in Canada. By the end of the day she had sent her resume to six different universities. She tried staying up for Jackie's phone call, but felt her tired eyes failing her. She turned the ringer on her phone all the way up to hear the call and went to sleep. Jackie was so exhausted that she had to drink 6 coffees throughout the day just to stay awake. They didn't get back to the hotel until after 1 a.m. so all she had energy for was a shower before collapsing on her bed and passing out, forgetting to call Catherine.[Chapter 14] When Catherine awoke, she eagerly leaned over and checked her phone. She felt guilty thinking she must had slept through Jackie's call. But when she checked, there weren't any missed, not even a text message. She must have been really busy Catherine thought. Trying not to let it bother her, she got ready and took Ethan on a long run. Jackie's alarm went off at 4:30 again. She was exhausted and had a headache, probably the result of a caffeine withdrawal from having so many coffees yesterday. Rachel was knocking on her door not even a minute later. Jackie stumbled to the door and slightly cracked it open, but Rachel came bursting in, letting in the hallway light. \"Whoa what's wrong with you?\" She asked turning on all of the lights. Jackie squinted at the sudden shock to her eyes, \"You mean other than the 4 hours of sleep I got last night? Well I also have a pounding headache to add to the mix.\" \"I'll get you some aspirin. Now hurry up and shower, your glam squad will be here soon\" she said sarcastically. As Jackie showered she remembered forgetting to call Catherine. Shit! She hurried up and went to grab her phone but Rachel came back with the aspirin and a water. \"Here take these, now lay down for a second and let me get a wash cloth to put over your eyes, they're puffy as hell.\" Jackie did as she said, the cool towel felt glorious on her pounding head. She almost fell back asleep until she heard hair and make up come trampling in. \"Up and at em! No time to spare, you have a radio shows to get to!\" Jackie got up, cursing, and plopped down in the chair. Rachel went over her schedule for the day as usual, then brought Tommy and the publicists in to go over what questions the radio hosts will be asking them. \"They want to ask if you two are a couple.\" \"No, we aren't answering that,\" Jackie said bluntly. \"Come on Jacks, let's give 'em a little mystery at least. How about no comment or we're just having a good time together promoting the movie?\" Tommy suggested. \"I like those last two. I agree with Tommy, keep them wondering and keep you two in the headlines\" said the publicist. \"Fine, but that's it.\" They went over the other questions until it was time for Jackie to get dressed. \"Alright, get out and go get ready\" Rachel said as she shooed Tommy out. Once they were ready they all went down to the car, this time not stopping for the fans. \"Sorry guys, they're in a hurry! Tune into the radio today!\" As soon as Jackie sat down she asked Rachel for her phone. It was almost 11 a.m. in Bloomington and she felt awful, hopefully Catherine wasn't upset. She didn't want everyone hearing so she had to resort to texting her, which she hated. \"Good morning Gorgeous! I'm sooo sorry! We got in really late last night and I passed out, then had another 4:30 wake up call and didn't have a chance to call you this morning :( please forgive me.\" Catherine was cleaning her kitchen when she heard her phone, and was relieved that it was Jackie finally. \"It's okay, I fell asleep early. Sounds like they're keeping you busy.\" \"It's torture. I hardly got 4 hours of sleep last night. We have radio interviews all morning and the big premiere and after party tonight, then catch a flight to Montreal tomorrow morning. I'm so tired and my head is pounding :(\" \"I'm sorry, try to stay sane. Only a few more days then I won't even make you get out of bed ;)\" \"That sounds absolutely perfect. My plane lands in Bloomington at 6 a.m on Monday. It can't come soon enough. Sorry to do this but I have to go again, have a great day xoxo.\" \"Love you, feel better.\" Catherine wished not being Jackie's top priority didn't bother her, but being a strong woman who liked to be in control, it did. She hated being the inferior one in a relationship, hence why she dated students. She needed her career back more than ever. The radio shows ran smoothly even though it pained Jackie to, in not so many words, admit to being in a relationship with Tommy. They wrapped up around noon, giving them a couple hours to relax before having to get ready for the premiere. As as soon as she changed out of her clothes Jackie called Catherine. \"Hey there movie star\" Catherine answered. \"Stop,\" she laughed, \"I've finally got two hours to myself. How are you?\" \"I'm good, are you feeling better?\" \"I am now that I can talk to you. I'm sorry I've been so busy.\" \"It's okay Jackie, you don't need to keep apologizing. I know your schedule is crazy.\" Jackie was silent on the other end. \"Are you okay Porcupine?\" Silence. \"Jackie?\" It was still silent. Jackie must have fallen asleep. She didn't want to wake her, but wanted to make sure she really was asleep so waited a few moments longer before hanging up. Jackie woke up to Rachel knocking on her door. She was disoriented, then saw the phone in her hand and remembered she was talking to Catherine. \"Damn't,\" she said to herself, before opening the door. \"Have a nice nap?\" \"Apparently, I don't remember falling asleep though.\" \"Alright well let's get some food in you before the squad arrives. A caterer has set up some food for you all down the hall, so meet me down there when you're ready.\" Rachel looked her up and down confused, \"I thought you were home schooled?\" \"I was, why?\" \"Then where did you get a high school lacrosse shirt?\" Jackie looked down not realizing she was wearing Catherine's shirt. \"Oh, it's a friend of mines. I stole it from her. I'll meet you down there in a bit.\" After Rachel left, Jackie looked down at her shirt and smiled. She texted Catherine back then headed down to get lunch. Catherine saw Jackie's text, \"I need to just put a permanent I'm sorry at the beginning of every text :( sorry I fell asleep. Just realized I'm wearing your lacrosse shirt, it's the closest I can get to sleeping next to you. Talk to you soon love.\" Catherine responded \"I'm never getting that shirt back, am I? ;) \" The next couple hours were a whirlwind, before Jackie knew it she was squeezing into her dress and getting her final touches. When she was in the bathroom she snapped a picture to send to Catherine before heading down to the limo. It had been a few hours since Catherine heard from Jackie when she received her picture. It was Jackie in her dress for the premiere, she flashed another frown. \"Wish you were my date :( \" \"Me too Porcupine, have fun tonight. Not too much wine, I'm not there to mend your head ;)\" The limo was full of Tommy and Jackie's assistants and publicists. \"Okay guys, we need you to walk the carpet together, be flirtatious, whatever, just get the crowd going okay?\" They both agreed. Pulling up to the red carpet, they were both amazed at the crowd. This all felt so surreal to Jackie and she wished more than anything that Catherine was here to share it with her. As soon as they stepped out of the limo Tommy offered his arm out to Jackie and whispered in her ear, \"You're absolutely stunning tonight Miss Kirk.\" Jackie smiled and thanked him, \"You clean up nicely as well.\" As they made their way down the line of interviewers, Jackie answered the same questions over and over again; what she was working on now, what it was like to come back to Neptune, and what was her relationship with Tommy. \"We had a great time filming and are having such a fun time getting to travel the world together. He's a great guy.\" Just then Tommy joined her and put his arm around her waist. As soon as he did, the crowd went wild. Jackie couldn't help but smile, this was an actors dream and she just needed to start enjoying it while it lasted, Catherine would understand. The rest of the carpet she began flirting with Tommy more and had her picture taken so many times her eyes were seeing spots. She took her time with her fans, making sure to connect with as many of them as she could. It felt so good meeting people who loved her work. After the premiere, they headed to the after party. Jackie was going to take Catherine's advice and not drink much, but everyone was having so much fun that she wanted to as well. After all, she was young, traveling the world, and living her dream. Why not enjoy it to its fullest, because God knows it could all end in an instant. Her and her cast mates danced and partied until 4 a.m. Jackie woke up at 6:30 running to the bathroom to throw up, not knowing how they even got home. She couldn't believe how drunk she had gotten and couldn't remember the last time she had blacked out. After literally emptying her entire stomach, she stumbled back into her room to find the bottle of aspirin. Before she got to her suitcase she froze in her tracks. She couldn't believe what she was seeing, Tommy was in her bed fast asleep.[Chapter 15] Jackie was paralyzed until the panic finally set in. \"Tommy wake up!\" Jackie yelled, shaking him as hard as she could. \"Wake up!\" \"Ow, what! Stop! I'm awake!\" He yelled. \"What the hell happened last night!? Why are in my room!? Why are you in my bed?!\" \"Ugh my head! Stop shouting!\" He groaned as he rubbed his temples. \"Tommy, answer my fucking question!\" \"We were wasted, why are you so angry?\" \"Did we...\" She looked down at him and raised her eyebrows, insinuating what she feared. \"No, I tried but you smacked me.\" He reached up and touched his cheek, \"Hard, I might add. You were so wasted that you kept telling me you had a girlfriend instead of boyfriend.\" He laughed. \"And since when do you have a boyfriend?\" Jackie let out a sigh of relief, \"Thank God! Now get out before someone sees you. They'll be at our doors soon to wake us up.\" Tommy stood up and was wearing just his boxer briefs. \"Why are you in your boxers?!\" \"I was wearing skinny jeans! I can't sleep in those!\" She found his pants on the floor and threw them at him as he made his way to the door. \"What are you doing!?\" \"Leaving like you asked!\" \"You are not stumbling out of my hotel room at 6:30 in the morning not wearing any pants!\" When Tommy finally squeezed back into his jeans, Jackie pushed him out the door then grabbed her phone and sat on her bed. She was scared to check her phone, hoping she didn't drunkenly call or text Catherine. After getting up enough courage, she slid her phone on and checked her messages and call log, none to Catherine. What a relief. Even though she didn't do anything, Jackie couldn't shake the guilt. She knew she should call Catherine since they hadn't talked since yesterday afternoon, but didn't know what to say. She decided to take a bath instead, to help clear her head and help her hangover. As she was getting out, she heard Rachel banging on her door, \"Be ready to go in 45 minutes.\" Jackie's phone went off, her heart beat fast, thinking it was Catherine. It wasn't, it was a text from Matt. \"Saw pics from last night on TMZ, glad you took my advice about Tommy. Looks like you two had a good time. Way to sell it ;)\" Jackie's body went numb. She nervously went on TMZ's website and saw the pictures of the red carpet and after party. It showed her and Tommy dancing on each other, then leaving in the same limo holding hands. She didn't think Catherine would see them considering she didn't even own a smart phone, but knew she better say something before she found out. After getting dressed and packed, she paced the room until she got up the nerve to call her. The phone kept ringing, \"she must have saw\" Jackie thought, but before she had time to freak out even more, Catherine answered. She wasn't sure what to say when she picked up. \"Jackie? Are you there?\" \"Yes. Sorry. H-how are you?\" Jackie said stuttering her words. \"I'm okay, how was the premiere?\" \"Really good, but I'm paying for it today.\" \"Party too hard?\" That's an understatement, she thought. \"Yes. Catherine...\" \"Yeah?\" Jackie was terrified to tell her about last night, instead she chickened out and just said, \"I miss you so much.\" \"I miss you too Porcupine, you're half way done though. When do you leave for Montreal?\" \"We're leaving for the airport in a few minutes. I can't wait to have some down time there. All we have is press and radio, no premieres or parties.\" \"Good, no offense but you've sounded pretty terrible lately. You could use the rest,\" she teased. \"All I can say is thank God for the glam squad, or I'd look it too.\" \"Not possible.\" Catherine being so sweet to her, was killing her inside. Just then Rachel knocked on the door, \"Jackie, are you ready?\" \"One sec!\" She called out. This was the first phone call she didn't mind being interrupted. \"Hey Catherine, I'm really sorry but-\" \"You've got to go. I know the routine by now,\" Catherine joked. They said goodbye and Jackie made her way down to the lobby. She spotted Tommy and pulled him aside before they got into the car. \"Tommy not a word about last night, you hear me?\" \"Yeah, okay. But I promise nothing happened.\" \"I don't care, not a word to anyone.\" She said sternly. Tommy was so caught up in his instant fame that Jackie feared he'd do anything to get attention. \"I got it Jacks, relax.\" Jackie spent the next two days in Montreal doing press, a little sight seeing, but most of all- staying sober and out of trouble. Sunday night finally came around, they didn't get back to the hotel until close to midnight. Jackie had to be at the airport in a few hours so tried to get some sleep but kept worrying about Catherine. She was going to tell her about her night with Tommy and hoped she wouldn't be too upset, she didn't want the few days they had together to be ruined. She landed in Indianapolis at 6 and was on Catherine's door step at 7:30 a.m. She looked up at the house, not believing she was really back here, then knocked excitedly on the door until Catherine finally opened it, Ethan was at her feet. \"Ethan!\" She knelt down, baby talking to him and petting him as he licked her face. \"Jeez, you don't see me for a week and you make over the dog more than me?\" Catherine teased. Jackie stood up and smiled. \"Come here\" she said, pulling Catherine into her and kissing her. The two made out like a couple of a high schoolers before finally pulling away. \"Better?\" \"Much\" Catherine smiled. \"Follow me,\" she took Jackie's hand and flashed her a mischievous smile, the one that always hinted she had something up her sleeve. When they entered the kitchen, there was an entire spread of breakfast food lining the table. \"Oh. My. God. You are the greatest person on earth.\" Jackie was not a good cook at all and it was rare for her to eat a home cooked meal. When she wasn't eating catered food or fancy dinners on the road, she was living off of Chinese food and pizza at home. Catherine sat her down and kissed her on the cheek. \"I figured it's been a while since you've had a home cooked meal.\" \"You have no idea,\" Jackie said, stuffing her face. Catherine always took care of her, it was one of the many things that made her fall in love with her. After they were done eating, Jackie grabbed her suitcase before they headed upstairs. She dove on the bed head first, sprawling out. \"God, I missed this place.\" Catherine laid down next to her, \"it's missed you too.\" Jackie turned her head over to look at Catherine. She was so beautiful, Jackie wondered every day how she got so lucky. \"You know, this house always felt more like a home to me than my parents' house.\" Catherine's eyebrows scrunched together as she smiled sweetly and kissed Jackie's hand. It never felt like Jackie was a guest when she was here, it always felt like she belonged there. \"Well it sure has felt empty without you.\" Jackie smiled back, Catherine couldn't help but notice how fatigued her eyes looked. She tucked her hair behind her ear before saying, \"you look exhausted.\" \"Gee, thanks,\" Jackie laughed. \"I think I look pretty good for only getting 2-4 hours of sleep a night, for the last four nights.\" \"Why don't you take a nap?\" \"I don't want to waste the little time we have.\" A nap sounded marvelous but she didn't want to waste one second with Catherine. \"We're together aren't we? You're exhausted, you need to rest. It's still really early anyways.\" \"Will you stay with me? And please don't let me sleep all day.\" \"Of course I will, and I won't. But I need you well rested\" she gave Jackie another one of her mischievous smiles. Jackie got up and moved towards Catherine, snuggling into her. \"This is exactly what I have been looking forward to all week.\" She meant every word of it too. After the fiasco with Tommy, all she wanted was to be back in Catherine's arms and know that everything was alright. Having Jackie back in her bed, cuddled up next to her, made Catherine's heart almost burst with happiness. She couldn't believe that less than two weeks ago Jackie wasn't even in her life anymore, now here she was and everything was perfect. It wasn't long after Jackie fell asleep that Catherine did as well. She had woken very early to make breakfast, so didn't mind the idea of a nap. A couple hours later Catherine woke up finding Jackie still sound asleep with her arms wrapped around her. She was shocked, considering Jackie usually liked her space to curl up into a ball when she slept. Catherine examined her closely, how adorable she looked when she slept, her little Porcupine. She noticed the dark circles under her eyes, the poor girl was exhausted. Not wanting to wake her, Catherine laid in her arms soaking up the moment a little longer, thinking about their relationship. It was crazy how fast things had changed between them. The ending of their relationship was almost as fast as it had began, they never really communicated in either event. They hardly spoke before they slept together then before they knew it, Jackie was spending almost every night at Catherine's and they were falling in love. The end was something she tried not to think about, but could never get it out of her head. She was shocked Jackie even wanted anything to do with her after the way she had treated her. But here she was, back in her arms and in her bed, where it all began. When she finally decided to get up, she gently removed Jackie's arms and slipped out of bed. Jackie hardly even stirred. Once downstairs, Catherine checked her phone and saw a voicemail. Trying not to get her hopes up she took a deep breath before listening. It was UC Berkley saying they saw her speech at Stanford and received her application. They wanted to set up an interview. Catherine couldn't stop smiling, this day couldn't get any better. She immediately called them back and set up an interview for the following week. \"Thank you so much for this opportunity and I'll see you next week!\" After hanging up she grabbed her laptop to look at flights. She knew Jackie would want her to stop in LA, so decided to wait for her to make any final arrangements. Although Berkley was in California, it was rather far from LA. It wasn't her first choice but it was one of the top ten psychology departments in the country, so she couldn't help but be excited. She tip toed upstairs to check on Jackie who was still dead to the world, so decided to start dinner. She planned a big feast for Jackie's first night, all of her favorites, and figured by the time she was done Jackie would be awake. Jackie woke up disheveled and looked around. She smiled as soon as she remembered that she was at Catherine's. Looking at the clock she suddenly felt panicked that she had slept the day away, it was after 5 p.m. She smelled something delicious in the air, Catherine must be cooking dinner. Jackie walked over to her suitcase and retrieved a box from her carry on, a gift she had gotten Catherine in Canada. Entering the kitchen she saw Catherine leaning over the stove and snuck up behind her. She wrapped her arms around her waist and kissed her neck. Catherine jumped, \"Oh my God, you scared the shit out of me!\" Jackie laughed as Catherine turned around in her arms, wrapping her own around Jackie's neck. Jackie leaned in and kissed her, then began kissing down her neck. It was sending chills down Catherine's body. She pushed Jackie over to the island and picked her up, setting her down on it. They both paused, looking each other in the eyes, then smiled. The attraction between them had always been so natural and exciting. As things started to heat up between them, a pot on the stove started boiling over. \"Catherine, your dinner!\" \"To be continued\" Catherine said, then kissed Jackie on the forehead. \"Hey, I have a bone to pick with you\" Jackie said sternly, popping a grape into her mouth. \"Yeah? What's that.\" Catherine asked as she stirred the pot of pasta. \"I told you not to let me sleep all day.\" \"But how do you feel?\" \"Great, actually.\" \"Then there you have it. I feel great too. Guess what happened while you were sleeping?\" \"You saved a man from a train and pretended to be his fiance?\" Catherine looked back confused. \"Sandra Bullock? Movie humor, never mind. Go on.\" \"I have an interview next week\" Catherine smiled out of the corner of her mouth. \"What?! Where!\" Jackie jumped down from the island. \"UC Berkley.\" \"Holy crap! That's awesome!\" Jackie wrapped her arms around her. \"When's your interview?\" \"Next Tuesday. I need to schedule flights but wanted to check with you first. Maybe I can visit before or after?\" \"You better! Let me check my calendar.\" Jackie grabbed her phone out of her pocket and skimmed through her calendar. \"I'll be in New York this weekend, then will be in town the rest of the week.\" \"Great! Can you check flights while I finish up dinner? You're better at that than me.\" \"And you're better at cooking than me,\" Jackie laughed. \"This is true,\" Catherine teased. Jackie was ecstatic booking Catherine's flights, she couldn't believe she may end up in California with her. As she was wrapping up, Catherine began moving the food to the table. Jackie slowly closed the laptop as she noticed what all Catherine had prepared. She looked up at Catherine who flashed her a wink. \"Like it?\" \"All of my favorites? Are you trying to make me fat?\" She joked, getting up from her chair and moving towards Catherine. \"Yes, especially since you embarrassed me during our jog. Rematch next time I visit\" She said, wrapping her arms around Jackie's neck. \"You're on,\" Jackie replied as she held her close. All of a sudden the guilt began to creep back in, \"You're so good to me, I don't deserve it.\" \"Why would you say that? You've been working until the point of exhaustion. You deserve to relax and be spoiled for a couple of days.\" \"Because you've had to deal with me hardly talking to you, and didn't once complain.\" Among other things, like Jackie getting drunk and completely dismissing Catherine's feelings, all for the sake of her selfish gains of being adored by the media. \"Don't beat yourself up, I knew you were busy. Come on let's eat before it gets cold.\" After dinner, they poured some wine and went to sit in the living room. \"Oh! I almost forgot!\" Jackie ran back into the kitchen and came back with the box. \"You distracted me earlier.\" She smiled. \"For you Miss Stark.\" She laid out her hands, presenting her with the gift. Catherine looked at her, the corner of her mouth curving up suspiciously. \"What's this?\" \"Just a couple of things. Open the bigger one first.\" Catherine slowly unwrapped it, it was an iPhone. \"Now you don't have an excuse not to send me pictures,\" Jackie grinned. \"Jackie this is too much, I can't accept this.\" \"Are you kidding me? You just cooked me two giant meals, and this is more for me anyway,\" she winked. \"Okay now the next one.\" Catherine carefully opened the tiny box and couldn't believe her eyes. It was a diamond necklace. \"Jackie, It's gorgeous, I can't-\" \"Stop it.\" Jackie stood up and fastened it behind Catherine's neck. \"Now you have something to remind you of me when we're apart.\" Catherine grabbed hold of it and looked down, completely mesmerized by it. She had never received something so beautiful or meaningful before. \"I love you.\" \"I know, I am pretty great\" Jackie joked. Catherine went to put the boxes down on the coffee table but felt some weight still in it. She stuck her hand in and pulled out a big bone with a bow on it. \"That's for my Ethan,\" Jackie took it from her and got on the floor with him, \"Here you go buddy!\" Catherine watched Jackie and Ethan playing on the floor in awe. Not only did she buy her two of the most thoughtful gifts, but she even brought a bone home for her dog. Catherine couldn't bear the thought of living without her again. \"Come back here.\" Jackie came back next to her and Catherine put her arms around her, holding her close for a long time. All of a sudden she started to get choked up. Embarrassed, she tried to play it off, but Jackie felt her trembling. She slowly pulled her away. \"Catherine, what's wrong?\" \"Nothing, I'm just really happy. This day has just been so perfect. With you, the job, now this.\" \"Then why are you crying?\" Jackie asked as she wiped her tears away. \"It's been a really hard year and I guess I'm just overwhelmed, this is embarrassing.\" \"Don't be embarrassed, I love seeing tough Stark's softer side. I'm not done yet though.\" \"You're not?\" \"Nope. Stay here, I have something else upstairs.\" It felt good making Catherine so happy and Jackie had much more up her sleeve, it was Catherine's time to be spoiled. Jackie disappeared upstairs and came back down 15 minutes later with a giant smile on her face. \"Okay, come on.\" She took Catherine's hand and led her upstairs. When they reached the bedroom door she had Catherine go first, \"go on.\" Catherine slowly opened the door and walked inside. Her entire bedroom was lit up with candles. Her mouth dropped as she looked around, it was one of those moments that didn't seem real. It was too good to be true. Jackie silently came in behind her and shut the door. Catherine felt her arms wrap around her waist, \"Do you like it?\" She held on to her arms tight, \"I'm speechless.\" \"I have more, but you can't make fun of me okay?\" \"Of course I won't.\" \"Promise?\" \"Yes, I promise.\" \"This is the cheesiest thing I've ever done in my entire life, just know that.\" She laughed then turned on a playlist from her phone. \"I have a lot of free time on planes, so made a playlist that reminded me of you.\" Catherine stuck her bottom lip out and made a sad face. \"Jackie that's not embarrassing, it's adorable.\" Jackie laughed, \"okay, last thing.\" She took Catherine's hand and led her to the bathroom where there were more candles and a bubble bath drawn. On the edge of the tub were two white fluffy robes and a bottle of wine. \"Seriously? Is there anything you didn't do?\" \"I know, it's too much isn't it?\" Jackie said, embarrassed. \"No, not at all. It's perfect.\" Catherine pulled her in and kissed her, \"I love it.\" Jackie smiled and began removing Catherine's clothes. She kissed her shoulder then made her way down her body, stopping to kiss each part before removing her pants. Catherine's body was on fire as she tried to control herself. They both slipped into the tub and Jackie grabbed the bottle of wine. \"Wine and bathtubs? This could get dangerous,\" Catherine teased. \"I'm never going to live that down am I?\" \"Never.\" She smirked. \"You better watch your back Stark. First embarrassing thing you do, it's over.\" \"Do you remember the last time you were in this tub?\" Catherine asked, as she began to indulge in the reminiscence. \"You passive aggressively mending my face, and telling me not to jerk off to myself on your couch?\" Catherine clamped her teeth together and smiled awkwardly, \"okay, do you remember the first time you were in this tub?\" She laughed. \"Yes. I asked you if I was different from the others and you blew me off.\" \"You caught on to that?\" \"Of course I did. I was looking for some reassurance in our relationship and you made me wonder even more.\" \"Well the answer is yes now.\" \"Better late than never,\" she laughed. Catherine became quiet, thinking about the conversation they had that day. \"Hey Jackie?\" \"Yes?\" \"When did you fall in love with me?\" she asked, sheepishly. \"When you picked me up from my Uncle's house on Thanksgiving.\" Jackie didn't even need a moment to think about it. \"Really?\" \"Yeah. I was so upset and you were the only person I wanted to call. Then the way you took care of me, I fell hard for you that day. Other than Mark, no one has ever cared for me that way.\" Catherine realized that Jackie hadn't even mentioned her mother once since they've reunited.\"How are things with your mom?\" \"Let's not kill the mood with that topic. What about you?\" \"When did I know?\" Jackie nodded. \"My birthday. I told you, but you were sleeping.\" Catherine smiled, remembering that day perfectly, much like she would remember this one. \"Wow, I wish I would've known.\" \"You didn't think I did?\" \"No, after our fight I was completely crushed. Why do you think I left so suddenly that last day here? If I would've stayed any longer, I knew I would've been hurt all over again.\" Catherine felt terrible. She had always assumed Jackie had known, but now her taking the audition and abruptly leaving that night all made sense. \"I'm so sorry.\" \"The past is in the past. Let's just enjoy the present,\" Jackie said as she put down her wine and moved to the other side of the tub, towards Catherine. She put her arms on either side of the tub and slid in between Catherine's legs. She started kissing her, but when she moved to her neck she could feel Catherine trying to take control. Jackie pushed her back down, \"Stop. Let someone else take care of you for once.\" The acoustics in the bathroom made Catherine's moans louder than usual, good thing her neighbors were a decent distance away. By the time they were finished the water had started to become cold. Jackie got out of the bath and put on a robe before holding the other open for Catherine. She grabbed the wine and put it on the night stand. When she turned around Catherine placed her arms over Jackie's shoulders and kissed her. \"Now your turn,\" she said as she started untying Jackie's robe. \"Not so fast,\" Jackie said as she started retying it. \"Tonight is all about you.\" They were up until the middle of the night, Jackie's nap obviously paid off. In between rounds they just laid in bed surrounded by the candles, listening to Jackie's playlist on repeat. Jackie finally let Catherine have her way once she made sure she was completely satisfied, but of course once Catherine finished, Jackie fell asleep. Catherine laid in bed with Jackie sleeping next to her, closely listening to the songs for a little longer before blowing out the candles and going to sleep. No one had taken care of her the way Jackie had tonight. Her walls were completely crumbled and for the first time in her life, she wasn't scared of how vulnerable it made her. She knew Jackie would never hurt her.[Chapter 16] The sun shining through the shutters in her bedroom was brighter than usual. Catherine rolled over and looked at the clock. It was 10:30. No wonder it was so bright, she couldn't remember the last time she had slept in this late. She looked over at Jackie who was still sound asleep. This wasn't surprising considering the lack of sleep she had gotten all weekend. Catherine slipped out of bed and began getting ready for the day. When she returned to the bedroom, Jackie was slowly opening her eyes. \"Please tell me I didn't sleep all day again.\" \"No. It's only 11:15. I actually just got up 45 minutes ago, I guess you wore me out.\" Jackie grinned, \"mission accomplished.\" Catherine smiled at her then made her way across the bedroom, and sat next to her. She leaned in for a kiss when Jackie's phone began to ring. \"Hold that thought. It's Matt, I need to take this.\" \"Hey Matt! ... What? ... Which one?\" Jackie suddenly moved to the other side of the bed and turned her back towards Catherine. \"Why would I be happy about that? ... You know why ... Okay Matt, talk to you later.\" Catherine was curious as to why Jackie seemed so upset. She kept her back towards her, completely silent, when she hung up. Instead of telling her what was going on, she was looking down at her phone intently. \"What was that all about?\" Catherine asked. \"I made my first tabloid magazine.\" Jackie didn't seem thrilled. \"What's wrong with that?\" \"They aren't exactly the most flattering pictures.\" \"Let me see, they can't be that bad,\" Catherine said as she moved to Jackie's side of the bed and stole the phone from her hands. \"Catherine, wait!\" Jackie shouted as she whipped around, trying to stop her. Catherine could feel the smile on her face slowly disappear as she stared at the pictures. She was well aware of Tommy and Jackie's fake relationship, but had no idea it was this physical. \"I was drunk. Too drunk. The publicists were pushing us to flirt and the crowd was loving it, so I just got caught up in it all.\" Catherine stayed silent as she began reading the article. These pictures were from the Vancouver premiere, after they had gotten back together. \"Catherine say something, anything.\" \"I guess I just didn't know this was still going on.\" \"I know. I should have discussed it with you. But our publicists were there and kept pressuring us, and I didn't know what to say since we're not public. I'm so sorry, please know it means absolutely nothing.\" Catherine paused before saying what was on her mind. \"Is this as far as it went?\" Jackie was silent. Catherine looked up from the phone for the first time and Jackie wouldn't make eye contact. Catherine's skin began radiating, matching the burning she was feeling inside of her chest and behind her eyes. Something happened. \"Not exactly. I woke up the next morning and he was in my bed. We didn't do anything though. He told me he came onto me, but I slapped him across the face and told him I had a girlfriend. He figured I was drunk and meant boyfriend.\" \"What do you mean he told you?\" \"I blacked out that night, I don't even remember getting back to my room.\" \"So it's possible that something could have happened?\" Catherine wasn't convinced. If nothing happened, why did they sleep in the same bed when Tommy had his own room. \"I would remember something like that. And you know I would never do that to you.\" Jackie lifted herself onto her knees and moved over to Catherine, taking her hand. \"Please don't be upset. I have been feeling absolutely awful about this. Not because I did anything, but because I remember the feeling I felt when I saw you with that man here, and I don't want you to ever feel like that. I love you so much and just wanted these couple of days here to be perfect.\" Catherine stayed silent, carefully absorbing Jackie's words. She began thinking about everything that happened between them last night and started to question the sincerity of Jackie's actions. \"So was last night all just to help relieve your guilt? The phone, the jewelry, everything that happened in this room? You know you went above and beyond last night, you said so yourself. I went to bed feeling the happiest I ever have in my entire life, thinking how safe I felt with you. Now it just feels like it was all just a show to mend your guilty conscience.\" Jackie just stared at her, the expression on her face started to change as she let go of Catherine's hand. \"That's what you think of me? You think I'm manipulative? I completely exposed myself to you last night, and you accuse it all of just being a guise?\" Jackie got up from the bed, \"I assure you Catherine, you just hurt me much deeper than these pictures hurt you. The imperative difference being I was putting on a show in these pictures, not last night\" she said before storming out of the bedroom. Catherine sat on the bed thinking about everything that had just happened. How come every time they had a really good night, it was all shot to hell the next day? Was all of this really worth letting Jackie storm out of her room, and out of her life yet again? They promised each other this time would be different but so far it hadn't been. As she made her way downstairs to go apologize, she almost ran over Jackie who was sitting at the top of the steps. \"This is as far as I got this time,\" Jackie said with her arms crossed around her knees. Catherine smiled and sat down next to her. \"And this the first time I've chased after you when you've left. Seems like we're both making progress.\" Jackie offered a slight laugh but kept staring down the steps. \"I'm sorry. I know you're under a lot of pressure to keep this thing up with Tommy, it just makes my skin crawl knowing he's all over you.\" \"It's not that, it's what you said about last night. It was one of the best nights we've ever had and it hurts me to think it's all tarnished now.\" \"It wont be. I'll never forget that night, I promise. I was just hurting and being overly dramatic.\" Catherine swooped Jackie's hair out of her face to show her sincerity. Jackie finally turned to face her, \"I don't want to fight anymore.\" \"Me either. But can you maybe not get black out drunk around Tommy anymore?\" \"That is a deal I will gladly accept.\" Jackie laid her head on her shoulder as Catherine wrapped her arm around her. \"Come to New York with me.\" Jackie said softly. \"What?\" Jackie got down on the steps and knelt in front of Catherine. \"I'm serious. Come to New York with me. It's our last premiere in the States and it'd mean a lot to me if you'd be there.\" \"I have my interview.\" \"Not until Tuesday, we will be back by then. Please? All I kept thinking about in Vancouver is how much I wished that you were there to share it with me.\" \"But we're not public.\" \"You can come as my girlfriend or you can come as my friend, that's up to you. I don't care about any of that, all I care about is you being there with me. Please?\" Catherine couldn't say no to the face Jackie was making. She remembered how much it meant to her having Jackie at Stanford and knew she owed it to her to return the favor. She flashed her a big smile before saying \"Okay.\" \"You will?!\" Jackie's face lit up. \"Yes.\" She laughed. Jackie tackled her onto the floor, overcome with joy. They spent the next couple of days, happy as ever, in the place they had fallen in love. Jackie handled all of the travel arrangements for Catherine to join her in New York, while Catherine received more good news, an interview at UCLA. She decided it best to continue to just be friends in the public eye until she accepted a job. The day of their flight Catherine was feeling a little nervous about being thrown into the spotlight with Jackie. Once they were boarded on the plane, Jackie must have noticed her uneasiness because she took Catherine's hand. \"Everything's going to be okay.\" \"I'm fine with flying now, I've become quite the traveler lately,\" Catherine smiled. \"I don't mean the flight, I mean New York. I know this isn't easy for you, but I promise everything will be okay. We just need to make sure to communicate and be honest all weekend.\" Catherine knew this trip was going to be their first real test of how their life will be when they go public. However, after the last few days they had, she felt confident in the current state of their relationship. They spent the entire flight perfecting their stories of how they knew one another. When they landed, Rachel met them at the gate. \"Hey Rachel, this is my friend Catherine I was telling you about.\" After introducing themselves, Rachel went over their itinerary for the weekend. When they got to the hotel, she led them to their rooms. \"I figured Catherine would want her own since you'll be having hair and make up in and out of yours, so I booked one on the same floor.\" \"Is there not anything closer?\" asked Jackie. \"None that were available.\" \"Who's in the adjoining room next to me?\" \"Tommy.\" Catherine felt a surge of anger run through her but tried not to let it show. \"Can't Catherine just take his?\" \"Hello ladies.\" A voice behind them shouted. \"Speak of the devil,\" Rachel said as she turned around. \"Talking about how attractive I am again, are we?\" \"Hardly,\" Jackie blurt out. \"Tommy can you switch rooms with my friend Catherine so we can have adjoining rooms?\" \"Who, me and you?\" he winked. It was taking all Catherine had in her, not to punch this kid in the face. \"Funny. No, me and Catherine. She came to hang out with me so it'd be nice to be close.\" Jackie said, annoyed. \"Oh, hey Catherine. Nice to see you again. I'm glad someone else is here to handle Jackie's vomit\" he laughed. \"Tommy!\" Jackie interrupted, \"Will you or not?\" \"Yeah, sure, whatever. I see someone still has their panties in a twist.\" Jackie grabbed the card out of his hand, not bothering to reply to his remarks. Her and Catherine made their way into their rooms as Rachel reminded her that hair and make up would be there in an hour. Catherine rolled her eyes as soon as she closed her door. Dealing with Tommy was going to be a lot harder than she thought. After she had barely set her bags down on the bed, Jackie was already knocking at the adjoining door. She smiled as she opened it. \"Not bad huh?\" \"Not at all. I'm glad the room situations worked out though.\" Catherine smirked. \"Don't let him get to you, okay? I don't want him ruining this weekend.\" Jackie wrapped her arms around Catherine. \"I'll try not to, but he's not easy to like.\" Changing the subject, Jackie asked, \"So how should we spend our last hour alone before we have to pretend to be friends all weekend?\" \"I think we can think of something,\" Catherine smiled. When the hour was almost over, Jackie sat up on Catherine's bed. \"Before things get really crazy in there, don't lose sight of the fact that this is all just a job to me and a show I have to put on.\" \"I know,\" Catherine said, putting her hand up to Jackie's cheek. \"We were pretty good actors in Bloomington, I think we can handle this.\" Catherine winked. Moments later, hair and make up were pounding on Jackie's door. She kissed Catherine hard before slipping into her room. \"Here we go,\" Catherine whispered to herself.[Chapter 17] The moment Jackie opened the door, a handful of people came barging in. She greeted them all then introduced them to Catherine, who was standing timidly in the corner. \"This is my friend Catherine. She'll be hanging out with us all weekend.\" Catherine came over to shake their hands but they all ended up grabbing her and pulling her in for a hug. Jackie sat down in the chair and struggled to hold back her laughter. Catherine's reaction was priceless, she wasn't exactly what you'd call the hugging type. \"Well it was nice meeting you all, I'll let you get to work,\" Catherine said, inching her way back to her room. \"Don't leave! Come and have a seat,\" said Rachel, patting her hand on the bed. \"We never get to meet Jackie's friends, so this is a real treat.\" Jackie looked at Catherine through the mirror and smiled at her, Catherine smiled back and took a seat on the bed. She was relieved, considering Catherine wasn't too friendly the last time she brought her around a group of strangers. \"So Catherine, where are you from?\" asked Jackie's hairstylist, Sean. \"Bloomington, Indiana.\" \"How in the world do you know Jackie then?\" he asked. Without missing a beat Catherine replied, \"we met on campus while Jackie was attending college there.\" \"Jackie, you were a college girl?!\" Sean teased, gently tugging her hair. \"Yup. Just for a year though, then Neptune came knocking again.\" \"So tell me, what on earth is there to do in Bloomington, Indiana? What do you do for a living?\" He asked, turning his attention back to Catherine. \"Not much,\" she laughed. \"It's just your typical, Midwestern small town. I used to teach Psychology, but I'm planning on moving to California to work at a larger University.\" \"Good for you, moving to the fun side of country,\" he teased. \"Yeah, I actually lived in California for a little while, so am pretty excited to go back.\" \"I'm sure Jackie would love to have you in California with her. You two seem pretty tight lately, considering how much you've been traveling together.\" Rachel said. Jackie was nervous for a second, wondering if Rachel was starting to pick up on their act. \"Yeah well like I said, there's not much to do in Bloomington, so you become pretty close with the friends you make there.\" \"So, got any dirt on Jackie? Any embarrassing party stories?\" Sean asked, instigating Catherine. She sat and thought for a minute before a smile started expanding across her cheeks, \"did she tell you about the one time she almost got caught having sex in the library?\" All of their mouths dropped, before they burst into laughter. \"Jacqueline Kirk! You naughty girl!\" Sean teased, poking her in the back. Jackie covered her eyes with her hands, \"I hate you Stark. They're never going to let me live this down\" she laughed, her face turning bright red. \"See, this is exactly why we had you stay.\" Rachel said, slapping Catherine on the knee. \"I like this girl, Jackie.\" Jackie glanced at Catherine in the mirror and mouthed the words \"I hate you.\" Catherine just winked back. Jackie had never seen her be this open and fun with other people before. She continued to stare at Catherine and her friends through the mirror laughing and having fun, it gave her hope that the two of them could make this work. Suddenly there was a knock at the door, \"That must be PR,\" Rachel said. \"The fun's over guys, I'll go get Tommy.\" Jackie and Tommy's publicists made their way into the room and soon after, Rachel came back with Tommy. He smiled at Catherine and sat next to her before the publicists began their routine. \"Okay, basically the same questions as last time except they're going to bring up those tabloid photos of the two of you. Just keep saying what you've been saying, keeping the curiosity alive. Jackie, don't mention the amount of alcohol you had that night. It could do more harm to the both of you. Next thing you know they could be saying you have a drinking problem and Tommy took advantage of you.\" She glanced at Catherine in the mirror again but she wasn't looking. It was awkward having her in here for this, but she was glad she saw how persistent the publicists were. \"Jackie, got it?\" They asked. \"Yeah, okay,\" she responded solemnly. After they were done Jackie got dressed for the interviews. \"Hey everyone, can I have a second? I'll meet you all downstairs.\" Once she shut the door behind them, she turned around and smiled at Catherine on the bed. \"Look at you, Miss Social Butterfly\" Catherine smiled, biting her bottom lip. \"You have some pretty fun people surrounding you,\" she said, grabbing her arms and pulling her close. \"And you look absolutely gorgeous right now.\" Jackie bent down and kissed her, \"I have a surprise for you\" she whispered. \"And what's that?\" \"I made you a reservation upstairs at the hotel spa. The full treatment. Massage, manicure, pedicure, facial. Anything you want, just give them your name and everything's paid for.\" \"Jackie, you didn't have to do that.\" \"I felt bad leaving you here alone all day, so wanted to do something special. Feel free to order any room service too. But I have to get going, I love you,\" she said before kissing her one last time. \"I love you too.\" Jackie spent the next 8 hours traveling in and out of more radio stations than she could count. She texted Catherine half way through asking how the day was going. She texted her back a picture of her in a towel getting a message. Jackie replied, \"Glad I got you that phone ;) wish I was there :(\" \"Texting the boyfriend?\" Tommy asked. \"Boyfriend?!\" Rachel asked, \"So you tell Tommy but play coy with me? Not cool Jackie.\" \"You know I like to keep things private. And drunk Jackie told Tommy, not this version of myself.\" \"You're not getting off that easy, I'll get all the gritty details out of you soon enough,\" Rachel said. The premiere was only two days away, and Jackie was getting pretty nervous about having Catherine there to witness her and Tommy interacting for the fans. When they finally arrived back at the hotel after their strenuous day, Jackie asked Tommy if they could talk for a second. \"Yeah, what's up?\" He said. \"Look, I know they want us to keep up this charade and I'm fine with it. But can we maybe cool it down a bit? I'm in a relationship now and it's just not something I want thrown in their face.\" \"Jackie, come on,\" he sighed, \"It's our last big premiere here, let's end it with a bang.\" \"I know, and we can still have fun but just take it down notch, okay?\" \"Fine,\" he groaned, \"just a notch though\" he teased, in his typical annoying demeanor. \"Night Jacks.\" Jackie looked back at him, rolling her eyes, what a waste of a conversation. When she got to her room, the door to Catherine's was closed. She knocked softly and Catherine cracked it open, looking behind Jackie to see if anyone else was with her. \"It's just me,\" she smiled. Catherine opened the door and was wearing nothing but a robe. \"You look comfy,\" Jackie said, as she kissed her on the cheek. \"And I think I'm starting to develop a thing for bath robes,\" she smiled, as she looked her up and down. \"I am very comfy, and relaxed, thanks to you.\" \"I'm jealous, I wish I could have joined.\" \"How about your own personal massage?\" Catherine said smirking. \"That sounds wonderful, let me go get out of all of this,\" she said, motioning to her face and clothes. Jackie took a quick shower and when she came back out, Catherine was sitting on her bed with a glass of wine. \"Ohh, just what I need\" she said, grabbing the glass and taking a long sip. She was so happy to come back to company in her hotel room for once, it made unwinding that much easier. \"How was your day?\" Catherine asked. \"Exhausting, my cheeks hurt from smiling so much and my body aches from sitting in uncomfortable chairs all day.\" Catherine took the glass of wine from her hand and set it on the nightstand. \"Come on, lay down.\" Jackie laid down on her stomach and Catherine pulled her robe down to her waist. She began digging her hands into Jackie's back and shoulders. Jackie couldn't help but moan in pleasure, she hadn't had a massage in so long, it felt so good. \"Oh, so you moan for this?\" Catherine teased, as she continued to work her hands into Jackie's tight muscles. After a few minutes she bent down and looked at Jackie's face. She was sound asleep. Catherine covered her up with the blankets then curled up next to her, after turning off the lights. At 6 a.m. there was a pounding at the door. Jackie and Catherine both jumped up. \"Shit!\" Jackie whispered. \"Jackie! Wake up!\" Rachel was yelling from outside the door. Catherine hurried out of bed and tiptoed back into her room as Jackie put her robe back on. \"I'm up!\" She said, as soon as she swung open the door. The same usual morning routine took place; hair, make up, and lots of coffee. Catherine came in about an hour later and they all began joking around again. \"Catherine, why don't you join us today. I could use someone to talk to while Jackie and Tommy are doing press all day.\" Rachel suggested. Catherine crinkled her forehead, \"Are you sure I wouldn't be getting in the way?\" \"Not at all! Pleeeaasse! It'd be nice hanging out with a normal person for once.\" \"Hey! I find offense to that!\" Jackie cried out. \"Okay, I'll come,\" she laughed. Jackie was thrilled that Catherine got to be there with her all day, even though they didn't get much time together. As her and Tommy made their way through the endless press junket interviews, Catherine and Rachel bonded. On their way back, things started to get awkward when Tommy kept hitting on Jackie in the limo. She kept pushing him away and telling him to stop. \"You're going to come around again once you get rid of that douche bag. What the hell happened to you? You used to be fun.\" She couldn't believe this was happening in front of Catherine and didn't know what to say. All of a sudden Catherine chimed in, \"She's still pretty fun, if you ask me.\" \"Oh really? Well you ladies are going to have to prove that to me at the after party tomorrow night. Maybe me and Jacks can end the night like we did last week, and you can join too Catherine,\" he winked. \"Sorry, I don't waste my time on little boys\" Catherine snapped. The entire limo started laughing and giving Catherine high fives, as Tommy sat there silent. \"Tommy, silent? This is a first,\" Rachel laughed. Jackie subtly grabbed her hand and gave it a squeeze, smiling at her. Obviously Catherine wasn't letting Tommy get to her. As they pulled up to the hotel Rachel snapped back into assistant mode, \"Alright everyone, we don't have any time to spare so get up into hair and make up and meet down in the lobby at 6 p.m. sharp, the limos will be waiting to take you to dinner.\" When they got to the restaurant, Tommy sat across the table from Jackie. While he continued to lay on the charm, Catherine slipped her hand on Jackie's thigh under the table. Jackie tensed up a bit, causing Tommy to shoot her a questionable look. \"Cold chill\" she said. Catherine then proceeded to slide her hand up Jackie's dress and gave her thigh a squeeze. Jackie flashed her an alarming look as Catherine just smiled innocently back. What the heck is she doing, Jackie thought to herself. She slipped her hand under the table, removed Catherine's hand from her thigh, and held it. She continued to talk to Tommy while she ran her thumb over Catherine's hand. As nerve wrecking as it was, it was pretty hot. Little did they know Rachel, who was sitting on the other side of Jackie, saw the entire thing. After a few minutes Catherine excused herself to the bathroom, asking for directions. Jackie rose from her chair and said she'd join her. As soon as she followed her into the bathroom, Catherine checked the stalls then pushed her against the wall and began kissing her. \"Catherine, you're killing me out there!\" Catherine smiled and playfully bit her lip. \"I'm just trying to be an optimist and find the perks of sneaking around,\" she said as she began kissing Jackie's neck. All of a sudden the door opened and Rachel walked in. Catherine grabbed Jackie's necklace, \"your necklace is gorgeous, you should ask if you can keep it. Oh hey Rachel!\" she winked back at Jackie before disappearing into a stall. \"Enjoying your night?\" Rachel asked. \"Yeah, it's okay.\" Jackie said, trying to keep her composure. When they returned to the table Tommy was quick to make another snarky comment, \"what's with girls always having to go to the bathroom together?\" \"We make the best kind of company.\" Catherine grinned. Jackie shot her a look as Tommy directed his focus to Catherine. \"So Catherine, have you met Jackie's secret boyfriend yet?\" Catherine looked at Jackie and smiled big, placing her hand back on her thigh and giving it another squeeze. \"I sure have.\" \"So what is he like? Is he as insecure as Jackie makes him seem?\" Jackie choked on her water. \"Does she now?\" Catherine looked over at her but Jackie didn't make eye contact. This was heading into a direction that she wasn't thrilled with. \"Yeah, she wants me to take the public flirting down a notch tomorrow night, said he's a jealous guy. Can you blame him though? I mean, she's with my fine piece of ass more than she's with him, I'd be worried too.\" \"You know, he doesn't strike me as jealous. I just don't think he appreciates his girlfriend being degraded and forced to sell herself to the media. All for the sake of what? A few more movie ticket sales?\" Jackie grabbed the bottle of wine to pour herself another glass but Catherine stopped her. \"Are you sure that's a good idea?\" she asked. \"Yeah Jacks, we know what happens when you drink too much wine around me.\" He winked. \"Catherine, load her up!\" He teased. Catherine filled both of their glasses, \"why not. I'm up for a fun night.\" \"Now we're talking!\" Tommy shouted. \"So Catherine, what's this guy like? Can I take him?\" Jackie shut her eyes, wanting this conversation to end. \"Can we please stop talking about this.\" \"Come on Jacks, we're just having a little fun.\" Tommy said. \"Yeah Jacks ,\" Catherine said sarcastically, \"but I think you should take this one.\" Jackie could feel Catherine staring at her. The blood was rushing to her head and she began to become more angry than anything. She was fed up with Tommy's comments and the entire situation that presented itself. \"Yeah, you've been pretty quiet about this guy. Is he really worth ruining all this fun we've been having?\" That was it. Jackie snapped her head up at Tommy. \"He's tall, blonde, has the prettiest brown eyes I've ever seen and an amazing body. Extremely intelligent. Confident, but has a good heart. And most of all, he's worth throwing this entire thing away for. He's the whole package and I wish you two would stop making light of this situation.\" Jackie said as she got up and stormed out of the restaurant. \"So pretty much the opposite of you, Tommy.\" Catherine said bluntly before taking one final sip of her wine, then getting up and following Jackie. Jackie leaned against a wall down the street with her arms crossed, she saw Catherine approaching her from the corner of her eye. \"What the hell was that!\" Jackie yelled. \"I'm sorry but I hate that guy, he's such a little jackass.\" \"It's not funny what you did in there. You went too far.\" \"And he didn't? Do you know how hard it's been watching him throw himself at you all day, acting like he owns you? How many times is he going to say that you'll come back to him. Do you know how irritating that is? Especially knowing that you two were fuck buddies until recently?\" \"I know. I'm sorry. You being here was supposed to make it easier though, not harder.\" Jackie said, staring Catherine in the eyes, still angry. \"You're so hot when you're mad. Especially after all of those things you just said about me,\" Catherine smiled, coming closer. \"Stop!\" Jackie pushed her away but couldn't help to smile. Catherine just looked at her with that devilish little smirk she always had, and her adorable dimples that made Jackie go crazy. \"Let's go back to the hotel,\" Jackie said, grabbing Catherine's hand before running towards the street for a cab. \"Jackie what about the part-\" before she could finish Jackie had a cab open and drug her into it. She told the driver which hotel, then began making out with Catherine right there in the back seat of the cab. For the first time in her life she didn't care that someone was watching. Something had taken over her body and she couldn't control it anymore. When they reached the hotel they straightened their dresses before stepping out of the cab. They walked as fast as they could through the lobby into the elevator. \"Don't you even think about it, there's cameras,\" Jackie warned, smiling. Catherine kept staring at her with that look. \"This is torture!\" She whispered. After what felt like the longest elevator ride of their lives, they borderline ran to their room. Catherine pushed Jackie against the door once it was closed. Jackie tore Catherine's dress off then worked on her own as they clumsily made their way over to the bed. Her leg got caught in her dress in the process, causing her to fall, smashing hard into the floor. They both started laughing uncontrollably, obviously they both had a little too much wine at dinner. Catherine kissed her knee then helped her up, but as soon as she was to her feet she pushed Catherine down on the bed. This new found confidence transferred itself into bed with her. She took the lead first and nibbled on Catherine's bottom lip before going further. Catherine was obviously enjoying this new side of her because her moans were getting a little excessive, more so than usual. Jackie placed her hand over Catherine's mouth and whispered, laughing \"shhhhh! you're going to get us caught!\" The feel of Catherine's warm breath and moans vibrating on her hand were sending her over the edge. Finally, Catherine grabbed her and pinned her beneath her. Jackie grabbed a pillow and pressed it hard onto her face, knowing the others could be back at anytime. Sure enough, just as she was finishing there was a knock at her door.[Chapter 18] Catherine heard the knock and looked up at Jackie. They both stared at each other in silence, not moving a muscle until there was another knock. \"Jackie, open up! Come on, I know you're in there! The receptionist said she saw you come in!\" Rachel shouted. \"Shit!\" Jackie mouthed to Catherine. \"One sec!\" She called out. She rolled out of bed, grabbed her robe and began collecting their clothes that were scattered all over the room. Catherine got up and began to help but then noticed Jackie's appearance. Her hair was tousled and make up smeared. She had lipstick marks all over her face, trailing down her neck. Catherine grabbed her and took her over to the mirror. Once Jackie saw her reflection her eyes grew big, she was frozen in place not knowing what to do. Catherine mouthed, \"sorry!\" as she looked at her through the mirror, but couldn't help the laughter that suddenly overcame her. She held her hands tight over her mouth before going to the sink to retrieve a wash cloth. She wiped Jackie's face and neck the best she could then tried fixing her hair before giving her the okay. Jackie cracked the door open, making sure not to let Rachel barge in as she usually did. \"Hey, sorry I was in the bathroom.\" \"You had me worried! No one could find you and you wouldn't answer my calls. You can't just disappear in New York City without any security!\" \"I know, I'm sorry. I was really embarrassed about how I acted at dinner and didn't want to show my face.\" Rachel was studying her closely, \"what the hell happened to you? It looks like you got into a fight, and did I hear crying?\" \"N-Nothing,\" Jackie stuttered, as she nervously smoothed down her hair with her hand. \"I was in the process of getting a shower.\" \"Oh, okay,\" Rachel said, still looking at her suspiciously. \"Well, I guess I'll leave you alone. You have the morning off, just make sure you're back here by 3 for hair and make-up.\" \"Got it. Goodnight Rachel, sorry again for worrying you.\" Jackie closed the door and looked through the peep hole before letting out a sigh of relief. Catherine was standing in the doorway between their rooms, looking at her, smiling. \"Talk about a close call.\" \"TOO close,\" Jackie responded. The next morning they woke early, Jackie had half the day off for them to take full advantage of New York. Catherine couldn't wait to be alone with her during the daylight. The mere six hours they were getting alone while they slept wasn't enough. Once she was done getting ready, she headed into Jackie's room where she saw her wearing a hooded sweatshirt and pulling on a baseball hat. Jackie grabbed her sunglasses from the sink then turned around to face her, \"do I look like Jacqueline Kirk?\" \"No. You look like small town college student Jackie,\" Catherine smiled. \"My favorite version of you.\" \"Mine too,\" Jackie said, returning the smile. After deciding that having a driver would increase their chances of being noticed, they made their way downstairs to haul a cab. Since time was of the essence, they chose to take a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty, something neither of them had done. After grabbing a quick bite to eat at a bagel shop, they headed down to the dock. With her coffee in one hand, Jackie grabbed Catherine's hand with the other. A small gesture to anyone else, was something huge for them. To walk down the street in public, like an ordinary couple, was something that they had never been able to experience. Catherine wrinkled her nose at Jackie and smiled at the sweet gesture. No one had even looked twice at Jackie since leaving the hotel, so they were taking full advantage of being in a city where no one knew them. For once they could just be themselves out in the open. As they boarded the boat and began sailing to the island, Catherine looked over at Jackie. Jackie's hand was resting on Catherine's knee, gently circling it with her finger tips as she stared out at the city. She suddenly turned and caught Catherine staring at her. \"What?\" She asked curiously, uncomfortably laughing. \"Nothing,\" Catherine replied, \" just enjoying this moment.\" Jackie smiled and leaned over to kiss her. Once they docked at the island, they made their way up to the top of the Statue of Liberty. The moment the elevator opened, they both gasped at the view. Jackie eagerly walked out and leaned into the railing as Catherine stayed back, uneasy with the height. When Jackie noticed she reached out her hand, \"come on.\" \"I'm good back here,\" Catherine nervously answered. Heights, among other things, were not something she was good with. \"You don't want to miss this view, trust me. I won't let you fall.\" She reached her hand out again and Catherine timidly walked over. She held tight to the railing, the wind wasn't exactly helping her anxiety. Jacked leaned her head over and looked down. \"Stop!\" Catherine yelled, grabbing her. Jackie started laughing, \"you really are terrified, aren't you?\" \"Shut up.\" Catherine said, unamused. She despised the feeling of not having control. Jackie took her hat and sunglasses off, \"can we at least get a picture before we go?\" Catherine looked at her, not wanting to move even an inch, let alone turn her back to the railing. \"Please?\" Jackie pleaded. \"Fine,\" Catherine sighed. She slowly turned, one arm grasping the railing behind her while she held tightly onto Jackie with the other. \"Excuse me,\" Jackie said to a woman standing near them, \"could you take a picture for us?\" The second after the woman snapped the picture, Jackie jolted Catherine's shoulders, quietly shouting \"AH!\" Catherine jumped and ran back against the wall, visibly shaken. So much so that she couldn't even yell at Jackie. She began breathing heavily, grasping her chest. Jackie was hysterically laughing which wasn't helping the situation. Her laughing began to cease as she looked at Catherine. She came over to her, and tried to hug her but Catherine pushed her away. \"Don't touch me, you asshole,\" she managed to say, while still finding it difficult to breathe. \"Come on, I was just kidding around.\" Catherine glared at her, \"not funny.\" Jackie hugged her again, this time she let her. Mostly because she needed the comfort. \"Jesus Christ Catherine, you're trembling. I'm sorry.\" She held her close for a moment until Catherine felt herself calm down. \"Can we just get down from here?\" \"Yeah, come on.\" Jackie grabbed her hand and led her into the elevator. Catherine stayed silent the entire way down, still fairly upset with Jackie. Once they reached the bottom and began their way back to the boat, Jackie stopped her in her tracks. \"Are you seriously mad at me?\" When Catherine didn't answer, Jackie got in front of her and held her wrists. \"You can't stay mad at me forever, this was supposed to be a fun day date.\" Catherine looked up at her this time, still supplying an angry face. \"Come on Schnookums!\" Jackie grinned. \"Don't you dare smile. Don't do it!\" Between Jackie calling her Schnookums and teasing her not to smile, Catherine couldn't prevent her lips from curling up despite how hard she tried. \"I hate you.\" \"No you don't. But I am really sorry. Lesson learned, no more pranks.\" \"I'll believe that when I see it.\" After the boat ride back to the city, they were able to squeeze in a little shopping before having to return to the hotel. While they goofing around enjoying their time, Jackie randomly blurted out, \"be my girlfriend tonight.\" Catherine looked at her, \"right.\" \"I'm serious.\" Jackie was looking at her sincerely. \"You know we can't, you have to finish this thing with Tommy and-\" \"Fuck Tommy! This day has been perfect. I'm sick of us having to suffer for the sake of other people's ignorances.\" Catherine realized Jackie was being completely serious. \"As much as I want to, you know we can't. It's not even just about other people, it's about us. Both of our careers could suffer.\" \"I don't care. A job doesn't make me as happy as you do,\" Jackie said, taking hold of both of her hands. All Catherine could do was offer a heartfelt smile. \"I know. We have to be logical about this though and think this all out before just jumping into it, especially at a premiere. I'll be there for you tonight. Physically, for once. We know what we have, that's what really matters.\" Jackie dropped her hands, obviously upset. \"Come on, don't end the day like this. We just need to have a little more patience.\" Catherine said, pushing the bill of her hat down in an attempt to lighten the mood. Jackie smiled as she readjusted her hat, \"Fine. Well I guess we better head back to our fake life now,\" she sighed. When they got back to the hotel, the redundant chaos of getting ready began. Sean had a friend come help get Catherine and Rachel red carpet ready, separating them from Jackie. \"I gotta tell ya Catherine, it's been nice having you here. Jackie's been in such a better mood.\" \"Really?\" Catherine asked, it felt good knowing other people could see a difference in Jackie's demeanor just by her being around. \"Yeah, I mean except for last night. What was that all about? When I got up here I thought I heard muffled crying, and she looked a mess.\" Catherine panicked, that certainly wasn't crying she heard. \"She was really upset about her boyfriend, and the public facade she has to put on with Tommy isn't helping.\" \"I figured as much. I feel bad for her. She's caught in a tough spot between the two of them.\" \"What do you mean?\" Catherine asked, curiously. \"She finally confided in me the other day after being tight lipped about her relationship. All she wants is her boyfriend to be around, but he doesn't want to be a part of this lifestyle. Then you have PR basically forcing her to be with Tommy, but she feels guilty doing that as well. Damned if she does, damned if she doesn't.\" Catherine felt awful. She didn't realize she had been adding to Jackie's stress equally as much as the others had been. She thought back to last night and then earlier today, no wonder Jackie just wanted to end the entire charade. After they were finished with Rachel she got up from the chair, \"I better get back in there with Jackie, looking good so far Catherine!\" \"Thanks, you look great!\" Even after hair and make-up were done with Catherine, she stayed in her own room and finished getting ready. She didn't want to get in the way of the chaos that was surrounding Jackie. By the time she finally entered Jackie's room they were zipping her up and putting on her jewelry. She was absolutely stunning but Catherine couldn't help to notice how unhappy she looked. In that moment, she wanted nothing more than to take the pain away.[Chapter 19] \"My God Catherine, you are gorgeous!\" Sean proclaimed, as soon as she stepped into the room. Jackie's head perked up and she looked over, allowing her eyes to slowly trail down Catherine's body then back up until their eyes met. Jackie's somber face immediately lit up as the two exchanged a smile. \"Yeah she is\" Jackie chimed in. \"Thanks. I'm just trying my hardest to look half as good as Jackie,\" she winked. \"Honey please, don't make this girl's head get any bigger,\" Sean joked, poking at Jackie. Rachel's phone rang over everyone's laughter, \"Are we almost done here? That was the limo, he's downstairs.\" \"Yes, just a little more hairspray and we're all set\" Sean said, spraying Jackie's hair one final time. Catherine was hoping to get a minute alone with Jackie but before she knew it, the entire posse was heading out the door with Jackie caught in the middle. As they approached the limo, it was requested that Tommy and Jackie sit alone in back in order to be ready for the cameras. Catherine filed in with the others and tried to exchange a smile with Jackie, but she seemed preoccupied. When they were all seated she glanced at her again but Jackie was staring out the window, her hands fidgeting with her purse. She was obviously distressed and it was killing Catherine not being able to check in with her. Jackie stared out the window, her stomach in knots. In a few short minutes she would be entering her Hollywood world, and Catherine was going to be there with a front row seat. She was too nervous to even make eye contact with her, considering she was sitting next to Tommy. Suddenly she felt a hand on her leg, it was his. She nervously looked up at him. \"Are we cool?\" He asked. \"Yeah. I'm just a little uneasy, these never get easier.\" \"You know you always loosen up after a few minutes. You'll be fine.\" Jackie smiled at him, \"Yeah, I know. Thanks Tommy.\" She finally looked over at Catherine, who was looking back with a smile on her face. There was so much the two of them wanted to say to one another and it was becoming painful not being able to do so. Before they even arrived to the red carpet they could hear the crowd roaring down the street. Tommy leaned down to the fridge and grabbed some mini bottles, asking if anyone else wanted one. \"Yes please\" Jackie desperately replied. Tommy threw one to each person in the limo, \"Come on guys! Last U.S. premiere!\" Everyone reluctantly opened their bottles and cheered to Neptune 26. Jackie chugged her bottle in one fluid motion as Catherine struggled drinking just a sip of hers, covering her mouth at the potency of it. Jackie leaned over and grabbed it from her before finishing that one as well, as Catherine looked back in shock. \"All right you two, get ready to go,\" Rachel said, directing her attention to Jackie and Tommy. \"Here take some mints, we don't need your fans and the reporters smelling the vodka on your breath.\" As soon as she the car pulled up a man in a tuxedo opened the door. Tommy got out first, then held his hand out for Jackie as she nervously looked back at Catherine before exiting. \"Breathe\" was the last thing she heard before stepping out into the pandemonium. As Catherine exited the limo she was suddenly caught up in the tornado of a Hollywood event. People were everywhere with headsets and clip boards, shouting so loudly that she was unsure how anyone could understand them. No wonder Jackie needed the liquid courage, to say this was overwhelming was an understatement. Sean was touching up Jackie's lipstick as she approached them, but her and Tommy were quickly pulled away as soon as she reached them. \"A lot to take in huh?\" Catherine heard Rachel say from behind her. \"Very much so.\" She replied. \"Just stay with me, we'll be trailing in the background while they work their magic.\" Before hitting the reporters they entered a tunnel of fans. Jackie and Tommy were both making their way through the line, signing autographs and taking pictures with the crowd. One fan was hysterically crying and Catherine watched on as Jackie leaned over and gave her a hug. Right after, she knelt down to a young girl who was wearing a Tyler shirt and took her picture with her. She was so good with her fans, it warmed Catherine's heart seeing the exchange. Rachel went and grabbed Jackie and Tommy to bring them back to be touched up yet again, before they went in front of the cameras. Jackie's cheery demeanor dropped as soon as she was away from the fans. Rachel took notice, \"What's up Jacks?\" \"Nothing.\" she said shortly. Her publicist overheard the conversation and cut in, \"You need to drop this attitude right now before you get in front of those cameras and reporters. And would it kill you to smile today?\" \"Can you just get off my back for once!\" Jackie snapped back. \"Jackie shhh, calm down. You don't want to make a scene here,\" Rachel said, putting herself in between Jackie and the publicist. \"Just let her be, I'll take care of this.\" Catherine was taken aback by Jackie's behavior and decided to interrupt, \"Do you mind if I talk to her alone for a minute?\" \"Please do.\" Rachel said, before stepping away. \"What's going on?\" She asked. Jackie stayed silent as she clenched her jaw and looked off to the side. \"Hey, talk to me.\" It was extremely difficult to remember not to touch her. \"Give it thirty minutes and you'll see, that is if you're still talking to me at that point\" she said solemnly, still not making eye contact. Catherine hated the fact that her being there was negatively affecting Jackie so much. She looked around knowing anyone could be eavesdropping, then leaned forward to whisper in her ear. \"I'm here to support you, not make things difficult. This is your job. Do it for those fans I just saw you light up for. Do what you need to do to make them happy.\" Jackie finally looked her in the eyes. \"Go on Porcupine.\" She leaned into her one last time, \"I know who you're going home with tonight, that's all that matters.\" Jackie finally cracked a smile, \"you're such a tease,\" she whispered. Catherine flashed her a smirk, hoping their talk was enough to snap her back into her movie star role. As Jackie walked away, she felt a sense of relief rush through her body. She was under immense pressure to make the fans, media, publicists and Tommy happy which in return, would all directly hurt Catherine. The only person she wanted to make happy. \"Everything good now?\" Rachel asked. \"Yeah, I'm sorry.\" After reaching the photographers, she posed on her own for a bit as the fans screamed in admiration. She finally began to feel at ease and gain the confidence she would need for the interviews. Tommy stepped in and joined her which made the crowd even louder. He placed his arm around Jackie's waist and held her closely, as Jackie smiled big. He turned and kissed her on the cheek, at this point the screams were deafening. \"I know he can be a jackass, but you can't deny the fact that they look pretty great together. The fans adore them.\" Rachel said, staring at Jackie and Tommy. \"So I see,\" was all Catherine could respond. She couldn't help but wonder what it would be like if she ever joined Jackie at a premiere as her girlfriend. Would the fans adore them as much as they adore Jackie and Tommy? \"Are you okay?\" Rachel asked. Catherine obviously needed to work on her poker face. \"Yeah, just a little overwhelmed.\" \"Only a little while longer, then we can all have some much needed drinks,\" they both laughed. After pictures Jackie was led straight into interviews. She hadn't even attempted to talk, let alone look at Catherine, the entire red carpet. Catherine realized she was busy so tried not to let it bother her, but she wasn't liking the fact that she had left her to fend for herself. Jackie knew how nervous she was about this all and wasn't offering the same support she had given her. Perhaps Jackie was teaching her a lesson for not allowing them to be public yet. As Jackie made her way through each reporter Catherine was able to stay close behind her, hearing every word. \"So how is the romance department? Anyone special in your life? Tommy perhaps?\" Jackie laughed. \"That's the million dollar question isn't it?\" She was given this question, in varying forms, from every single reporter on the carpet. It was all starting to become too much for Catherine, but she knew the pressure Jackie was under and needed to follow through on the pep talk she had given her. Because of this, she thought it was best to take a breather, distancing herself from the group. \"I like to keep my personal life private but I'm in a very happy place right now,\" Jackie responded to the reporter. \"Is this a hint that maybe Tommy is the cause of this happiness?\" Reporters were relentless at the subject. Jackie laughed again, \"We had a blast filming the movie, and are having so much fun together promoting it. The fans and media will believe what they want to believe, but like I said before, my personal life is going to stay private.\" After she thanked the reporter she was offered a tiny break until the next one opened up. Things had moved so quickly that she was relieved to be given a moment to check in with Catherine, but when she turned back to talk to her, she was no where to be found. \"Where's Catherine?\" she asked Rachel. \"She stepped away for a minute, I think this is all a little much for her.\" Jackie began skimming her eyes through the crowd, suddenly realizing how lost Catherine must feel. \"Buy me some time please?\" Before Rachel could respond, Jackie disappeared behind her.[Chapter 20] Catherine walked to the back of the red carpet, keeping a close eye on Jackie's posse so she wouldn't lose them. In an attempt to calm herself, she pulled out her cell phone and began checking her email. After a few moments had past, she felt a hand on her shoulder. When she turned, she saw Jackie standing there. \"I'm so sorry. Are you okay?\" Jackie asked, concerned. As Catherine parted her lips to respond, she saw Rachel approaching them. \"I think you're needed,\" she nodded. Jackie whirled around and spoke before Rachel had the chance to, \"One minute Rachel, I promise. One minute.\" She turned back around to face Catherine once Rachel reluctantly walked away. \"This is all moving a lot faster than it usually does, and it's safe to say I haven't mastered the concept of bringing a date to these things. Let alone a secret one,\" Jackie offered a small, guilt-ridden smile. Catherine realized how selfish she was being for assuming Jackie was playing games with her. Rachel appeared behind her again, this time looking angry. \"Okay, we're coming,\" Jackie said, grabbing Catherine's hand. \"Time to dip your toes into this, follow my lead\" Jackie whispered to her, before going in front of another reporter. Once again, Jackie was asked about her relationship status. \"Actually, I brought a date with me tonight.\" Jackie turned around and grabbed Catherine's arm, asking her to join them. Catherine's heart beat fast as Jackie pulled her into the interview. She was completely blindsided and couldn't believe this was how it was all going to go down. She wasn't ready. \"This is my good friend Catherine.\" As soon as Jackie called her a good friend, she felt her heart begin to steady. Thank God. \"It's nice to meet you Catherine, is this your first time at a premiere?\" he asked. Although the shock of possibly being outed wore off, Catherine suddenly realized she was still being interviewed on a red carpet. \"Yes it is,\" she replied nervously. \"Am I being that obvious?\" The reporter laughed, \"It was very sweet of Jackie to bring you.\" \"Yes it was, she's a great friend.\" Catherine said, exchanging a smile with Jackie. \"Jackie, how do you manage to stay so grounded? Especially looking at how most child stars have turned out?\" He asked. \"I just try to live life as normal as possible. I prefer to live a quiet lifestyle. I was actually made fun of when I attended college last year, when they found out I had never been to any crazy Hollywood parties.\" \"So all of those drug rumors years ago were false?\" \"Completely. I was suffering a loss and needed to take a step out of the limelight for a while. I'm a very private person and failed to provide any reasoning for my exit, so everyone just assumed the worst.\" Catherine gently squeezed Jackie's arm, offering a bit of support since it was all she could do. \"So what's next for Jacqueline Kirk?\" \"I've been on a few auditions and I would really like to take some more college courses this fall.\" Catherine was shocked at Jackie's response. She had no idea she was thinking about college still, and was proud of her for not losing sight of what she really wanted. All of a sudden Tommy snuck in next to Jackie. \"There's the man of the hour,\" the reporter excitedly said, as he shifted his focus to Tommy. From then on it became the Jackie and Tommy show. \"There were some photographs taken of the two of you slipping home together last premiere. Care to elaborate?\" \"We all stay at the same hotel and share the same limo. We leave together every night,\" Jackie quickly responded. \"Well you two were looking rather cozy,\" the reporter nagged on. Tommy slipped his arm around Jackie's waist, pulling her towards him and away from Catherine. \"What are you insinuating?\" He winked. Catherine's temper started to flare, she absolutely loathed the way he controlled Jackie and these interviews. Jackie quickly slipped out of Tommy's embrace and grasped Catherine's hand, pulling her closer. \"I've got my best friend here with me tonight. The only thing on my mind is having an awesome time with her\" Jackie said, winking at Catherine. Judging by the looks on Tommy and the PR teams faces, they weren't happy with Jackie's remark. She smiled big and squeezed Catherine's hand before Rachel interrupted, letting them know it was time to make their way into the theater. Jackie looked over at Catherine and flashed her a smile. Not just any smile though. One that made Catherine feel like despite the thousands of people surrounding them, Jackie only saw her.[Chapter 21] Catherine was completely in awe, sitting in the theater watching Neptune 26. Jackie was a natural and had gotten even better since the cheesy cult show. She squeezed her hand as they watched as a sign of her admiration. It was an interesting feeling, getting to see what she was up to the entire time they were apart. They both clearly submerged themselves into their work, something they both had in common. Afterward, the cast of the movie went up on stage and conducted a short Q&A; session. Jackie was absolutely glowing up there, radiating a confidence that Catherine didn't get to see often. Jackie couldn't remember another time in her life when she had ever felt so complete. Here she was, at the premiere of a movie she was the star of, with someone she was crazy about, being there supporting her. She felt such a rush on stage, and looking down and seeing Catherine in the audience made it even more perfect. Her smile was infectious and it only fed into Jackie's exuberance as she spoke to the crowd. Once the session ended, she met up with Catherine and followed the rest of the cast and crew to the after party. \"So what did you think?\" She asked. \"Be honest.\" \"I'm not even exaggerating when I say you've drastically improved, and you were great to begin with. It was so good, I'm so proud of you,\" Catherine beamed, as she wrapped her arms around Jackie and hugged her tight. \"I'm so glad you came, it means so much to me.\" Jackie said, before whispering in her ear, \"it literally has been causing me physical pain not being able to touch you all day. And you smell really good.\" Catherine laughed as she released her embrace, \"Except for that little stunt with Tommy and the reporter.\" \"I had to control myself, you're lucky all I did was hold your hand,\" she laughed. Jackie had been tempted to lay it all out on the line, right there in front of the reporter, but knew she couldn't do something that extreme without Catherine's consent. It was one thing to handle Tommy's advances alone, but with Catherine around, she refused. Thank God all these Neptune events were coming to an end. As soon as they entered the party Jackie grabbed two glasses of champagne from a waiter who greeted them at the door. \"Let me know if this all becomes a bit too much for you.\" \"Okay,\" Catherine responded, sipping her champagne and soaking in the atmosphere. \"I'm serious. Just say the word.\" \"I will,\" Catherine smiled. What a difference a year and a half had made. After introducing Catherine to most of the cast and crew, Jackie headed to the bar. \"I'm going to go get us a couple more drinks, be back in a sec,\" she told Catherine. As she was waiting on the drinks, she felt someone's arms wrap around her waist. She knew damn well Catherine wouldn't be that forward in public, so knew exactly who it was. She turned around, Tommy's face was inches away from hers and she could smell the liquor on his breath. She grabbed his arms and pushed him off of her. \"Tommy, don't even start.\" \"Come on Jacks, it's been so long. I miss you\" he said, putting his hands on her again. \"Tommy, stop it!\" She shouted, trying to push him off. Catherine was talking with Rachel and a few other cast mates when she spotted Tommy approaching Jackie at the bar. She kept a close eye on them as she pretended to listen. Tommy wrapped his arms around Jackie and Catherine could feel her jaw clench and her skin begin to radiate. She saw Jackie push him off but then he grabbed her again. \"Excuse me,\" Catherine said, making her way over to the bar. As she got close she heard Jackie yelling at Tommy to stop. Without even giving it a second thought she grabbed Tommy's arm and pulled him off of Jackie. \"She said no Tommy.\" \"Hey Catherine, what about you. Want to get out of here later?\" \"In your dreams\". Jackie ran off to the restroom. \"Leave her alone Tommy. I'm serious.\" Catherine warned, pointing a finger in his face before going to find Jackie. When she got to the restroom it was empty except for the handicap stall. \"Jackie? Are you in there?\" She asked, knocking softly on the door. Jackie opened it and pulled her in. As soon as the door was locked she hugged Catherine. \"Are you okay Porcupine?\" Catherine asked, holding her closely. Jackie didn't say a word, just hugged her tighter. \"What did you ever see in that guy?\" she asked. \"Convenience, and a way to numb the loneliness.\" Catherine's heart broke a little at her words, but knew exactly what she meant. They both had a rough year without each other. The door opened and Rachel called out their names, asking if they were in there. Catherine opened the stall door. \"What's going on?\" She asked. \"Tommy being Tommy.\" Catherine replied. \"Are you okay?\" Rachel asked Jackie. \"Yeah\" she responded, shaking off her mood. \"Let's go get those drinks now\" she said, taking both of their hands and leading them out of the restroom. \"Excuse me sir, can we have some shots with these drinks?\" \"Shots?\" Catherine asked, raising her eyebrows. \"Yes. We're partying tonight\" she grinned. After three shots Catherine cut them off. Jackie attempted to drag her onto the dance floor but she managed to stop at the side, she was no where near drunk enough for that. Jackie and Rachel sure were though. They danced their little hearts out and kept calling out for her to join. \"I'm good right here!\" She laughed. This was the first time she had ever seen Jackie act her actual age and it was quite amusing. She deserved to have a good time and Catherine wasn't going to prevent her from doing so tonight. After a few songs they came back out to get more drinks. Jackie ordered another round of shots. \"None for me,\" Catherine told her. Jackie turned to Rachel, \"Stark can't hang\" she teased. Catherine scowled at her then grabbed both her and Jackie's shots, downing them both in mere seconds. \"I stand corrected,\" Jackie said, staring at her in amazement. \"I'm impressed, but now you owe me a shot.\" \"Here take mine, I need to slow down\" Rachel said, slurring her words and sliding the glass over to Jackie. \"I need to use the ladies room.\" As soon as Rachel left, Jackie eyed Catherine seductively and scooted closer. \"You better behave tonight,\" Catherine warned, smirking. \"Well if you keep looking at me like that I can't make any promises.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Catherine said, biting her lip. Jackie stared at her bottom lip then swung around to the bartender, \"shot!\" She yelled. Catherine laughed, \"She'll have a beer.\" \"I'll have a shot and a beer,\" Jackie said to the bartender, before looking back at her annoyed. Her eyes grew big again, \"Stop looking at me like that!\" \"I'm not doing anything!\" \"Those fucking dimples!\" she muttered. As Rachel was walking back from the restroom, the song changed on the dance floor. \"I love this song!\" Jackie yelled excitedly, slamming her beer down. Obviously she was already quite inebriated. Her and Rachel started dancing together before ordering another drink and moving back to the dance floor. Catherine began mingling around with some of the people she had met earlier, making small talk while sipping her drink. The alcohol definitely contributed to this, considering she didn't have much in common with any of these people. She was surprisingly enjoying herself though. When she felt herself getting fairly intoxicated she stopped, she didn't trust both her and Jackie not having control over themselves. Looking out to the dance floor she noticed Jackie starting to wind down, this wasn't a complete surprise considering how much she had drank, not to mention how late it was. The two caught eyes and Jackie grinned at her, sticking her finger out in a come-hither motion. Catherine smiled and worked her way through the now thinning crowd. Without saying a word, Jackie turned and scooted up against her, dancing. \"We're both too drunk for this,\" Catherine bent down and whispered. \"Come on, let's go get you some water.\" She took her hand and led her to the bar, running into Rachel on the way. \"Hey the limo is leaving in about 20 minutes, meet out front.\" After getting water, Catherine took her to the restroom. Jackie stumbled out of the stall and struggled to wash her hands. She leaned against the wall and her eyes began to close. After Catherine was finished she went over and shook her shoulders, \"Jackie wake up.\" She slowly cracked her eyes open, then smiled at her big. \"You're really pretty.\" Catherine laughed, \"And you're really drunk.\" Jackie leaned in for a kiss but Catherine pinned her against the wall, \"Jackie stop, it's too risky here.\" \"So violent,\" Jackie mumbled, before closing her eyes once more. \"Come on we need to get to the limo.\" When they got outside everyone was standing around, the limo wasn't there yet. Catherine led Jackie to a bench and put her arm around her to keep her from falling over. Rachel found them right as the limo pulled up, Jackie was knocked out cold. \"Can you help me with her?\" she asked. Catherine got into the limo first and reached for Jackie as Rachel kept her steady. \"Watch her head,\" she warned. Jackie's eyes were struggling to stay open as she stumbled into the limo. As soon as she sat down, she linked her arm through Catherine's and held her hand before dropping her head down on Catherine's shoulder. Within seconds her body went limp as she passed out. When the limo began its way back to the hotel, Catherine glanced around at everyone. They were all passed out or to that point, so she leaned down and kissed the top of Jackie's head before resting her own on top. The cool wind was blowing through her hair from the cracked window. The sky was beginning to lighten, a hint of the sunrise starting to peak through. Catherine hadn't experienced something like this since college, and couldn't remember the last time she felt this alive. She looked down at the girl resting on her arm, the girl who had completely changed her life, and smiled. When they reached the hotel she tried to shake Jackie to wake her. After much convincing, she finally got her to her feet and wrapped her arms around her shoulders. One of the security guards helped Catherine get her up to the room, \"I've got it from here, thanks\" she said as she opened the door and led Jackie to the bed. Jackie immediately curled into a ball so Catherine went and got changed. When she came back she rolled Jackie over and unzipped her dress. She wrestled her arms through it then began tugging at the bottom until it was off. Reaching into Jackie's luggage she found her lacrosse shirt and smiled. \"Jackie, can you sit up for me real quick so we can get you dressed?\" Jackie slowly lifted herself up, not even attempting to open her eyes. After Catherine slid the shirt over her head she opened her eyes and began to gag. \"Oh no, come on\" she said, hurrying Jackie to the bathtroom. She grabbed her hair and held it back as Jackie got sick. After some time had passed, Jackie leaned back and collapsed on the floor. Her mascara was running down her face as she moaned in pain. Catherine filled a glass with water and grabbed a towel. \"Here drink this, all of it.\" \"I can't\" she groaned. Catherine got on the floor next to her and wiped the mascara from her eyes. \"I'm sorry\" Jackie whimpered. \"What are you sorry for?\" \"Drunk,\" was all she said, sounding like a caveman. \"You're a 23 year old Hollywood actress, it could be a lot worse,\" Catherine laughed. Jackie quickly got up on her knees and got sick again. Catherine held her hair as she rubbed her back. \"I'm so sorry\" Jackie repeated, this time crying. \"Shhh, stop apologizing.\" She leaned back again and Catherine took her face in her hands. \"You have nothing to feel sorry about so stop punishing yourself. Do you not think this is what I did when I was your age? The only difference is I wasn't vomiting in a 5 star hotel toilet or getting drunk off of top shelf liquor at a Hollywood party,\" she teased. Jackie smiled. \"I'm serious. You deserve to have fun and act your age for once.\" \"I love you\" Jackie said softly, and probably the most romantic way she's ever said it, except for the fact that she proceeded to vomit seconds after. Catherine grabbed some pillows and blankets and decided it was best for them to camp out in the bathroom for the night. The next morning Catherine woke to muffled knocks on the door. It took her a minute to stand, her body stiff from sleeping on the hard bathroom floor. She looked through the peep hole and saw Rachel. \"Good Morning, how are you feeling?\" \"Miserable, where's Jackie?\" Catherine pointed to the bathroom, \"you probably don't want to go in there.\" Rachel made her way to the bathroom, holding her hand over her nose. \"She slept here all night?\" \"Yep.\" \"And you did too?\" She asked, noticing all of the pillows. \"Yeah, she was in rough shape.\" \"Screw teaching, come help me be Jackie's assistant. You can handle all the dirty work,\" she teased. \"I need to get out of here, I can't handle this smell anymore. Can you have her call me when she's awake? There's a few things I need to go over with her before I leave.\" \"Yeah no problem.\" \"There's coffee and pastries down the hall for you all, feel free to help yourself. I'm sure Jackie could use it.\" \"Good idea.\" Catherine followed Rachel out to grab some breakfast. When she returned she made her way into the bathroom. The smell made her gag, it was much worse after getting some fresher air. She knelt down and brushed the hair from Jackie's eyes, causing her to slowly wake. She gradually got up and looked around confused. \"Why did I sleep in the bathroom?\" \"We slept in the bathroom because the toilet was your best friend all night,\" Catherine smiled. \"Oh no. I'm afraid to ask how I behaved,\" she said, ashamed. \"You were actually on your best behavior, well as best as an intoxicated person can be. You just had yourself a lot of fun\" she laughed. \"You slept here too?\" \"Yep.\" \"Well aren't you girlfriend of the year.\" She handed Jackie a water, \"there's some coffee and toast in the room, mind if I kick you out of your bed so I can take a shower? Rachel stopped by, she needs to talk to you before she leaves.\" After they both showered and began packing, Jackie called Rachel letting her know she could stop by. Within a few minutes she was at the door. \"Hey what's up?\" Jackie asked. \"Just a few things before we part ways.\" After going over Jackie's schedule for the week, she got up to leave but paused with her hand on the door handle, \"one more thing\" she said, looking back. \"Yeah?\" Jackie asked. \"Are you ever planing on telling me that you and Catherine are sleeping together?\" Catherine was packing her suitcase with her back to them, when she heard the words escape from Rachel's mouth. She froze in place, drawing in one final breath as her entire body went numb.[Chapter 22] Judging by the silence, Catherine knew Jackie was equally paralyzed. \"Holy shit, I was right?!\" Rachel gasped, breaking the silence. \"N-No it's not-it's not what you think,\" Jackie stuttered. Catherine pulled herself together and turned around, it wasn't fair to make Jackie deal with this on her own. \"It's okay Jackie.\" Jackie looked back at her with hesitation in her eyes. \"Rachel can you sit down?\" Catherine asked, trying to remain calm. Rachel looked like someone had just dropped a bomb on her, probably because they just did. She made her way across the room, switching her gaze between the two of them before slowly sitting down on the bed. \"Please keep this between the three of us for now, we're still trying to figure this whole thing out,\" Catherine pled. \"So there's no boyfriend?\" Was all Rachel could ask. \"How did you know?\" Jackie interrupted. \"I saw you two at dinner the other night. Underneath the table,\" she emphasized. Jackie shot Catherine a look and smirked, \"the irony that it was you to get us caught.\" \"Then I was in the bathroom at the party last night, right before we left, and overheard some questionable things.\" Catherine returned Jackie's snarky comment, \"That was all you sweetheart.\" \"Does anyone else know, or speculate?\" Catherine asked. \"No, not that I'm aware of. Everyone thinks Jackie has a boyfriend back in... Ohhh, Indiana.\" The expression on her face let them know she was slowly piecing it all together. \"So when you were venting to me the other day about your boyfriend... Oops. So I was talking to Catherine about... Catherine.\" Jackie's eyes grew big as she looked at Rachel. She couldn't believe she told Catherine about her struggles with their relationship. \"Rachel, that was supposed to be between me and you as friends. I was confiding in you.\" \"Well I thought Catherine was your best friend, and she knew your 'boyfriend'\" she said, using air quotes. \"It's fine Jackie. It actually helped that she told me, but we don't need to discuss this right now, we have more important things to deal with.\" Rachel sat on the side of the bed staring into space, her mind was obviously spinning a million miles a minute. \"How did this even happen? When did you guys start, I mean-\" Jackie interrupted her once more, \"We met my first week of college and it started almost immediately.\" \"Holy shit!\" Rachel raised her hands to her mouth, \"she's your ex too?! The one you were so tore up about all year?\" \" Yes. \" Jackie said through clenched teeth. She was not enjoying how exposed this was all leaving her. \"Damn Catherine, you did quite a number on her.\" \"Can we not talk about everything I've confided in you for the past year?\" Jackie said irritably. \"She's my girlfriend and you're my best friend. You need to grasp this concept because it's not fair to me to have my feelings be completely transparent between the two of you.\" \"Okay, I'm sorry you're right. This is really big news though so you're going to have to bear with me while I let it all sink in.\" \"I know, I'm sorry, you're right too.\" After a long pause Rachel began to smile, \"Aw, you guys have such a cute-and crazy, story.\" Jackie glanced at Catherine and smiled, it was weird letting someone into their secret little world. \"Jesus, no wonder you've been such a bitch to Tommy, Catherine.\" Catherine smiled at her, \"it's been rather difficult.\" \"Everything makes so much sense now,\" Rachel looked as though she had just discovered the meaning of life. \"Rachel you need to keep quiet about this for now. Please promise us that we can trust you. Wade and Matt are literally the only other people that know.\" Jackie said. \"Of course. Wow. This is really going to change a lot for you Jackie.\" \"Trust me, I'm well aware of that. And it's going to change a lot for Catherine too, so we really need to keep it private until we work it all out.\" \"I promise. I won't say a word to anyone\" Rachel said, placing her hand over her heart. She looked down at her phone, \"I'm sorry but I really need to get out of here, I have a flight to catch.\" She got up and hugged Jackie, \"thanks for confiding in me, it means a lot\" she whispered. \"And you Catherine, it's nice to meet the real you,\" she said as she hugged her as well. \"I've heard so many good things about you and I can see why Jackie is so in love with you. Whoops, sorry Jackie,\" she said looking back. \"It's okay,\" Jackie laughed. \"She's very familiar with my feelings for her.\" \"Thanks so much for everything, it was really nice meeting you as well. I'm sure I'll be seeing you again soon,\" Catherine said as she hugged her tightly. Rachel looked back at them again before leaving, \"you guys are adorable.\" As soon as the door closed Jackie and Catherine both looked at each other and let out a deep sigh, one they had both been holding in since Rachel spoke. \"Way to go Stark! Warning me to behave when your behavior is what got us caught.\" Jackie said, poking Catherine in the shoulder. \"Excuse me but you're guilty too.\" \"I need to sit down,\" Jackie sighed, suddenly feeling light headed. Catherine sat down next to her on the bed, \"are you okay?\" She asked, rubbing her back. \"Yeah, I just can't believe this is all finally happening. I mean I know it's just Rachel but it's such a relief. I no longer need to hide from the people closest to me, except for Sean.\" \"You can tell him too if you want.\" \"Really? You wouldn't mind?\" Jackie asked. She couldn't believe that Catherine was starting to come around to the idea of coming out of hiding, so to speak. \"No. I like Sean, and if I were him I'd feel pretty crappy being the only one left in the dark. Not Tommy though. I do not trust that little asshole.\" \"No way. He's too hungry for the press right now.\" Jackie fell back onto the bed and stared up at the ceiling. Her mind was racing, probably as much as Rachel's was. Catherine laid down next to her, propping herself up on her side with her elbow. \"Are you sure you're okay Porcupine?\" \"Yeah, it's just a crazy feeling. The little bubble we've been living in just popped.\" Catherine reached over and caressed Jackie's cheek with the back of her finger as she smiled at her sweetly. \"Now I have to share you with the rest of the world,\" Jackie flashed a pout as she grabbed Catherine's hand from her cheek and intertwined their fingers. She felt her eyes begin to burn and stared at their hands for a moment, realizing everything they've ever known was about to change. When she finally looked up at Catherine, she noticed her eyes were glistening as well. Jackie leaned over and gently wiped away a tear that had suddenly escaped Catherine's eye. They both burst into laughter about how ridiculous they were being. \"This is stupid, we're still us.\" Jackie said. \"Yes we are. And we better get going,\" Catherine interrupted, tucking Jackie's hair behind her ear. She rolled over and stood up off of the bed before pulling on Jackie's arms to help her sit up. Once she was sitting, Catherine took her face in her hands and gently kissed her forehead. \"Are you ready for all of this, kiddo?\" Jackie looked up at her with a smile expanding from ear to ear, \"absolutely.\"[Chapter 23] Jackie opted for sunglasses and a sweatshirt, given her current hungover condition. No one seemed to notice who she was until she felt a gentle tug on her pants when they were in line for security. When she looked down, she saw a little girl. \"Excuse me, are you Tyler?\" She asked softly. Jackie smiled and crouched down next to her. \"Hi cutie! Can you keep a secret?\" \"Yes.\" The little girl eagerly responded. \"I am Tyler, but shhh!\" She said, placing her finger over her lips. \"Don't tell anyone okay? I'm on a very important secret mission.\" Catherine watched as the little girls face lit up with joy. \"I promise I won't tell anyone Tyler!\" \"Pinky promise?\" Jackie asked, sticking her pinky out. \"Pinky promise!\" The little girl excitedly said, looping her finger through Jackie's. \"Is there any chance I can take your picture with her?\" The mother asked. \"I'll be discrete.\" \"Of course!\" After posing for the picture, Jackie autographed a piece of paper for them. \"What's your name sweetheart?\" \"Emma.\" \"You have a beautiful name, Emma. This is Catherine\" Jackie said, pointing to her as she continued writing. \"She's my best friend in the entire universe.\" \"Hi Catherine,\" Emma said, sticking her tiny hand out. \"Hi Emma, you sure are pretty\" Catherine smiled, her heart melting at both the little girl and Jackie including her. Emma flashed her a bashful smile, \"thank you.\" \"Well it sure was nice meeting you, Emma!\" Jackie said, as she gave her a big hug. \"I promise I won't say anything Tyler!\" She whispered. \"How about this. You can tell whoever you want, just as long as you wait until you get home. Okay, sweetie?\" \"Okay!\" She said, obviously over the moon that she'd be able to tell all of her friends back home. \"Thank you so much! You're so sweet!\" Her mom said graciously. \"It was my pleasure,\" Jackie winked, before they were separated. \"Well that was adorable.\" Catherine beamed. \"I know right? What a cutie. The smallest fans are my favorite.\" The flight from New York to California was a grueling five hours. Catherine let Jackie have the window seat, both because Jackie wanted to sleep off her hangover, and mostly because Catherine was still uneasy with actually getting herself to look out the window. Baby steps. Jackie passed out soon after take off as Catherine worked on preparing herself for her interviews. After her eyes grew heavy and the words started to blur on the paper, she looped her arm through Jackie's and rested her head on her shoulder. About an hour later they both woke to the noise of the flight attendant pushing the drink cart. Jackie opened her eyes and noticed the compromising position they were in. She slid her arm out from Catherine's, \"I'm sorry, it must've been out of habit.\" \"No it's okay, it was me.\" Jackie looked at her questionably, \"this is okay with you?\" \"As long as they don't figure out my name and put two and two together right? And what are the chances they'd find out things that happened in small town Bloomington.\" Before Jackie could answer, the plane began to shake then it suddenly dipped down. Catherine nervously grabbed her hand. Jackie pushed open the window, \"it's just turbulence, looks like we're heading into a storm.\" \"Can you close that please\" Catherine asked, as she laid her head back and closed her eyes, squeezing Jackie's hand hard. \"It's okay, it's completely normal. I promise.\" The plane dipped again and Jackie felt Catherine's body tense up against hers. She leaned in closer, putting her other arm on Catherine's to offer a little more support. \"It's okay, I swear.\" Catherine didn't say anything, her breathing was incredibly fast and she was squeezing her eyes closed hard. \"What can I do?\" Jackie asked. \"I'm okay,\" Catherine said, trying to breathe slowly. \"You don't always need to act so strong,\" Jackie said smiling. \"Come here\" she said, as she lifted the arm rest and offered her her arm. Catherine lopped her arm through Jackie's, clinging on tightly as she squeezed her hand with the other. As the plane dropped again she buried her face into Jackie's shoulder. Jackie lifted her hand and kissed it slowly. Although she'd never tell her, Jackie loved when Catherine was vulnerable like this. It wasn't often that she was able to be the stronger one in their relationship, and she loved the feeling of providing some security to her as well. \"Are you nervous for your interviews?\" She thought maybe getting her mind off of the plane might help with her anxiety. \"Yes.\" \"You're going to do great, you're the most confident person I know. I mean you kissed me in the middle of campus during a department mixer, in broad daylight, not knowing how I'd react. You've got some balls woman.\" \"You wanted me.\" Catherine replied without even pausing, her face still buried in Jackie's shoulder. Jackie laughed, \"You know, one of the things that made me fall in love with you is your humbleness.\" Catherine pinched her arm. \"Ow! And how gentle you always are towards me. But sometimes I wish you'd be a little more aggressive, I'm not made of glass you know.\" Jackie said sarcastically. This time Catherine couldn't help but laugh. She lifted her face up and smiled big at Jackie. \"I know what you're doing.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Jackie replied, playing dumb. \"Who's the psychology professor here?\" \"You are, Professor Stark,\" Jackie winked. Catherine squeezed her knee, \"thank you though.\" \"So we've got two more hours left on this flight, and were not going to see each other for a while after Thursday. Might as well make the most of it, plane turbulence and all,\" Jackie joked. Catherine started to ease up a little, \"is all of the Neptune stuff over after Europe?\" \"Yeah. Well, the execs are throwing a big party once we get back, one last hurrah.\" \"Are you sad that it's all over?\" \"Yes and no. It's surreal to think I'll be unemployed after this, but I'm exhausted and happy to get away from all of the Tommy drama.\" Jackie saw Catherine pause for a minute, she hoped she wasn't worrying about her and Tommy being in Europe together. \"Why didn't you ever mention that you wanted to go back to school?\" Catherine asked. Not what Jackie was expecting. \"I assumed you knew. Just because Neptune came along didn't mean I ever planned on stopping my education.\" \"Where are you going to go?\" \"Well, I think that all depends on where you land a job now. I don't want to interfere.\" \"What if you land that big movie?\" Jackie just stared at her. Given their current situation, it made things a little awkward. \"What?\" Catherine asked confused. \"You've cut off the circulation to my arm, I don't think you'll be getting on a flight half way across the world anytime soon.\"Catherine let go of her arm. She wasn't sure if it was due to the circulation comment or if she was upset. \"You're not turning that down because of me.\" \"Well you're not the boss of me,\" Jackie replied, pretending to be tough. Catherine just smiled. \"We'll figure it out when the time comes. By the way, Matt and Wade really want to set up a meeting with us and PR before we put ourselves out there too much. I know you've got enough on your plate right now, so we'll figure out a time when I get back from Europe.\" \"What exactly is this meeting going to entail?\" \"Just getting everything in order in case anything leaks out. Damage control is the official lingo.\" \"Such official business for a relationship\" Catherine responded, seeming somewhat bothered with the entire thing. \"Welcome to Hollywood,\" Jackie said, rolling her eyes. \"So what about you, what's the best case scenario for these job interviews. Which is your first choice?\" \"My first choice will always be Stanford since it's my alma mater, but they haven't reached out to me.\" Jackie knew Catherine was upset about Stanford but it was so far from Los Angeles that it made her worry a bit. Regardless, she needed to stay supportive. \"You never know, they still might. What about second choice?\" \"Second choice is UCLA. They have the number six psychology department in the country.\" \"You know what else they have?\" Jackie asked. \"What?\" \"Me, minutes away,\" she grinned. Catherine laughed, \"yes, that too.\" \"So Berkley is your last choice?\" \"Yeah, it's still a really good department though. They rank in at number 10. But we'd have to deal with some distance issues,\" Catherine said. \"Give or take six hours.\" Jackie smirked. She had already looked it up as soon as Catherine landed the interview. She knew she couldn't be selfish enough to complain though, Catherine was already moving across the country. \"We'll figure it out when the time comes,\" Catherine smiled, mirroring Jackie's response to her pending movie predicament. They talked the rest of the flight, just enjoying each other's company since it had become quite rare for them to have five hours alone just to talk.[Chapter 24] By the time they landed and checked into their hotel, Jackie and Catherine were both exhausted from the late night and long day of traveling. Not even having enough energy to get dinner, they collapsed on the bed and ordered in room service. \"I feel awful, I'm so tired!\" Jackie whimpered, as she fell backwards on the bed. \"So am I, and sore. That bathroom floor did a number on me\" Catherine said, rubbing her aching neck. \"I'm sorry,\" Jackie apologized guiltily, \"I can give you a massage?\" \"Actually I think I'm going to go take a long, hot, bath\" Catherine replied, before kissing Jackie on the cheek and rolling out of bed. Before she closed the bathroom door she turned back to Jackie, \"you can join if you want\" she said with a wink. She was in the bath almost ten minutes before she came to the realization that Jackie wasn't coming. Knowing her, she had probably fallen asleep. When Catherine's muscles finally felt relaxed and her body was at ease, she came back into the bedroom. The sight of Jackie made her laugh, confirming her assumption; she was curled up, in a ball, and fast asleep. The next morning Catherine rolled over and smiled at the sight of Jackie in bed next to her. This was all becoming too normal, it was going to break her heart having to go back home in a couple of days. Jackie was leaving for Europe next week for the final leg of her Neptune 26 tour, so it would be a good three weeks before they were able to see each other again. They haven't had to deal with that much time apart since they'd reunited. Figuring Jackie would sleep a little longer, Catherine decided to get a work out in. After all of the food and alcohol they had consumed this weekend, she definitely needed it. She rolled over and whispered in Jackie's ear, \"I'm going to go for a run, I'll be back soon\" then kissed her on the cheek. Jackie grabbed her wrist as she tried rolling back, \"noooo, don't go yet\" she said half consciously, as she turned over to face her. \"Stay with me for a little while.\" Catherine smiled and rolled back over as Jackie nestled in next to her. \"No wake up call is the best way to start a day\" she murmured, as she slowly opened her eyes and stretched. \"Is it?\" Catherine smirked, insinuating there was something better. \"Okay, waking up next to you is the best way to start a day,\" Jackie said, fixing her statement. \"Better,\" Catherine smiled. \"Crap\" Jackie blurted out, as the expression on her face revealed she was starting to remember something. \"I fell asleep on you last night didn't I? The bath.\" \"You did. I almost got hypothermia waiting for you in there so long,\" Catherine responded stone faced. \"Shut up,\" she said slapping her arm, \"I owe you though.\" \"Yes you do. Come on, let's go run.\" \"Noooooo\" Jackie groaned. \"You don't want to spend time with me?\" Jackie flashed her an annoyed look so Catherine climbed on top of her and straddled her. \"You're not going to see me for three...long...weeks,\" she said kissing her neck with each word. Jackie put her hands on her but Catherine grabbed them and pinned her down. \"Nuh uh, not until after we run,\" she teased. \"Do you always get what you want?\" \"Always,\" Catherine grinned. Fifteen minutes later they were outside the hotel lobby stretching, despite Jackie's displeasure. \"So where to?\" Asked Jackie. \"We're near campus so I'm eager to take a look since we won't have much time before our flight tomorrow.\" \"Sounds good.\" As they were running through campus, Catherine was busy absorbing it all in as Jackie struggled to keep up. She hadn't ran in almost two weeks and the after party had really done a number on her. She was relieved when Catherine stopped to ask directions to the psychology building. \"Need a breather?\" Catherine asked, as Jackie was slumped over, trying to catch her breath, \"Yes please.\" After walking for a few minutes, Catherine stopped and looked up, \"here it is.\" \"Professor Stark?\" A voice said from behind them. \"Yes?\" Catherine turned around. \"I thought that was you. Hi, I'm Professor Richardson. We spoke on the phone, I will be interviewing you tomorrow.\" \"Oh hello! It's a pleasure meeting you. Please ignore my appearance, we were just out for a run and decided to take a look around campus,\" Catherine said, obviously mortified. \"Don't be silly, I'm glad to see you taking an interest in the University. How are you liking the area so far?\" \"We actually just arrived last night, so this is our first time getting out. Pardon my manners, this is my friend Jackie,\" Catherine said pointing to her. \"Hi, it's nice to meet you,\" Jackie offered her hand. \"You as well. I won't keep you two any longer. I'm looking forward to our interview tomorrow Professor Stark.\" \"As am I, it was a pleasure meeting you Professor Richardson,\" she said as she shook his hand. Once he was out of sight, Catherine let out a groan, \"oh my God, how embarrassing.\" \"What? You were fine,\" Jackie responded. \"Seeing me in spandex, dripping sweat, isn't exactly the first impression I wanted to make.\" Jackie looked her down, \"speaking of, being on a college campus with you- why don't we go find an empty classroom for old times sake?\" She teased. \"Don't you dare\" Catherine warned, pointing a finger at her. \"I love a good dare\" Jackie responded playfully. \"I'm serious Jackie,\" she said sternly. \"I know, calm down I'm just kidding.\" \"Isn't it gorgeous here?\" Catherine said, changing the subject. \"Bloomington isn't even a blimp on the radar compared to this,\" she said in awe as her eyes skimmed the beautiful landscape. Jackie followed her eyes. The campus was gorgeous, it was a lot prettier to look at than Bloomington and a lot larger. Jackie couldn't help but think of how many different people Catherine would meet if she worked here. Suddenly her stomach began to tie in knots thinking about her being so far away, making a new life here without her. What if she found another student that struck her eye? What if she lost interest in Jackie now that she was a big time Professor at a top ten university? When she looked back at Catherine she saw the excitement on her face and felt guilty for being so paranoid. \"It is gorgeous, I'm sure you'd love it here.\" Back at the hotel Jackie sat on the bed as Catherine showered. She couldn't shake the doubts she'd been feeling since back at campus. Their life this past week had been so perfect being able to see each other every single day. She couldn't imagine a six hour drive being between them. When Catherine got out of the shower she opened the door and saw Jackie sitting on the edge of the bed with a gloomy look on her face. \"You okay Porcupine?\" Jackie jerked her head up, \"yeah\" she smiled, Catherine could tell it wasn't genuine. \"No you're not, what's up?\" She said as she sat down next to her. \"Nothing, I swear,\" she smiled. There it was again. \"Jackie I know you well enough to know something's wrong, and I know you well enough to know that's not your real smile.\" \"You know, it's really unfair dating a psychology professor,\" Jackie said giving her a side smile. \"It's not so much psychology as it is how well I know you,\" Catherine laughed, \"so tell me.\" \"It's nothing, I'm just having a jealous girlfriend moment and I have no right to be, considering my own career.\" \"I'm not following,\" Catherine asked confused, who was Jackie jealous about? \"I'm just feeling self conscious about this all. I'm scared you're going to get tired of me once you start your new exciting life. And the distance, what if you meet someone else who can give you something I can't.\" Catherine's chest tightened as she listened to Jackie. \"That's never going to happen,\" she said, placing her hand on her knee. \"You don't think I have these exact same insecurities?\" Jackie laughed, \"no, look at you.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"You're gorgeous Catherine. When you walk into a room you make both men and women turn their heads\" Jackie said as she stood up. \"And you're a young, gorgeous Hollywood actress!\" Catherine fired back. \"I'm sorry, I really am. Your interview is tomorrow and I'm being unfair talking about this\" Jackie said, growing quiet. After spending all weekend in Jackie's world, Catherine was a little irritated that she was acting like this after one quick stroll around campus. However annoyed she was, she couldn't be upset though. She knew exactly what Jackie was feeling, because she felt it every time Jackie stepped into her movie star role. \"Come here, sit down\" she said, taking her hands. \"No, just forget I said anything. I'm just tired and being moody. Can we rewind the last 60 seconds?\" \"Please sit,\" Catherine asked again. Jackie just stood there, \"No, I'm being stupid and I'm embarassing myself. Really, I'm okay. We're out of ice though so I'm going to go get some.\" Jackie let go of her hands and began to walk away before Catherine grabbed her arms and pulled her in front of her again. \"You're not being stupid. No one is ever going to be able to offer me something you can't. You're not replaceable.\" Jackie looked down and offered a small smile, Catherine hadn't seen her look so insecure since they had first met. \"You're my little Porcupine\" she said, moving her hands to Jackie's hips, playfully rocking them before drawing her closer. \"Come here...\" Jackie leaned down and Catherine brought her face closer, kissing her and pulling her down onto the bed. \"I'm sorry, I really am. You don't need this on your mind before your interview, I'm just scared that-\" Before Jackie could finish, Catherine kissed her again. She could tell Jackie was feeling extremely vulnerable, to be honest she was too. She really liked what she saw so far down here and knew the distance would be brutal on their relationship. Especially if Jackie wanted to go to school on top of continuing to act. Wanting to make them escape these feelings of insecurity, she did what she always did and buried her emotional pain with physical pleasure, bringing Jackie along for the ride.[Chapter 25] Jackie woke up the next day to Catherine pacing around the room, whispering to herself while reading off of a notebook. Her hair was in a towel so she had obviously been up for quite some time. Knowing how nervous she was and not wanting to to break her concentration, Jackie just laid there silently and watched. A few minutes, and several laps around the room later, Catherine's eyes finally caught hers and she stopped in place. \"How long have you been awake?\" \"A few minutes.\" \"I'm sorry, did I wake you?\" \"No, not at all. You were in the zone so I didn't want to interrupt.\" \"I'm so nervous. I haven't been to a job interview in so long. Hecht literally hired me straight out of college.\" \"Come sit,\" Jackie said, patting the bed. Catherine came over and Jackie placed her hand over Catherine's, \"You're going to do great. You've already met him, so that's half the battle right there. At least you'll be a little more comfortable now.\" \"That's true. I don't know how you do it. A big part of your occupation is basically being a professional interviewee,\" Catherine joked. Jackie smirked, \"pretty much. It gets easier though. You just have to do your best and not dwell on it. You lectured in front of full class rooms for years and gave your speech in front of a packed hall, you have nothing to be nervous about. You're the most confident person I know.\" Catherine leaned over and kissed her on the forehead, \"you're right, I shouldn't feel so out of my element.\" \"You're a damn good professor. Not many college courses have waiting lists. No matter how intimidating you were, students were still drawn to you.\" As soon as the words escaped her lips she knew that sounded wrong. \"Okay, bad example.\" \"Yeah, I'm trying to avoid that subject at all costs\" Catherine laughed, before glancing at the clock. \"We need to leave in about an hour so I'm going to start getting ready.\" By the time Jackie packed and got out of the shower, Catherine was dressed head to toe, wearing her lucky black suit. It seemed like just yesterday she had laid eyes on her from across the lobby at Stanford for the first time in a year, wearing that exact suit. These last few weeks had flown by but at the same time it felt like they had never spent any time apart. \"You look gorgeous\" Jackie beamed, as she walked over to Catherine. \"You've got this. You're Professor Fucking Stark!\" Catherine laughed at the remark and hugged her, \"I'm so glad you're here with me during my interviews to offer your mood lightening remarks.\" While Catherine was in her interview, Jackie took it upon herself to walk around campus. As she sat on a bench she watched as students passed by, socializing and enjoying each other's company between classes. She felt extremely nostalgic even though it had only been a year. She missed the normalcy college offered. She missed finally getting to experience going to school. She missed the friends she made and most importantly, she missed the way her and Catherine's relationship was back then. How easy it was regardless of the sneaking around. Who would have guessed a year later, they'd be out here in California trying to figure out how to make it work. In the middle of her daydream her phone started to ring, it was Catherine letting her know the interview was over. \"So tell me everything\" Jackie said, once they met back at the car. \"It went really well I think,\" Catherine smiled. \"He was really impressed with my article and watched my speech online and loved it, so I guess we will wait and see.\" \"That's great! See I told you, you had nothing to worry about\" Jackie grinned, playfully slapping Catherine's knee. \"So do you want to get some lunch around here to celebrate? I looked up some local favorites online as I was waiting.\" \"No, let's just get a bite to eat at the airport.\" \"Are you sure? We have plenty of time.\" \"Yeah, it's fine.\" Jackie wasn't sure why Catherine was so eager to get to the airport. They literally hadn't left the hotel room except for their run yesterday. She hoped it wasn't because of her, she didn't want to ruin this opportunity for her. \"Is this because of my little meltdown yesterday? I promise I'm fine. I'm sincerely excited for you, I even walked around campus today.\" \"No, not at all. I just don't want to get my hopes up and fall in love with this place if it doesn't work out.\" \"Okay, airport it is then\" Jackie replied as she pulled away from campus. The next two days flew by. As expected, Catherine's interview at UCLA went equally as well as the one at UC Berkeley, and she loved the campus even more than the last. Jackie was thrilled she loved it considering the proximity it was to her. With all of the interviews and travel, they weren't left with much time to just spend with one another. Before they knew it, it was their last night together and time seemed to be quickly slipping away from them. They hadn't talked much about their pending three week separation. Mostly because neither of them wanted to think about it, yet alone let it ruin their limited time together, but it was definitely heavy on their minds. Catherine decided to cook a nice dinner for them since nutrition was something Jackie was definitely lacking in her life. After her interview they took a trip to the local farmers market and Catherine gave Jackie a crash course in healthy eating before returning back to Jackie's. \"I'm well aware of how to eat healthy, I just don't have the time\" she said, trying to pull any excuse she could think of as they were carrying the groceries back up to her apartment. Catherine just shot her a look, \"that's a textbook excuse you know.\" \"Be honest. Do you think I'm fat?\" Jackie pouted as she paused before going in the door, only being half serious. \"Totally\" Catherine teased, poking her in the stomach as she passed. \"It's not about weight, it's about health. You're going to get sick with all of this traveling you do if you don't get your immune system in check, and I doubt you want to be sick in Europe.\" Jackie swallowed hard at the word. It's the first time either of them had spoken of it in days. \"Let's make this interesting while we cook\" she said, changing the subject. \"I'm afraid to ask,\" Catherine said wearily. Jackie went to the cabinet and pulled down two wine glasses before grabbing a bottle from the counter. \"It's called Never Have I Ever.\" \"Okay, how do you play?\" Catherine asked as she unloaded the groceries. \"It's easy. When it's your turn you just say something you've never done before and if the other person has, they take a drink.\" \"Are you just trying to get out of cooking?\" \"Maybe,\" Jackie grinned. \"Fine. I'll start\" Catherine said. \"Never have I ever lived off of take out food.\" Jackie laughed and took a giant sip, \"I figured I'd better drink a lot on that one considering it's all I live off of.\" She made her way over to the counter to start helping Catherine. \"So how did you learn to cook anyway?\" \"When my parent's died we lived with my grandma before she passed away. She taught me what she could but then when she got sick it became my responsibility, so I began teaching myself and took a couple of classes.\" Jackie looked up at Catherine but her eyes never left the cutting board as she chopped. It pained Jackie thinking how hard it must have been on her to lose her family at such a young age, no wonder she was so tough. Mark's death was enough to rattle her own world so she couldn't imagine losing her entire family. \"Where did you guy's go after your grandma died?\" \"I had just turned 18 so I moved back into my parent's house, the house I live in now, and my brother lived with me for a little while before joining the army. Then once he left I came out here to Stanford then back home for grad school, and you know the rest.\" Jackie placed her hand on Catherine's shoulder sympathetically. Catherine looked up and smiled, \"it's okay. It was a long time ago.\" She could see the pain behind her eyes and knew just because it had been there for quite a while, it was still painful no matter how hard she tried to hide it. After a short pause Catherine said, \"It's your turn.\" \"What?\" Jackie asked confused. \"The game.\" \"Oh, right. Hm… let me think. Let's make this interesting,\" Jackie wanted to change the mood and lighten things up. \"Never have I ever… slept with someone younger than me.\" Catherine rolled her eyes at her as she reached for her glass of wine, \"real original.\" \"Oh wait! Never mind, I lied\" Jackie said, grabbing Catherine's glass before it reached her lips. \"I forgot about Zach. He was slightly younger.\" \"You slept with Zach?\" Catherine said with quite a bit of shock in her face. Apparently Jackie failed to mention that piece of information. \"Yeah, not my proudest moment.\" \"When?\" \"Right after we broke up, so give me a break.\" \"Were you drunk?\" Catherine was firing off questions faster than Jackie could answer. \"Unfortunately no. As soon as he fell asleep I tried to sneak out and he caught me, I felt terrible.\" Catherine stared at Jackie with a disgusted face. \"Oh like you can judge.\" \"Where?\" \"Where what?\" \"Where did this happen?\" \"His dorm.\" Jackie knew Catherine was a tiny bit on the possessive side, but was somewhat shocked at her sudden jealously over innocent little Zach. She was actually enjoying it. Catherine started laughing, \"that's cute.\" \"What can I say? How could I leave college without having a one night stand in a dorm room?\" \"What, having sex all over campus wasn't enough for you? You just had to get that one stereotypical experience in to end with a bang? Pun intended.\" \"Am I sensing a bit of jealousy? I did end it with a bang, but it wasn't him. As I recall I ran into a certain someone in the library my last day, someone who drug me back to their house.\" \"Drug? Please. You were more than willing. I believe you literally tackled me.\" Jackie laughed, \"guilty.\" \"And jealous of Zach? Please. I would break that boy.\" \"Ew, I don't even want to picture that\" Jackie said, shaking the image from her mind. \"Hence my disgust.\" \"Yes, because it was such a joy watching you take that man upstairs.\" Catherine looked at her, annoyed that she was bringing this up again but they were interrupted when Jackie's phone began ringing. When she pulled it out of her pocket she saw it was Wade. \"Hey Wade, how's it going,\" Jackie held her finger up to Catherine to excuse herself. \"Hey Jackie, its going good but even better for you. I just received a phone call from the casting director of that movie trilogy you auditioned for. You got a call back!\" \"Really? That's great. When?\" Jackie looked back at Catherine who was busy over the stove and slipped back into her bedroom. \"I told them you're headed to Europe so they would like to squeeze you in before you leave.\" \"I don't know if that's possible Wade, I leave on Monday.\" \"Okay, well let me give them a call back and see if there's anytime this weekend that would work for them.\" \"Okay, sounds good.\" \"Alright well congratulations Jackie! Stop by my office sometime tomorrow to pick up the script.\" \"Thanks Wade, I'll see you then.\" Jackie sat down on her bed for a minute to collect her thoughts. As vain as it sounded, she wasn't completely shocked that she got a call back after the praise she received after her first audition. Thinking back to that day, how upset she was. It was the first time her and Catherine had to say goodbye since reconnecting, and now here they were again. Funny that the same audition went hand in hand with each difficult goodbye. Catherine looked back when she hadn't heard Jackie in a while and noticed she had disappeared. She wondered what type of news Wade had for her, probably something to do with that big movie considering Jackie left the room. She reached over and poured herself another glass of wine before continuing with dinner. \"Smells greats,\" Jackie said from behind her as she came back into the kitchen. \"Thanks, it's almost finished if you want to grab some plates. Catherine waited for Jackie to say something about the call but she didn't, which was causing a bit of awkwardness. Finally when they sat down Jackie took a sip of wine and said, \"so that was Wade letting me know I got a call back for that movie.\" \"That's great! Why didn't you say something sooner?\" \"It's just a tough topic and I don't want to put a damper on the night.\" \"Never would I ever not be supportive of your career\" Catherine smiled. Jackie's expression turned solemn before grabbing her wine glass and taking a drink. Catherine just looked back at her confused. \"I don't deserve not to drink. Not after the way I acted at Berkeley, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I want you to get the job at UCLA. I need to work on my selfishness apparently.\" After she finished drinking her glass she grabbed the bottle and stood, \"we need more wine.\" Catherine grabbed her own glass and followed her into the kitchen. \"It's not selfish. I'd be worried if you wanted me to be far away from you. Here pour me a glass then too, because of course I'd rather you not go to Europe\" she said, placing her glass on the counter. Jackie filled both of their glasses then hopped up on the counter. \"Cheers to two selfish assholes trying to make it work.\" Catherine laughed and clinked her glass with Jackie's. \"If it comes down to it, we will still see each other every weekend. We will take turns driving to each other. Hey at least it'll keep things fresh, we won't get sick of each other.\" \"Never have I ever thought in a million years that I'd fall in love with a college professor in Bloomington, Indiana\" Jackie smiled. \"Never have I ever thought in a million years I'd fall in love,\" Catherine replied. Jackie drank, \"you never thought you'd fall in love?\" \"No. Why do you think I slept with students? They were guaranteed failed relationships that could never work.\" \"Why did you do that to yourself?\" \"When you're use to being on your own for so long, you just get use to the emptiness. You're too afraid to fill it in fear that you'll have to experience that kind of pain all over again when you lose them.\" \"I didn't mean to leave you. I promise you if I knew how you felt I would've fought harder\" Jackie said, taking Catherine's hands in her own. \"I know. It was my fault. I was too scared to admit that I had lost control.\" \"Well now you're shit out of luck because you're stuck with me, and I'm in control now,\" Jackie said with a tough look on her face. \"You wish,\" Catherine laughed. \"I think it's safe to say it's an equal playing ground for once.\" Before they knew it, they had stayed up all night talking and it was almost time for them to head to the airport. \"I can't believe we've been up all night, at least I'll be exhausted enough to sleep through the flight home.\" \"Me either, even though we took advantage of every second of last night, it still feels like we got sucked through a time-continuum vortex. This all went too fast.\" \"Time-continuum vortex?\" Catherine repeated, raising her eyebrow. \"Is this another Neptune pick up line? I'm flattered, but I don't think we have enough time.\" \"Shut up,\" Jackie laughed, \"you know what I mean.\" \"I do. It doesn't feel real to me yet. I think we might have spoiled ourselves being together so much. I might have to break the rules and let Ethan sleep with me to make up for it.\" \"No fair, I don't have anything to help me with the loneliness. I miss Ethan.\" Jackie frowned. \"You're going to be in Europe, I have zero sympathy for you,\" Catherine joked as she poked her in the chest. Jackie laughed but her eyes shifted focus to the floor as pain suddenly began ripping through her chest. She didn't want to go to Europe, let alone for ten days. That was a lot of time to be away from home, and away from Catherine. \"Are you sure I can't convince you to come?\" \"You know I'd love to but I need to get back to Ethan, the poor thing has been getting quite neglected lately. The time is going to fly by, they're going to keep you busy and it's your last trip for Neptune so I'm sure everyone's going to let loose. You'll have a blast.\" \"You sound like a mom trying to convince her child how great summer camp is going to be,\" Jackie replied. Catherine laughed at the reference but stopped as soon as Jackie looked up at her with tears in her eyes. \"Porcupine! Don't start this!\" Catherine frowned as she took Jackie in her arms. \"My heart can't handle a sad goodbye.\" \"I can't help it,\" Jackie laughed as the tears escaped her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. Catherine pulled back and took her face in her hands, gently wiping away the tears with her thumbs. \"You know I'm just a phone call away whenever you need me.\" \"You know there's a nine hour time difference, right?\" Jackie asked. \"I guess that slipped my mind. We'll make it work, I'll stay up late. Whatever it takes. I love you, you know that?\" Jackie slowly nodded with her head buried in Catherine's shoulder. They both stood there, clinging to one another tightly for a few minutes before they had to leave. Jackie let out a long breath trying to pull herself together, she couldn't believe how hard she was taking this. \"I'm sorry, I don't think the exhaustion is helping. No more tears, I promise.\" Since last time was such a fiasco they decided Jackie would just drop Catherine off instead. When they reached the passenger drop off, Jackie got out of the car to help Catherine with her luggage. \"We've got this. I'll see you in a few weeks, okay?\" Catherine said, before giving her one final hug. Jackie slowly let go of Catherine's hand, letting her fingers slip through as she started to walk away. She stood there by her car and waved as Catherine walked towards the door but suddenly Catherine came back and hugged her one last time, dropping her bag and taking Jackie's face in her hands, kissing her right there on the curb. Catherine disappeared into the terminal before Jackie could even think, leaving her stunned on the street. \"Ma'am, I'm sorry but you're going to need to move your vehicle now\" a voice said in front of her, bringing Jackie back to reality. As she drove away from the airport a big smile expanded across her face; simultaneously inside the airport, Catherine was wearing the same grin as she checked in for her flight.[Chapter 26] Jackie woke up in a haze. The darkness of her room was playing tricks with her mind, the way it does when you've slept so long you don't know whether it's morning or night. The last thing she remembered was collapsing onto her bed after returning from Wade's office. She reached over and felt for her phone on the nightstand. It was 1 A.M., she had literally slept all day. Panicking, she checked her phone and saw a missed call and messages from Catherine. Thankfully she had assumed correctly, that Jackie had fallen asleep. Catherine was three hours ahead of her so she would hopefully be awake in the next few hours. She wrote her a text apologizing and asking her to call when she woke up. Slowly getting out of bed, she walked across the room and turned on the light. The sudden brightness was too harsh on her eyes, causing her to squint until they adjusted. When she could finally see clearly, she noticed the emptiness in her room now that all of Catherine's things were no longer there. It was finally starting to sink in that she was really gone. Yearning to talk to her even more, Jackie made her way into the living room to start memorizing the script she had picked up from Wade. Hopefully this would keep her mind occupied until Catherine awoke. Catherine slowly opened her eyes and glanced around at her surroundings. It felt strange waking up in her bed for the first time in a week, and even stranger being alone. She rolled over and placed her hand on the empty spot next to her. It's funny how she had slept alone for so long but now it suddenly felt unnatural. She missed waking up seeing Jackie in the vacant spot, curled up in a ball. Once she gained complete consciousness she retrieved her phone and saw the message from Jackie. It was 8 A.M. which meant it was only 5 A.M. in California, so she opted to first send a text in case Jackie had fallen back asleep. \"Good Morning Porcupine, are you awake?\" Seconds later Jackie called her. \"I'll take that as a yes?\" Catherine laughed. \"Thank God, I've been waiting for you to wake up!\" \"Had a long night I assume?\" \"Excruciatingly long. I woke up at 1 A.M., I fell asleep sometime around 1 P.M. mind you. I'm so sorry I slept through your call.\" \"It's okay. I figured you had fallen asleep, I called it an early night too.\" \"My apartment is depressingly empty and quiet, especially in the middle of the night. I miss you already.\" \"I miss you too, it was weird not waking up next to you.\" The two of them spent nearly two hours on the phone together before finally hanging up. They would have stayed on longer, but Catherine insisted Jackie take a nap after her rough night so she would be able to ace her audition the next day. One would think they wouldn't have much to say after staying up and talking the entire night before, and being inseparable for the past week, but they did. They were as happy as they had ever been despite the distance, and were finally starting to feel like a supportive and stable pair. Both positive things that were needed going into their three week hiatus from one another. After her nap, Jackie spent the rest of the night studying and learning her lines while Catherine gave Ethan some much needed attention back in Bloomington. Monday seemed to roll around sooner than Jackie was prepared for once the audition was over with. She came out of the second audition feeling better than she did the first, knowing Catherine had a lot to do with it. She had woken up at 5:00 A.M. the morning of just to call and wish Jackie luck, giving her that extra kick of confidence she needed. Now she was sitting in the airport waiting to board her plane to Europe, trying to stay positive about it. \"Hey, I'm about to board the plane\" she said, once Catherine picked up the phone. \"Are you okay, you seem more down than usual?\" \"Yeah, I just want to get this over with.\" \"I know, it'll be over before you know it though. Make sure to stay healthy and take those supplements I gave you.\" Jackie appreciated Catherine's concern but thought she was overreacting a bit. It was ten days in Europe, she'd be fine despite the exhaustion. \"I will, thank you. They're starting to board now so I better get off of here. I love you!\" \"Okay, call me when you land, I don't care what time it is. Love you too, be safe.\" Two days into the trip, Jackie started feeling under the weather. She thought it was just the jet lag but then she became congested and it started to affect her sleeping which wasn't making things any better. After another day full of interviews she called Catherine as she usually did. The nine hour time difference actually came to their advantage with Jackie's late nights. She was usually wrapping up her day while Catherine was in the middle of hers. \"Hey Porcupine,\" Catherine answered. \"Hey, how's your day?\" Catherine ignored the question, \"You sound terrible, are you sick?\" Jackie had been hiding her condition from Catherine since she had warned her about this happening. \"Yes, but please spare me the 'I told you so' speech. I beg you.\" Catherine laughed, \"typically I'd jump all over this, but you sound awful.\" \"I feel awful. I'm so tired and and it doesn't matter how hard I try, I can't get any sleep when I'm hardly even given time to get any.\" \"Did you take your supplements?\" \"Yeah.\" Jackie responded, trying to sound convincing. \"Jackie...\" Catherine pried, not buying her act. \"Okay, I might have skipped a few. Don't yell at me, my head hurts.\" \"Aw, poor baby. Can't you tell them to cut back on the schedule a bit?\" Jackie laughed, \"right.\" \"What's Rachel's number?\" \"No, I'm not letting you yell at anyone. I'm a big girl and can handle this.\" \"Fine, then you need to hang up and go to sleep. Try drinking some tea, and for God's sake take the supplements!\" \"Okay, I love you.\" \"Love you too, and Jackie?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I told you so,\" Catherine laughed before hanging up the phone. As the days progressed Jackie just kept getting worse and worse. One day, halfway through the trip, she literally couldn't go on without some relief. While on a break between interviews she called Catherine, \"I'm dying.\" \"Put Rachel on the phone. I won't be mean, I just want to tell her what to get you.\" Jackie struggled through the rest of the interviews, apologizing for her physical and mental state. After 9 painful hours her publicist finally pulled her out of her last two interviews after she had spaced out during the last. \"Jackie you need to go back to the hotel and get your act together before tomorrow when we start this all over again. You look like you're on drugs. Do you want those rumors to surface again?\" Not having enough energy to argue, she got in the car with Rachel and headed back to the hotel where a Z-Pak was waiting for her at the front desk. \"Catherine's recommendation,\" Rachel smiled, as she handed her the package. By the end of the trip, Jackie had just about enough of her publicists and manager. They had zero sympathy for her the entire time, pushing her to do more and criticizing her for not being at her best. She was sick of not being treated like an adult. Surprisingly Tommy, and Rachel of course, had been her only allies; standing up for her when the rest were beating her down. Without them she would have been lost. Catherine of course was furious, worried sick about her the entire trip wishing she could be there. Due to her exhaustion and illness, they weren't able to talk much since Jackie needed to sleep any chance she was given. Their last day was the Amsterdam premiere and Jackie was finally feeling better thanks to Catherine's Z-Pak. Before heading to the premiere she gave Catherine a quick call. \"Hey stranger, how do you feel?\" Catherine asked. \"Hey, I'm sorry we haven't talked much. I feel so much better though, thanks so much for the medicine. You are a lifesaver.\" \"Good you sound much better. It's okay, I'd rather you be rested and healthy.\" As good as she was at disguising it, Catherine was miserable. The last week and a half had been brutal not talking to Jackie, and she spent most of her time angry at the people surrounding her. She really liked Rachel but being her assistant, she wished she would have stepped up a little more to defend Jackie and her health. If she would have been there herself, things would have been a lot different. While she was talking to Jackie, she suddenly heard Tommy's voice in the background and Jackie giggling, ignoring her on the phone. \"Hey so I heard some good news today\" she said, trying to get Jackie's attention back. It didn't work, Jackie was still laughing and talking to Tommy. Someone sure was feeling better and it was starting to anger Catherine that she was wasting the little time they had fooling around with Tommy, who had been with her all week. \"Jackie...\" \"Yeah? What? I'm sorry Tommy had to tell me something.\" \"It's okay.\" Catherine tried to control her temper but she just kept picturing Tommy putting his hands on her. \"Did you say something about good news?\" Jackie asked, interrupting her thoughts. \"UCLA called, I have a second interview this week!\" \"No way! I'm so excited and happy! Now you can come visit!\" Once again Tommy interrupted them. \"So you and Tommy are on good terms again I see.\" \"Yeah, him and Rachel have really helped me out this week when everyone else has been so cruel.\" Jealousy suddenly filled Catherine's body. She should be there, not Tommy, taking care of Jackie. How was he taking care of her? Was he in her bedroom alone with her? \"Has he been behaving?\" She asked instead. \"Hold on a second.\" Catherine heard Jackie move the phone away from her mouth, \"Hey Tommy can you give me a sec? I'll meet you downstairs.\" After the sound of a door closing Jackie began talking again. \"You're not getting upset about this are you?\" \"I can't say I'm particularly thrilled with you being distracted by Tommy the entire time we've been talking, considering we hardly have been able to all week.\" \"I'm sorry, you're right. Things just get a little crazy around here during premiere days. I just kicked him out though so I'm all yours.\" \"I just wish I could of been there to take care of you rather than him.\" There were plenty of other words Catherine had about Tommy but she refrained from doing so. She didn't want to come off as crazy and jealous. \"I know. Trust me, I would much rather you be here than him. I miss you so much.\" Before Jackie had to go, they ended on a positive note but Catherine still couldn't wait for her to get home, and away from Tommy. She trusted Jackie, Tommy not so much. Jackie stared out the limo window, thinking about her phone call with Catherine. She felt guilty that she was distracted by Tommy but in no way was it intentional. Catherine made her hatred for Tommy very clear and Jackie couldn't blame her. She couldn't imagine Catherine jetting off to Europe for ten days with someone she shared a past with, especially the kind they had. The publicists interrupted her thoughts barking orders at her as usual, pushing her further to her limit. Before stepping out of the limo she sent Catherine one last text, \"I'm going to make this up to you XO.\"[Chapter 27] Jackie stepped out of the limo and took Tommy's arm, taking their regular stroll through the fans and photographers. As they entered the red carpet lined with reporters her heart began to race as she glanced back at the publicists. There wasn't any turning back now, she had made up her mind. She pulled Tommy's arm closer and leaned into him, moving her mouth to his ear, \"I'm sorry Tommy but I can't do this anymore.\" He looked back at her in confusion but once locking eyes, his face softened. \"Okay, you know they're going to give you hell for this though right?\" He warned, tilting his head towards the publicists. \"Yeah I know, but I just can't anymore. I'm sorry.\" \"I understand\" he said, letting go of her arm and smiling as he motioned her to go on without him. It only took two questions before the first reporter mentioned her relationship with Tommy. Jackie took a deep breath in before responding. \"You know, people just assumed we were together and I know I haven't done much to prevent them from thinking that, but we're actually just good friends.\" The reporter was a little caught off guard by the comment. \"Well I know a lot of young fans who are going to be devastated about this news, it seems as though they labeled you two as their their young 'IT' couple.\" Jackie turned and looked directly into the camera, \"well girls, I think it's great news for you all, because I know for a fact that Tommy is on the market\" she said winking. \"He's a great guy, any girl would be lucky to have him and I'm lucky to call him a friend.\" \"But never anything more?\" the reporter pried. Jackie smiled coyly, \"Let's just say that I am very happy with that part of my life right now and it doesn't involve Tommy.\" \"Oh really? Anyone we know?\" The reporter asked intrigued, knowing she had just landed a hot story. \"No, I've always tended to prefer to try and live a more normal life outside of my career, so I have always been more attracted to people not involved in the business.\" \"How long ago did this relationship transpire?\" \"I'm not going to answer that question, I know how you people work. If I give you a time range you'll go back and stalk every movement I made to see who I was with,\" Jackie teased. \"This person means the world to me and I'm just going to leave it at that.\" \"Okay, I can respect that and can tell you are very happy. I wish nothing but the best for you Ms. Kirk.\" \"I am very happy, thank you\" Jackie beamed. After shaking her hand goodbye, she turned around and saw the look on her publicists' faces and could tell they were not happy. \"Holy shit Jackie, did you tell anyone you were going to do that?\" Rachel asked, pulling her aside the moment the interview was over. \"No. After this week I'm done playing their games. This is my life and I'm in control of things now. But I have a job to finish so you can tell them that we can discuss this later if necessary,\" she said, removing Rachel's hand from her arm and moving on to the next reporter. Once the premiere was over the publicists pulled Jackie and Tommy into a room. \"What the hell was that?!\" They yelled. \"Tell me what I did wrong?\" Jackie asked sternly. \"We had an agreement. You two were supposed to ride this thing out until the very end.\" \"It is the end. I did my part and now I'm done.\" \"You need to run these things by us before you selfishly run your mouth to reporters.\" \"Hey, come on now\" Tommy said, putting his hands up and stepping in front of Jackie. \"She's been nothing but patient this entire time. She did what was asked of her, there's no need to attack her like this.\" \"It's our job to be your guys' filter. You need to run everything by us.\" \"It's really not that big of a deal,\" Jackie responded. \"And I am an adult, I can say whatever I please.\" \"Not that big of a deal? Let's see how you feel about that when you disappear from the public's interest.\" \"Are we done here?\" Jackie asked, before storming out. How could they be so rude to her, treating her as nothing more than their puppet. And how dare they call her selfish after she kept this Tommy thing up for so long, putting her real relationship on the line. She knew it was the last Neptune after party but was completely over this entire trip and everyone involved. Staying only an hour, she called it a night and went back to the hotel. After releasing some stress with a long, hot shower she called Catherine. \"What's wrong? Aren't you supposed to be at your premiere?\" Catherine asked. \"I left early. I just want to go to sleep so I can wake up and be on my way home\" she sighed, plopping down on the bed. \"What happened?\" Catherine asked concerned. \"I ended the Tommy facade once and for all.\" \"What do you mean? What did he do to you?\" \"What? Nothing. I told the reporters me and Tommy weren't together and that I was happy with someone else.\" \"No you didn't...\" \"Yes I did. I told you I was going to make it up to you. Problem is I didn't run it by the publicists because I knew they'd be against it, and let's just say they're not too happy with me right now.\" \"So you completely blindsided them?\" \"Yeah, and then they pulled me and Tommy into a room afterward and tore me apart.\" \"How does Tommy feel about it?\" \"He was completely supportive and even stuck up for me.\" \"Wow.\" \"I know right? He's been so different ever since New York.\" \"It seems like it. Is he still at the party?\" \"Yeah, why?\" Jackie asked, pulling herself up until she was sitting. \"Just wondering.\" She could tell Catherine was subtly trying get information on Tommy and couldn't understand why, especially since she just told her she completely ended things with him. Aside from walking in on Tommy in her apartment before they were even together, and their drunken misunderstanding, she hadn't done anything to warrant Catherine's jealousy. \"Catherine.\" \"Yeah?\" \"I just told a reporter at an international movie premiere that I wasn't with Tommy and was happily taken, and all you care about is where Tommy is?\" \"I know, I'm sorry. I'm proud of you. It's just been a long three weeks.\" \"Are you ever going to trust me? I've done nothing wrong. You know I'm not going anywhere, I thought this would've proven it.\" \"I know, I know.\" Catherine replied apologetically. \"I'm just going to go to sleep, I'll talk to you in the morning before my flight.\" Jackie was exhausted fighting with everyone and didn't have the energy to do the same with Catherine. She called her hoping she'd make her feel better but instead she was just intensifying her frustrations. \"No please, don't. I'm sorry. It really means a lot to me and I just need to get over the Tommy thing. I do trust you.\" Jackie talked to Catherine a little longer before calling it a night, venting her frustrations and eagerness to get home. The next morning she awoke to a message from her manager Matt, unhappy about the night before and telling her the PR meeting needed to be scheduled as soon as she returned to the States. On the way to the airport she gave Catherine a call but before she could talk, Catherine interrupted with great news that she had just received. \"Stanford called! I have an interview!\" Not having the heart to bring down her happiness with the dreaded PR meeting, she decided not to mention it yet, \"I told you they'd call! I'm so happy for you! We'll celebrate when you come to LA in a couple of days!\" The joy in Catherine's voice was infectious and lifted Jackie's spirits. She couldn't wait to get back home and see her. On the flight home she sat next to Rachel and the two talked all about their week in Europe and Jackie and Catherine's relationship. It felt good finally being able to talk to someone about Catherine. It removed so much built up stress talking through both her frustrations, and her happiness in their relationship. Jackie felt lucky to have Rachel in her life and their bond was only growing stronger. When they finally arrived back in the States, Jackie spent the entire first day in bed. After ten days of illness and no sleep, she refused to move and gave her body the proper rest it needed. Catherine was arriving in the morning for her second interview at UCLA, so she decided she'd better get her act together and step out into the world to do some grocery shopping. Despite the lack of enthusiasm, Catherine agreed to the PR meeting and it was scheduled during her visit, one of many reasons to pick up some wine while she was out. After putting away the groceries and cleaning her apartment she called it an early night, eager to pick up Catherine in the morning. Jackie opened her eyes looking around the room, wondering what had woken her. A few seconds later she heard knocking at her door and sat up in bed. It was after midnight, and her heart began racing, not knowing who it was. There was the knocking again. She slowly got out of bed and made her way down the hall, tip toeing to the door. When she looked through the peep hole her uneasiness turned into an overwhelming sense of excitement. She couldn't undo the locks fast enough before swinging open the door and throwing herself into Catherine's arms. Catherine held her tightly, pressing Jackie's head close against her as she laughed. \"You scared the shit out of me!\" Jackie said, squeezing her even tighter before stepping back. \"What are you doing here?!\" Her cheeks were already started to burn from smiling so hard. Catherine cupped her face in her hands, \"You're not the only one who can do all the surprising. I couldn't wait any longer to see you.\" Jackie grabbed her face and kissed her, not having enough control or desire to stop. After a few moments Catherine finally pulled away, \"aren't you going to invite me in?\" She laughed, \"It's pretty late and I have been traveling all day you know.\" Jackie smiled and tossed her bags into the apartment before grabbing Catherine's hand and pulling her inside. \"I missed you so much. My heart is literally going to explode right now.\" Catherine smiled and placed her hand on Jackie's chest to feel for herself. Jackie took her hand and kissed it before moving back to her lips, this time removing her jacket as they made their way back to Jackie's bedroom, leaving a trail of clothes.[Chapter 28] The next morning Catherine quietly slipped out of bed before Jackie awoke. Her surprise went even better than planned, so she was feeling quite perky this morning despite adjusting to the time difference. She imagined Jackie's jet lag was going to keep her in bed a little longer, so wanted to do something nice for her to make up for her awful trip. Expecting the worse, she was rather surprised after finding Jackie's refrigerator and cabinets stocked with food, and healthy food at that. After whipping up breakfast and brewing some coffee she snuck back into bed and kissed Jackie on the cheek. \"Wake up sleepy head.\" Jackie smiled before turning over and opening her eyes. \"I made you breakfast. Somebody was paying attention during my grocery lesson I see.\" \"What can I say, you're a damn good teacher,\" Jackie grinned. Catherine laughed and kissed her before pulling her out of bed. They spent the morning being lazy together, catching up on everything they had missed the last three weeks. In the afternoon they went for a hike before cooking dinner together and calling it an early night. The next day had quite a lot in store for them with Catherine's second interview at UCLA and their big PR meeting. Jackie drove Catherine to her interview and tried to fight through her uneasiness about the meeting before Catherine returned, not wanting to make her feel any more nervous than she already was. On the way there, Jackie had Catherine go into detail about her interview hoping to distract her. Upon their arrival at Wade's office, his secretary led them into a conference room where Matt and Wade were already seated. \"Jackie!\" Wade said, as he rose from his chair and came around to hug her. \"Hey Wade, you remember Catherine\" she said, motioning towards her. \"Of course I do! Hi Catherine, thanks for joining us.\" \"It's nice to meet you again,\" Catherine said, shaking his hand. Matt walked around and hugged Jackie as well. \"Hi Catherine, I'm Jackie's manager Matt. It's a pleasure to finally meet you.\" \"You as well,\" she replied. Once they sat down, Jackie's PR team arrived and it began to get as awkward as Jackie imagined, beginning with a cold hello. They weren't even warm to Catherine, just offering their hands from across the table. \"Okay, we called this meeting to prepare a sort of damage control, if you will, in regards to the two of yours relationship. After Jackie's little stunt in Europe, eyes are going to be all on her, seeing who this new mystery person is that she's involved with. Right now as far as the public knows, Jackie is a straight actress who has been spotted with young Hollywood men. This obviously isn't the case, so as you can imagine, it is going to cause some attention. Our plan is to welcome this attention but to prevent it from harming Jackie's career.\" \"And Catherine's career,\" Jackie chimed in, amending their statement. \"And what do you mean by this obviously isn't the case?\" Her publicist switched her focus between Jackie and Catherine, confused. \"What do you mean why? You're in a relationship with a woman are you not?\" \"Yes I am, but that doesn't mean I need a label attached to me. I've had relationships with men as well. Like I told Wade and Matt, I in no way shape or form want this being some big spectacle.\" \"Well it's going to be. I'm sorry, but it is. You're in a relationship with a female and as far as our society has come with accepting this lifestyle, it's still a shock factor in our world. Now, I understand that Catherine lost her job because of your ladies' relationship. That's where we need to start. In order to get our stories aligned and be prepared for any possible headline, we need to look forward and prepare for anything. To do that, we need both of your ladies' complete honesty and participation. The more you tell us the better. Okay?\" Jackie looked at Catherine and held her hand under the table, \"Okay\" Catherine responded. \"Okay good. To begin, what were the terms of your dismissal at the university?\" They asked Catherine. \"The head of the department was a close friend of my father's. He approached me privately and told me he would keep this quiet and let me finish the school year as long as I resigned.\" \"And did that all run smoothly?\" \"Yes. Rumors floated around as they usually did, but the pictures never surfaced and I was able to complete the year.\" \"What did these pictures entail?\" \"Jackie had gotten into a physical altercation with another student and had shown up to my house after the fact. The pictures show her on my front porch and then us retreating into my house.\" \"That's it?\" \"Yes, those are the two photos I was shown.\" \"Jackie, why did you get into a fight with the student?\" \"There was animosity between us all year. She accused me of getting good grades just because I was famous then later on revealed that she knew I was having an affair with Catherine. She made some inappropriate remarks and then we got into a physical altercation.\" Her publicists hardly showed any emotion as they scribbled down notes and typed on their laptops. \"Catherine, were there any other students you had relations with?\" Jackie squeezed her hand letting her know it was okay. \"Yes.\" She answered. \"How many?\" \"You don't need to know that,\" Jackie cut in. \"It would really help if we did so that we know exactly what we're dealing with in case they resurface.\" \"That's not necessary\" Wade responded, coming to their defense. \"Okay, fine. Did any of the other students you had affairs with cause any issues once it ended?\" \"No, not that I am aware of\" Catherine replied. \"Did any claim that you took advantage of them?\" Catherine let go of Jackie's hand and stared down at the table, biting on her upper lip. \"Catherine? Did any claim that you took advantage of them?\" They repeated. It felt as though they were on trial. \"Yes, I believe a couple of them did out of spite\" she answered reluctantly, sighing. Jackie looked over and could tell she was becoming uncomfortable. Her jaw was clenching and her eyes were beginning to water. \"Did you take advantage of any of them?\" \"Is this really necessary? Of course she didn't!\" Jackie blurted out \"Sorry but yes it is, we're only trying to help protect you two.\" \"No, I don't believe that I did. I always made it a point to make sure it was what they really wanted and that they were aware of what they were doing.\" \"She's completely right,\" Jackie butted in. \"Our first...\" She paused before continuing, trading glances with Wade and Matt, and let out a deep breath. \"Our first time, Catherine asked me multiple times if I wanted to stop and made sure I was okay. She told me I could leave at any time and to let her know if I was feeling uncomfortable.\" The publicists were completely expressionless staring down as they wrote. Jackie turned to Catherine but she wouldn't look at her. It was extremely awkward talking about her sex life in front of her peers so she knew Catherine had to be feeling even more uncomfortable talking about her past. \"Is there a reason why you always pursued students?\" \"Oh come on!\" Jackie laughed sarcastically.\"That's none of your business. She's not answering that, Catherine you're not answering that\" she said, as she looked at her. With a little hesitation they moved on. \"How would you pursue them?\" \"Stop it.\" Jackie warned. \"We're any under the age of 18?\" \"Absolutely not!\" Catherine said sternly, finally looking up. \"How did you know?\" \"I made sure of it\" she quickly answered. \"How were you able to do that?\" They began firing questions off, each one more inappropriate than the last. \"Enough!\" Jackie yelled. \"I'm sorry but the media are going to be a lot more invasive than this. They'll dig deep and find out everything. Even without finding ages there is a good chance they'll label Catherine as a pedophile. Jackie do you have any idea what this would do to your career considering your audience is mostly children and families?\" \"I don't care. I don't base my life and happiness off of other people's preconceived opinions of me.\" \"I'm sorry I can't do this anymore,\" Catherine said as she stood up and stormed out of the room, her voice quivering. \"We're done here.\" Jackie said as she looked them each in the eye before going after Catherine. She went ran out into the hall and couldn't find Catherine so went to the bathroom, not there either. \"Hey have you seen the woman I came in with by chance?\" Jackie asked the receptionist. \"Yes, she headed towards the elevators a few minutes ago.\" Jackie finally made it to the garage and found Catherine standing by her car. \"I'm so sorry,\" she said, putting her arms around her and giving her a hug. \"I knew that wasn't going to go well but had no idea it would be that bad.\" \"Can we just get out of here?\" Catherine responded, not making eye contact. Catherine stared out of the car window not saying a word the entire way back to Jackie's apartment. She was in no way upset with Jackie, just completely in shock over the meeting and didn't know what to say, let alone how she felt. When they finally got back to Jackie's, Catherine changed her clothes and began packing for her flight that was leaving to go back home later that evening. Jackie had given her space without even asking her if she needed it, which she appreciated. After about a half an hour later, she appeared at the bedroom door, timidly knocking asking if she could come in. \"Of course you can, it is your bedroom after all,\" Catherine slightly smiled. Jackie didn't say anything, just came in and sat on the bed and watched her pack her last few things. \"Can you talk to me?\" Jackie finally asked softly. Catherine turned around, \"I want you to know I'm not mad or upset with you at all, I'm just trying to absorb all of what just happened in there.\" Jackie rested her elbows on her knees and laid her head in her hands. \"I just want to make sure you're okay, you didn't deserve any of that.\" \"What I don't deserve is you,\" she said kneeling in front of her. \"I've never had someone stick up for me the way you did in there. I have a really, really ugly past and now it not only has caught up with me, but it's affecting you as well.\" \"I don't care. I know you. You're not anything like what people assume you to be.\" \"But I was. I hurt a lot of people and I was extremely selfish. It's taking me a while to become the person I'd love to be.\" \"That doesn't matter anymore, everyone has a time in their life they're not proud of. You have no reason not to love the person you've become, but I'll love you for the both of us until you do.\" Catherine smiled at her and brushed her hair behind her ear. Jackie grabbed her hands, \"Screw this place, do you mind if I hop on that plane with you tonight?\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, after the month I've had I just need a break from these people and this life. I just want to be back in Bloomington with you, even if it is just for a few days.\" \"Well you better get packing,\" Catherine smiled, before kissing her forehead.[Chapter 29] After taking a much needed mini break from Hollywood, Jackie promised Wade and Matt that she would still attend the final Neptune party. Catherine's interview at Stanford was the same day so Jackie was excited that she'd be able to join. On her last night in Bloomington, Jackie was sitting on the couch with Ethan, drinking a glass of wine while looking at pictures of outfits that Rachel had sent her. Catherine came into the room and joined her on the couch as Jackie showed her the pictures. \"What do you think you want to wear to the party?\" \"I've been meaning to talk to you about that.\" \"If you give me an idea of what you want to wear, I can have Rachel pick out a few different options.\" Catherine was nervous but knew it wasn't fair to Jackie to ditch her at the last minute. She had to tell her. \"I don't think I'm going to make it.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jackie looked up from her phone, confused. \"My Stanford interview is that afternoon.\" \"I know, the more reason to celebrate. I'll book you a flight or I'll come with you and we can drive back. It's not a premier so I don't need to be there at any set time.\" \"I don't know if it's a good idea If I keep showing up at your events. People are going to start to get suspicious, especially since they know you're in a relationship now. You heard what the publicists said, they're going to be watching you like a hawk.\" \"What's wrong with that? I thought we were moving forward with this?\" \"I told you I wanted to settle into a job before we even played around with the idea of becoming public.\" \"Playing around with the idea of it? We're back to that?\" Jackie's facial expressions began to harden. Catherine just looked at her, knowing this wasn't going to go well. \"Three weeks ago you kissed me on the curb in the middle of one of the busiest airports in the world, and now you're telling me you don't want to be seen with me in public? Jesus Christ Catherine, you're giving me whiplash!\" Jackie said furiously, as she stood up. \"When is it okay for you to be seen with me and when isn't it, because I'm exhausted trying to keep up. Do I need to check in with you everyday now?\" \"Honestly, that PR meeting scared the hell out of me Jackie. It seems like no one is in my corner, and hearing how ruthless the media can be absolutely terrifies me. This is my career and life we're talking about.\" \"I'm in your corner. I've always been in your corner\" Jackie said, pounding her fingertip into her chest. \"Willing to do whatever you wanted to do, but from day one you've done nothing but go back and forth. First you tell me we're breaking up because you don't want me referring to you as a \"college buddy.\" Then five seconds later when I tell you I'm completely in this, you tell me you don't want to go public. Fast forward almost two years later and here we are again, so which is it Catherine?\" \"It's not that simple! There's a lot to figure out, I've never done this before let alone with someone like you. You were just supposed to be another one night stand like the rest of them. Then you came along and-\" Jackie interrupted her, \"then I came along and messed up your whole life. I made you lose your job, I ruined everything.\" \"You know that's not what I mean and you know that's not true. It's just really complicated and I'm trying to figure it all out. Our relationship would be hard enough to explain to people given our ages and gender, but now that you're back in the spotlight... it's just difficult.\" \"Well if it's this difficult being with me then maybe you shouldn't.\" \"Don't.\" Catherine replied, shaking her head. \"No it's fine. It's not like I never had to deal with this before. My own mother couldn't handle this lifestyle so I don't know why I expected you to be able to.\" Jackie set the wine glass down on the table and headed upstairs. \"Where are you going?\" \"Home.\" Not even a minute later she came back down with her bag in her hand. \"Jackie stop, you're blowing this all out of proportion. Do you not understand how difficult this is for me? You heard the publicists, if the media gets a hold of my past they'll make me out to be a predator.\" \"Yes, because I'm just a child,\" she said smugly. \"Can you please stop! Stop putting words in my mouth, it's not fair.\" \"Fair? You have the right to decide what's fair with the way you've treated this entire relationship?\" \"You're forgetting who left in the first place!\" Catherine blurted out in defense, regretting it as soon as the words escaped her mouth. Jackie's eyes almost doubled in size and her mouth dropped. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I'm just feeling attacked right now.\" Jackie just looked at her, then clenched her jaw. \"Good luck at your interview,\" she said as she stormed out, slamming the door behind her. Catherine let out a sigh and took a minute to gather herself before going outside. Jackie was at the bottom of the drive way on the phone. When she got closer she realized she was talking with the airlines, trying to get an earlier flight. She grabbed the phone from her hand, \"Never mind, thanks for the help,\" Catherine told the operator before hanging up. \"What the hell are you doing, give it back!\" \"Jackie you're not leaving, it's late and you're angry. I'll drive you to the airport tomorrow.\" \"I don't want to be here!\" \"Either keep your voice down or come inside.\" Catherine snapped. \"Take me to a hotel.\" \"No.\" \"Then give me my phone back so I can call a cab\" she said, holding out her hand. Catherine turned and walked inside, with Jackie's phone in hand. She wasn't letting her leave this upset. \"Catherine give me my fucking phone!\" Jackie yelled as she stormed back into the house. \"No, not until you calm down.\" Jackie went over to the couch and angrily sat down as she rested her chin on her fist. \"I don't want you leaving like this.\" Jackie stayed silent, not even looking at her. \"I'm really scared Jackie. I'm scared I'll lose my job again, so I'm being a coward. I admit it. But that doesn't mean I don't want to be with you. I'm scared to lose you too.\" \"Is this why we stayed in the hotel almost the entire time we were at Berkeley? You didn't want anyone to see me with you?\" Jackie said, as she snapped her head towards her. Catherine just looked at her, not knowing what to say. She had obviously been holding that in for a few weeks. \"You're ashamed to be seen with me?\" \"Of course not\" she said, sitting down next to her. \"I don't want anything more than to be with you. That's exactly why I keep going from one extreme to the other. Anytime I'm with you I just want to be with you, but then I think of the worst case scenario that your publicists warned us about.\" \"So what's the end game here Catherine? I can't change my age or gender. Do you want me to quit acting? I know that's it because let's be honest, you've been hanging the fact that I left over my head this entire time. As soon as I took the job you began punishing me and pushing me away.\" \"No. I don't want you to sacrifice anything, and I just wish you'd reciprocate that feeling.\" Jackie looked up at her. \"So what? You want me to start bringing Tommy as my date to events again?\" \"Now you're just being hateful.\" Jackie got up from the couch and started walking out of the room. \"Where are you going now?\" \"If you're not going to let me leave then I'm going to bed.\" Catherine stayed downstairs giving Jackie the space she needed to cool off. When she finally went upstairs Jackie wasn't in her bed. She walked down the hall and slowly opened the guest bedroom to find Jackie sound asleep. She quietly tip toed to the side of the bed and placed Jackie's phone on the nightstand. It took everything she had in her, not to curl up in bed next to her but she was hoping by morning she would be more level headed. Catherine woke up, not getting much sleep the night before, and opened Jackie's door but the bed was empty. When she went downstairs there wasn't any sign of her there either. As she looked around the kitchen, she found a note lying on the counter: Took a cab to airport Catherine couldn't believe she left without even saying goodbye. She was obviously a lot more hurt than she thought. She went to the door and looked outside, hoping the cab hadn't picked her up yet, but there was no sight of her. After running upstairs to retrieve her phone, she dialed Jackie's number. As she was pacing the foyer she suddenly heard a phone ringing from outside. When she opened the door, relief rushed through her body when she saw Jackie in front of her, sitting on the steps. \"Can I please drive you to the airport?\" \"Why? You don't want to be seen with me, I'm just saving you the stress.\" \"Don't be like this.\" Catherine sat down next to her, \"are we seriously going to part on bad terms?\" \"My cab is going to be here any minute so I guess so.\" Her arms were crossed as they usually were when she was this angry. \"Can you at least talk to me? I'm not exactly comfortable with the idea of leaving on a bad note when you're about to get on an airplane. My past experiences have taught me never to do that.\" \"We're obviously on different pages when it comes to our relationship, which is news to me. It would really mean a lot to me for you to be there tomorrow but you're not, so I don't have anything left to say to you right now that won't make things worse.\" Catherine stared at her but she wouldn't even look at her. \"I'm sorry I can't give you what you want right now,\" she said softly. The cab pulled into the drive way and Jackie stood to leave. Catherine got up and hugged her but Jackie didn't return the embrace. \"I love you,\" Catherine whispered. \"I love you too. But I'm only saying that because of what you said about airplanes.\" And with that she was gone, not even looking back once.[Chapter 30] Jackie stepped off of the plane and walked through the airport completely ignoring her surroundings. She was hoping no one would notice her given she wasn't exactly in the mood to entertain. As much as she was hurting she had yet to cry, still too angry above anything else. While standing in baggage claim, she switched on her phone and saw Catherine's message asking to let her know when she landed. Not giving her the satisfaction of a phone call, she sent a one word text, \"Landed.\" Catherine went to retrieve her keys from the desk when she spotted it, her lacrosse T-shirt folded on a chair. Jackie must have left it before leaving this morning. She picked it up and held it close, breathing in Jackie's scent, heart broken at the gesture. After she returned home later she kept her phone close, knowing Jackie's plane should be landing soon. As she was fixing dinner she finally heard it vibrate on the counter, her eagerness soon dissipated once she saw the short response \"Landed.\" Jackie grabbed her bag from the carousel and was walking to the parking garage when her phone began to ring, Catherine obviously wasn't a fan of her message. She hit ignore and continued on her way. What else could she possibly have left to say to her? Thirty minutes later while stuck in traffic, Catherine called for a third time. Completely agitated at this point, she picked up. \"Catherine I'm stuck in traffic trying to get home, can you please stop bothering me? I'm in a bad enough mood as it is.\" \"I'm not trying to bother you, we need to talk. Call me when you get home.\" \"I'll think about it.\" \"Jackie please...\" Jackie hung up. Three hours had passed and Catherine still hadn't heard a word from Jackie. Her flight to Stanford was in the morning and she was supposed to end her trip in LA with Jackie, but now she wouldn't even speak to her. She texted her hoping she would get some sort of response this time, \"Please talk to me. I'm going to bed for my early flight. I'm still planning on coming to LA after, will you at least talk to me then?\" Jackie was sitting on the couch, deep into a bottle of wine when she saw the message. She rolled her eyes and tossed the phone across the couch. A few moments later she looked over at it, knowing she had to at least give her an answer. \"Yeah, we'll talk then.\" The following evening Jackie was struggling to get moving so told Rachel she would just meet her at the party. \"Where's Catherine?\" Rachel asked, looking behind her as soon as she met Jackie at the door. \"I don't want to talk about it\" she responded, grabbing a martini from the waiters tray, swallowing the entire thing in one gulp. She placed the glass back down then slid the olive off of the tooth pick with her teeth, throwing the pick back into the glass. \"It's going to be one of those nights, huh?\" \"You bet\" she said, walking in front of Rachel without a care in the world. \"Did you guys break up?\" \"What did I say?\" Jackie snapped back at her. \"Okay, okay. Sorry.\" Rachel said, putting her hands up in surrender. Catherine returned to the hotel after her Stanford interview and checked her phone. Jackie hadn't returned any of her messages since this morning when she let her know she had landed. Even then she just received a \"K.\" She tried not to let it bother her since they would see each other soon, but she was hurt that she didn't even wish her luck for her big interview. Hopefully they would resolve their issues or at least compromise and meet in the middle. Since she was at Stanford, Catherine went ahead and made dinner plans with an old college friend she hadn't seen in years. She decided not to let the others know she was in town considering she wasn't exactly in the mood to discuss her love life. During dinner she checked her phone while her friend was in the restroom, unable to resist to see if Jackie replied. Nothing. It was then that she noticed the battery was only at 5%. She turned it off and stuck it in her purse to try and save the battery, not like Jackie would respond to her anyway considering she was at her party now. It was barely past 10 o'clock and Jackie was well on her way to blacking out. Pre-gaming with a bottle of wine as she got ready probably wasn't the wisest idea. After stumbling into a couch, she collapsed in it for a minute to take a breather. She pulled out her phone and reread all of the messages Catherine had sent her since leaving Bloomington. She began to feel guilty for not wishing her luck today but didn't even know where they stood anymore. Thankfully Catherine was driving up to see her first thing in the morning before flying home. Ignoring her was supposed to teach her a lesson, that she didn't get to call all of the shots in this relationship. But Jackie was really missing her. She didn't want to admit it, but she understood why Catherine was so nervous. The media were snakes and would without a doubt make her out to be some sort of predator. It didn't make this any easier though, she thought they were finally moving forward for once. Would they ever be able to make this work? The alcohol was really starting to get to her, making her become emotional so she broke down and texted Catherine. \"I'm sorry for not wishing you luck. I hope your interview went well, I really do.\" When Catherine returned to the hotel after dinner she took a shower before remembering her phone was turned off. When she grabbed it from her purse it wouldn't even turn on so she dug through her bags to find her charger. \"Great,\" she mumbled to herself after searching for it for five minutes. She must have forgotten to pack it. Picking up the hotel phone she dialed the front desk asking if they sold cell phone chargers. \"No we don't, I'm sorry Ma'am but there is a convenience store about five minutes down the road.\" \"Great thank you,\" she responded. \"Damn't\" she whispered to herself, it was already almost 11 o'clock and she didn't feel like having to venture out into town again. \"There you are! I've been looking for you everywhere!\" Rachel said, as she plopped down on the couch next to Jackie. \"I'm going to head out do you need a ride?\" \"Why won't she answer me Rachel,\" Jackie pouted. \"Catherine?\" \"Yes,\" she moaned. \"So are you finally going to talk about it without biting my head off?\" \"She wouldn't come tonight. We had a meeting with PR last week and they scared her by saying if the media finds out about her past, they'll label her as a predator. Because of that she's scared to be seen with me now, so we got into a huge fight back in Bloomington and have hardly talked since.\" \"I mean I can't really blame her, can you?\" \"Yes! I should be more important!\" Rachel just looked at her. \"Ugh, but no, I can't blame her.\" Jackie said, sighing. \"I just love her so much. Why can't we figure this out already.\" \"It's not easy dating someone in the spot light, you need to give her more credit. She already lost her job once because of you.\" \"I know, but it's hard.\" \"The things worth the most in life are usually the hardest. Come on let's get out of here.\" \"No, I'm going to stay.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah, the longer I'm here the more busy my mind will stay before I see her tomorrow.\" \"Alright, well I'll see you later.\" After Jackie hugged Rachel goodbye she got another drink and sat at the bar waiting for Catherine to text her. After an hour of no response she texted her again. \"I wish you'd answer me. I love you so much. I can't wait to see you tomorrow. Wish you were here right now, xo.\" Jackie was kicking herself for not leaving with Rachel, now all she wanted was to go home. She got up from the bar stool and stumbled to the door, leaving the party. As she stood outside trying to decide how she was going to get home, she saw Tommy out of the corner of her eye making his way to the valet. \"Hey Jacks, need a ride?\" She stared at him contemplating what to do. She was far too inebriated to drive herself, but would rather not take a cab alone this wasted. Catherine would be so angry if she found out she left with Tommy, but this is what she gets for not wanting to be with her publicly. Why wasn't she answering her phone anyway? After wrestling with the decision she finally decided to get into the car. When Catherine returned from the convenience store, she plugged her phone into charge before turning off the lights and attempting to get some sleep. A few minutes later her phone began vibrating uncontrollably. Jackie must finally be responding now that she's had some alcohol in her system, she thought. After leaning over to retrieve it she saw 9 missed calls from Rachel. Her heart immediately dropped into her stomach as she dialed her number. Jackie... \"Catherine!\" Rachel answered, sobbing on the other end of the phone. \"What's wrong Rachel? Is Jackie okay?\" Catherine frantically asked. Rachel struggled to get out the words before finally spitting out, \"There-there's been an accident.\"[Chapter 31] \"Is Jackie okay?!\" Catherine repeated, raising her voice, unable to move. \"I don't-I don't know, I just got to the hospital now but they had to cut her out of the car.\" \"What hospital Rachel.\" Catherine was now pacing the floor running her fingers through her hair. All she heard was her muffled crying. \"Rachel! What hospital?!\" She shouted. Catherine quickly contemplated what to do, her head was spinning. It was a gut wrenching 5 1/2 hour drive to Jackie, but she wasn't sure how long it'd take to fly there. She dialed the airlines as she quickly threw all of her belongings into her bag. \"I'm sorry Ma'am, the next flight doesn't leave until morning.\" Of course. Catherine grabbed her keys and headed straight to the car, with the longest drive ahead of her that she'd ever have to make. The entire drive she kept playing their fight over and over in her head. After hanging up with Rachel she saw all of the text messages Jackie had sent her, which made everything that much worse. The guilt was tearing her up inside knowing that Jackie was trying to get a hold of her all night and was upset. She should of been there at the party with her. If she had, Jackie would have never been in that car. Now she was unconscious in a hospital thinking Catherine didn't love her anymore and was ignoring her, which was the furthest thing from the truth. She finally reached the hospital in a record breaking 5 hours, which was still too long. She had Rachel call her whenever she had an update, all she knew was Jackie was in surgery and was in a car accident with Tommy. She ran into the emergency room and heard someone call her name. Rachel appeared behind her and hugged her. \"Is she okay? Is she awake?\" \"She's still in surgery but the doctors didn't seem concerned\" Rachel replied, as she held her tightly. \"What do we know so far?\" Catherine asked, pulling away. \"I went and checked on Tommy. His car hit a telephone pole, on her side. She fractured her leg and dislocated her shoulder which needed surgery on. She also has some stitches on her head from the windshield shattering and a couple of bruised ribs. Tommy got the least of it, just a sprained wrist and some stitches.\" Catherine put her hands up to her mouth in shock, \"how did this happen?\" Rachel looked around before pulling her aside, \"Tommy was drunk. He's being arrested for a D.U.I. once he's released, and who knows what else considering how badly Jackie was injured,\" she whispered. Catherine's entire body filled with rage and her fists clenched. \"Where is he?\" \"Don't,\" Rachel said placing her hand on her shoulder. \"Trust me, he feels terrible enough.\" Catherine tried breathing in deeply to put her anger aside, she needed to focus all of her energy on Jackie. \"Come on, let's go sit in the OR's waiting room. Do you want some coffee or anything? I know you've been driving awhile.\" \"You don't need to play assistant right now,\" Catherine smiled compassionately. \"I'm not.\" Rachel responded. \"You're the closest person to Jackie. I'm a mess so I can't even begin to imagine how you're feeling.\" \"We had just gotten in a big fight,\" Catherine said shamefully, as her eyes began to well up. \"I know, she told me. That's not important right now though. She knows you love her and you know she loves you more than anything else in this world. If anyone should feel guilty it's me. I left her alone at that party. If I would've stayed she never would have gotten in the car with him. They were both so drunk, I didn't think either one of them would drive,\" Rachel started to cry and Catherine put her arm around her. \"No, I should've been there. I'm never going to stop regretting that. You didn't know.\" The doors opened and a doctor came walking out. \"That's him!\" Rachel said, touching Catherine's arm as she stood. \"Are you two Jacqueline Kirk's family?\" \"No but we're all she has,\" Rachel responded. \"Okay. Well, the surgery was successful, it went very well. She'll need some physical therapy eventually to help loosen it up a bit, but everything looks good.\" \"Is she awake? Can we see her?\" Catherine asked eagerly. \"She is still unconscious but should be awake soon. I'm sorry but we can only allow two people at a time in the ICU, and one needs to be family.\" \"She's estranged from her family. I'm her significant other, can I please see her?\" Catherine knew what she said out loud and it didn't even phase her. None of that matter to her right now, all that mattered was seeing Jackie. The doctor looked at her reluctantly then finally allowed her back, thank god they were in California. \"You go, I'll give you some privacy.\" Rachel said, placing her arm on Catherine's shoulder. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah I'm going to go home and change, it's been a long night. Can you let me know when she's awake?\" \"Of course.\" Catherine said hugging her, \"thanks for everything.\" As Catherine and the doctor made their way down the hall, he paused before entering Jackie's room. \"I just want to warn you that it looks a lot worse than it is. Victim's loved ones usually have a difficult time first seeing them, but I assure you all of the swelling and bruising will go down.\" Catherine's heart sunk and she became light headed, how bad was she going to look?[Chapter 32] Catherine's heart sank deep into her stomach as soon as she laid eyes on Jackie. Her entire face was swollen and bruised, what she saw of it at least. Gauze was covering the majority of her forehead and an oxygen mask was covering the rest. Her arm was bandaged in a sling and her lower leg in a cast. \"I know it's a lot to look at, but she's going to be just fine. The leg was just a fracture, but she's still going to be off of her feet for several weeks.\" Catherine felt his hand on her shoulder, \"you can go sit with her, she should be up in about an hour or so. I'll be back later to explain everything to her.\" \"Thank you,\" Catherine said softly, unable to say anything else. She walked over and stood above Jackie, closely studying her injuries. \"Oh Porcupine...\" She whispered, her voice cracking. She leaned down and gently kissed Jackie's forehead, before pulling the chair over to the bed and carefully taking her hand. She kissed it gently, not wanting to cause her anymore pain. \"I'm so sorry.\" Why had she let such trivial things get between them. Jackie did so much for her and Catherine let her fear of other people's opinions get in the way of their happiness. From taking a beating from classmates to going against her PR team, Jackie had always put herself on the line for Catherine. A nurse suddenly entered the room, interrupting her thoughts. \"Don't mind me Sweetie, I'm just coming to get her vitals.\" Catherine just looked up and smiled politely. \"Is she your sister?\" \"No, she's my girlfriend\" Catherine said softly. \"Oh, I'm sorry Honey. I shouldn't have assumed.\" \"Don't be. It's going to take some time for me to get use to saying that myself.\" \"Everything looks great, you give this button a push when she wakes up, okay Sweetie?\" \"I will, thank you.\" Jackie awoke to loud beeping. She was incredibly drowsy, her body and face felt heavy and weighted down. Everything was tingling yet aching, her head pounding. When she tried opening her eyes, they wouldn't open all the way. Everything was blurry but she could see the swollen features of her face crowding her vision. When her eyes began to focus some, she looked around and started to notice the machines and tubes consuming her body. She was in a hospital. Frightened, her breathing began to increase and she started to feel like she was suffocating. She saw her hot breath fogging the oxygen mask that was covering her nose and mouth, and lifted her arm to remove it, but it wouldn't move. She twitched her other hand but it too was being weighed down. The beeping of the machines increased as she began to panic, watching her chest raise up and down as she struggled to breathe. Suddenly she saw the outline of a person hovering over her, her hand finally freeing. She brought it to her face and grabbed at the mask, removing it and gasping for air. \"Jackie, shhhh.. You're okay.\" The voice was comforting and familiar. \"It's Catherine, I'm here. You're going to be okay.\" Catherine was here. What happened? Where were they? \"Nurse!\" Catherine shouted as she banged on the buttons of a remote. A nurse ran in and placed the mask back on Jackie's face as she struggled with her to take it off again. \"Honey, you need this to breathe. Take nice slow breaths,\" she said as she held it down on Jackie's face. Jackie looked at Catherine with desperation, grabbing for her arm. She could see the fear in Catherine's eyes even through the fogginess. \"Can't she take it off for a minute? Please, just until she calms down?\" The nurse finally agreed and Catherine gently caressed the side of her face as Jackie tried to slow her breathing. \"Do you know what happened, Honey?\" The nurse asked. Jackie slowly shook her head no. \"You were in a car accident, but you're going to be just fine.\" She glanced down at her bandaged body and felt tears slip down her cheeks as she tried to steady her breathing, terrified of her unknown condition. \"Hey,\" Catherine said softly. Jackie looked up at her. \"You're okay, nothing too serious. I promise\" she said, as she wiped her tears. \"How is your pain level? Would you like some medicine?\" The nurse asked. Jackie shook her head yes. The pain in her head was unbearable and the aching throughout her body was quickly sharpening. The look in Jackie's eyes when the nurse was pressing the mask down on her face, broke Catherine's heart. She was terrified and grasping for Catherine to help her. Once her breathing began to regulate the nurse went to retrieve the pain medicine, leaving them alone. \"I am so sorry Porcupine. I should have been there.\" Jackie squeezed her hand. \"Here you go Sweetie,\" the nurse said when she returned. \"This is going to make you drowsy so you're probably going to fall back asleep.\" \"Water,\" Jackie tried to say, but her voice was scarce. \"I can't give you water yet but I can get you something to help alleviate some of the dryness.\" She removed a stick with a small sponge at the end of it, from a wrapper. After dipping it in water, she applied it to Jackie's dry, cracked lips. \"You can do this for her as much as she wants, just don't let her swallow too much water. I'll leave you two alone,\" the nurse said, placing the mask back on Jackie's face. \"Page me if you need anything else. Get some rest Sweetheart.\" Jackie could feel the medicine quickly kicking in. Her eyes began to feel heavy as the tingling increased, rushing through her veins. She looked up at Catherine, wanting to know the whole story, but was too tired to try and speak. Her drowsiness heightened, jumbling her thoughts and dragging her back into unconsciousness. She felt Catherine take her hand and whisper how sorry she was again. Trying to fight the affects for a little longer, she reached up to lift the mask, but Catherine placed her hand on it. \"You need to keep it on, I know it's uncomfortable. I'm sorry\" Jackie pointed to her heart but Catherine didn't understand. \"Does your chest hurt?\" She slowly shook her head no and pointed to the mask again. \"Just for a minute, just so you can tell me what's wrong,\" Catherine said as she gently lifted the mask from Jackie's face. Jackie swallowed and tried her hardest to speak, \"I love you\" she whispered, hoping Catherine could understand before allowing the drugs to completely consume her. \"I love you too Porcupine,\" Catherine said as she kissed her hand once more. Jackie's eyes were hardly opening now. \"You can go to sleep, I'm not going anywhere.\" Jackie's thumb weakly rubbed her hand until it finally went limp, causing Catherine to completely break down for the first time. \"Honey there's family rooms you can stay in down the hall, why don't you go take a nap\" The nurse said, waking Catherine. \"I'm fine,\" Catherine replied, rubbing her eyes. \"I can wake you when she wakes up again,\" the nurse insisted. \"Thank you but I don't want to leave her.\" An hour later Catherine grabbed a quick coffee from the waiting room. When she returned Jackie was whimpering in her sleep, sweating and trembling. Catherine set the coffee down and sat on the bed, placing the back of her hand on Jackie's forehead, she was burning up. Jackie slowly opened her eyes and looked at Catherine. \"Are you in pain?\" Jackie shook her head yes, her swollen face wincing. \"Okay, I'll call the nurse.\" After the nurse administered the medicine she raised Jackie's bed slightly. \"The doctor is on his way to come talk to you.\" Catherine grabbed one of the sponges and slowly drug it across Jackie's lips. She then picked up a cool wash cloth and carefully dabbed Jackie's forehead. When she glanced down at her, their eyes met. \"I'm beginning to think you just really enjoy me taking care of your poor head.\" Jackie attempted a smile and Catherine kissed her forehead before a knock was on the door and the doctor entered. Catherine slid off of the bed and held Jackie's hand. \"Well hi there Miss Kirk. I'm your surgeon, Dr. Jones and I'm here to talk to you about the extent of your injuries. Are you aware that you were in a car accident?\" Jackie shook her head yes. \"Do you remember the accident?\" Jackie let go of Catherine's hand and slowly moved it side ways. \"Okay, well you were a passenger in a vehicle that collided into a telephone pole. You dislocated your shoulder which needed to be operated on, as there was a tear in your ligament, and some glass from the window that needed to be removed. Everything looks good though from that standpoint, but you will need some physical therapy to help regain full mobility of it. You also fractured your leg which was casted as you can see, and you have a few bruised ribs that will be tender for a while. The windshield also shattered which resulted in lacerations to your forehead, so you have several stitches but not to worry, scaring will be very minimal. Now, do you have any questions for me?\" Jackie stared forward in shock and shook her head no. \"Okay, well we want to keep you a few days for observation so I will be back daily to check in, in case you think of any later.\" As soon as he left Jackie lifted her hand up to feel her face but Catherine stopped her, \"the swelling will go down, you're still beautiful don't worry.\" \"You have quite the girlfriend here, she stayed by your side the entire time,\" the nurse winked. \"I'll give you two some privacy. I do have a treat for you though. The doctor gave the okay to move you up to ice chips,\" she said, placing the cup down. \"Next will be getting you off of the oxygen mask which I'm sure you're looking forward to.\" Jackie didn't respond. Still just staring straight ahead, absorbing everything. After a couple minutes of silence had past, Catherine stood up. \"Ice?\" she asked, shaking the cup and smiling. Jackie nodded and lifted her hand to remove the mask but struggled. \"Here let me,\" Catherine said as she set down the cup and gently removed it. Jackie put her hand on Catherine's arm and looked at her through her swollen face. Catherine smiled and softly rubbed her finger on her cheek. \"Tommy?\" Jackie whispered. \"He's okay. Just stitches and a sprain. I know it's hard but try and rest your poor voice, it sounds so painful.\" After her first bite Jackie spoke again, \"Girlfriend?\" Catherine smiled, \"Yes. You know, you didn't have to go through such great lengths to get me to stop being so stubborn.\" Jackie smiled but they were interrupted when Rachel burst through the door, \"Jackie!\" \"Careful,\" Catherine warned. \"You're up! I'm so happy to see you up! Look at you, you poor thing. Are you in a lot of pain?\" \"She can't talk well yet. The nurse just came by and gave her some pain medicine, and the doctor just left.\" \"Oh, so she knows what all happened?\" \"Yes.\" \"Man it sure didn't take long for the media to get the scoop. It's all over the news and the paparazzi are lined up outside, waiting for the police to come take Tommy.\" Catherine winced at Rachel's remark when she saw Jackie's reaction. \"Shit. Did I say something I shouldn't have?\" Rachel asked. \"Cops?\" Jackie whispered hoarsely.[Chapter 33] Jackie traded glances back and forth between Rachel and Catherine before finally shouting \"tell me!\" Once the words hoarsely escaped her throat she began to cough and grasped her chest in pain. \"Careful, don't strain yourself,\" Catherine said as she began rubbing her back. Jackie pushed her away with her good arm. \"Tell me!\" She whispered angrily. \"I thought you said she knew everything?\" Rachel asked apologetically. \"She knows she was in a car accident.\" Catherine replied. Rachel walked over and sat down next to her. \"Jackie... Tommy was drunk. Really drunk. He's being arrested for a D.U.I. and they're charging it as a felony since you were harmed so badly.\" Jackie shifted her focus from Rachel and stared straight forward, not saying a word, her eyes in a daze. Catherine leaned forward and placed her hand on Jackie's. \"Are you okay?\" Not looking at her, Jackie shook her head yes and quietly whispered that she was tired, asking for her bed to be lowered back down so that she could sleep. Catherine did as asked, looking at Rachel concerned. \"Catherine I can stay with her for a while if you want to go sleep, shower, whatever.\" \"I'm okay.\" \"Go\" Jackie said, opening her eyes. Catherine looked at her confused and somewhat hurt. Why was she suddenly being so cold to her? Was she blaming Catherine now that she knew it was all her fault for not coming to the party? \"Go to my apartment. I need clothes\" Jackie said, finishing her statement. \"She's right. She's going to need clothes when they release her. They had to cut hers off of her and they were covered in blood anywa-Sorry\" Rachel stopped herself realizing she was saying too much. \"Okay, please stay with her. If her mouth gets dry her ice is on the tray and this is the button for the nurse. She just had her pain medication so she should be fine until I get back but-\" \"Catherine, we will be fine\" Rachel interrupted, smiling. \"Okay.\" Catherine leaned down and kissed Jackie on the forehead, \"I'll be back soon.\" Jackie didn't smile back, just slightly nodded. \"Thanks Rachel, call me if anything changes.\" As soon as Catherine left Rachel stood up, \"Jackie I didn't want to bring this up in front of Catherine, but Tommy really wants to see you before they take him away. This is all eating him up inside, he feels incredibly guilty. I understand, and he understands if you don't want to see him, but he just wants to apologize and make sure you're okay.\" \"Go get him\" Jackie whispered, without any sort of hesitation. Catherine rushed to Jackie's apartment, immediately taking a shower, wanting to get back to the hospital as soon as possible. It had taken her a lot longer to exit the hospital than she planned. Rachel was right, the media were swarming outside. After freshening up she went through Jackie's things, packing a few different outfits, not knowing what she'd be most comfortable in. As she made her way back into the living room, she threw their bags on the couch and noticed three wine bottles sitting on the coffee table. She went over and picked each one up, noticing every single one was empty. How on earth could one person drink that much wine when she wasn't even home for long. ,Her thoughts went back to how angry Jackie was with her that day, and the depressing text messages she received from her. Catherine collapsed onto the couch, covered her eyes with her hands and began to sob uncontrollably. What was she doing to Jackie. How could she cause someone she loved this much pain. When she returned to the hospital she was optimistic, wanting to be there for Jackie in every way possible through this recovery. But as soon as she entered Jackie's room the smile on her face disappeared. \"What the hell is he doing in here?\" Tommy looked back at her. He was sitting next to Jackie's bed with her hand in his, Jackie propped up in bed. \"Tommy was just coming to make sure Jackie was okay\" Rachel cut in. \"Get out.\" Catherine said furiously, pointing to the door. \"Catherine, please I just wanted to come apologize\" Tommy explained. \"Look at her, she's not okay. Look what you did to her. Now get out!\" Tommy began to get up but Jackie took hold of his hand. Catherine looked down at their hands and didn't understand what was happening. She turned her attention to Jackie but she offered no insight, just looked back with empty eyes, leaving Catherine numb until Rachel pushed her out into the hallway. \"What's going on here? Is this why she asked me to leave?\" \"She knew you'd react like this. Catherine just give them a minute, they just went through something pretty horrific together.\" \"Because of him! He was drunk! It's not like they were hit by a drunk driver, HE was the drunk driver!\" \"I know, I know. I'm not condoning his actions whatsoever but just try to put yourself in his shoes. I know you'd never put yourself in that situation but he unfortunately did and has to live with what he did to her.\" \"He could of killed her, Rachel.\" \"I know that and he knows that. Why don't we go get some coffee,\" Rachel said as she took Catherine's arm. \"I'm not leaving her alone with him\" Catherine said stubbornly. \"Okay, well I think it's best if you're not in there with him, so how about I stay and you go take a walk.\" \"Ten minutes\" Catherine replied, before reluctantly walking away. As she made her way through the halls of the hospital her anger began to turn into feelings of vulnerability. Why was Jackie in that car in the first place? She usually always had a driver to events. Why did she want to stay at the party if Rachel had left? Why did she leave with Tommy, was she planning on going home with him as pay back? There were so many unanswered questions but it most certainly wasn't the time to ask. For now she would just have to swallow it and try not to let it eat her up inside for Jackie's sake. When Catherine returned Tommy was saying his goodbyes to Jackie so she stood outside the door. As he was leaving he spotted Catherine and stopped. \"I know you don't want to see me but you'll never understand how truly sorry I am. I'll never forgive myself. I know you care about her but I do too.\" \"I don't just care about her, I'm in love with her Tommy. We're together. So I think she means slightly more to me than she means to you. Even if we weren't in love, there isn't a chance in hell I would've let her get into that car with me if I were you.\" \"Wow. I'm so sorry Catherine, I had no idea. She never told me about you two but now I understand why you hate me so much.\" \"Because I didn't want her to and being the selfless person that she is, she kept it quiet for my sake. Kind of like what she's doing with you right now. She's a good person, better than the two of us combined. So good that she cares more about your feelings than the fact that her body is completely broken because of you.\" \"I know. I'm sorry. For everything. I'm going to find a way to make this all up to her. I promise.\" Tommy said, before walking away. Catherine took a minute before going back into Jackie's room, not knowing how it was going to go. When she finally walked in, Jackie was sitting up with her oxygen mask back on. The sight of her all beat up was going to take some getting use to, that's for sure. Catherine flashed her a small smile and saw Jackie's cheeks raise behind her mask, returning the gesture. \"I've got some phone calls to make so I'll leave you two alone,\" Rachel said, knowing they needed some privacy. \"I didn't know what to bring you, so I brought a few different things. I wasn't sure what you'd be comfortable in\" Catherine said, as she placed the bag on Jackie's bed to show her. Jackie reached up to remove the oxygen mask to respond, when the nurse walked in. \"Someone's going to be a happy girl!\" The nurse beamed excitedly after taking Jackie's vitals. \"Your oxygen levels are up, you know what that means? We can trade in that bulky mask for a more slim nasal one. You won't even notice it now.\" When the nurse returned she had a toy-like machine with her. After switching out the oxygen she showed Jackie the machine. \"This is called an incentive spirometer. You're going to need to do this a few times a day to make sure your lungs stay clear. It's going to hurt at first, but you need to breathe into it as hard as you can to make the ball reach this line. Can you try it out for me?\" Jackie placed her mouth on the machine, finding the task silly, how hard could it be just to breathe. As soon as she blew out a breath she realized she overestimated her abilities. It felt like fire erupting out of her lungs into her throat, she spit out the mouth piece and coughed. \"I can't do that.\" \"Can you get that pillow off of the chair?\" The nurse asked Catherine. \"Here\" she said, grabbing the pillow from her. \"Place this against your chest as you do it. I'm sorry but you have to.\" Jackie tried again, breathing as hard as she could. Her lungs stinging and ribs throbbing and the ball hardly moved. \"Five more seconds\" the nurse instructed. Catherine rubbed her back, offering some support. They were the longest five seconds of her life and once the nurse left she was completely winded. Catherine spooned some ice chips into her mouth and once she started to feel better, Rachel came back into the room. \"Jackie you're all over the news\" Rachel said, as she clicked on the remote. They revealed everything, from paparazzi shots of Jackie and Tommy leaving the party, to Tommy's blood alcohol level and then finally footage of the wreckage. Jackie couldn't believe what she was seeing, the car was completely smashed on her side. Suddenly they showed the jaws of life cutting into car and Rachel switched the television off. \"You don't need to see that. I was on the phone with Matt, once you're feeling up to it the lawyers are going to need to come and see you to decide how to handle this all with Tommy.\" Jackie was exhausted, too many visitors and commotion today and now the pain was quickly setting back in. \"I don't want to talk about that right now,\" she fumbled for the remote but couldn't find it. \"What do you need?\" Catherine asked. \"Pain meds.\" \"I've got it.\" \"You look tired and it's getting late, I'll let you get some rest\" Rachel said before saying goodbye to the two of them. \"I'll be back tomorrow.\" As soon as Rachel left, the nurse entered and injected more pain medicine into Jackie's IV. \"Alright Honey, this will last you until your night nurse gets here. Do you want me to lean your bed back?\" Jackie nodded. When the nurse left there was an awkward silence between Catherine and her. Jackie closed her eyes and felt the medicine trail through her body, slowly making her feel like she was floating. The drugs were such a relief, instantly putting her into a better mood. Before opening her eyes she spoke, \"nothing happened between me and Tommy. I just want you to know that. It was just a ride.\" Catherine didn't speak so Jackie opened her eyes and turned towards her. \"I even hesitated before getting in the car because I was scared you would be mad.\" Catherine looked back at her, her eyes brows suddenly pressing together in the middle and her eyes began to form tears. \"Come here,\" Jackie whispered as she patted on the bed. Catherine got up and sat on the bed. Jackie carefully moved her hips and broken leg and scooted over, \"lay with me.\" \"I don't want to hurt you,\" Catherine said softly. \"I don't think I have any bones left to break\" Jackie laughed, \"and I'm so drugged up right now I can't feel a thing.\" Catherine laughed as tears continued to fall and Jackie tried her best to wipe them away one handed, but ended up poking her in the eye which made them laugh even more. \"Thank God I can't feel my ribs at the moment. Now go turn off the light and snuggle with me.\" Catherine smiled and got up to turn off the lights. When she returned she curled up next to Jackie as they both laid in the darkness, well as dark as a room can be with the glow of the hallway light seeping in. Jackie could hear Catherine sniffling and felt her tears fall on her hospital gown. \"Stop that. Why are you so sad, I'm okay.\" \"Because if I wouldn't have been so selfish, this would have never happened.\" \"This wasn't your fault. I don't blame you at all. I don't blame anyone.\" \"I'll always blame myself.\" \"Well you shouldn't. I should've left with Rachel and that's all there is to it. But I didn't and now I'm here, and you're here, and that's all that matters. Now can you scoot in a little closer? You're not going to break me.\" Catherine moved in a tiny bit closer and they both laid in silence, listening to the beeping of her machines. \"This is our most romantic date yet,\" Jackie whispered. Catherine laughed, \"I love you\" she said in one breath, effortlessly. \"I love you too.\" After a moment Jackie whispered again, interrupting the moment. \"And these drugs. I really love these drugs.\" Catherine laughed. Letting go of her regret for just that moment, to appreciate hearing Jackie's humor just 24 hours after thinking she would never even hear her voice again.[Chapter 34] Catherine heard whimpering before she opened her eyes. Jackie was moving restlessly beside her, tears running down her face. \"What's wrong?\" Catherine asked concernedly. \"It hurts,\" she moaned quietly. Catherine carefully got out of bed, worried that she hurt her. She knew it wasn't a good idea to get into bed with her. \"Did I do something? Why didn't you wake me?\" She asked, pressing the button for the nurse. \"No, the medicine is just wearing off. I didn't want to wake you, I know you haven't slept much.\" \"Jackie, you're not bothering me, I'm here to help.\" \"Please just call the nurse.\" Catherine could tell Jackie was trying her hardest to be brave in front of her. \"I did. Do you want ice?\" \"No.\" \"What hurts?\" \"Everything.\" She said, out of breath. It killed Catherine seeing her in so much pain and not being able to do anything about it. The nurse finally came in, one they hadn't met yet. \"What can I do for you?\" She asked. \"She's ready for her pain meds.\" The nurse checked her chart then looked up at the clock, \"she's not due for pain medication for another hour and a half.\" \"But she's in a lot of pain, isn't there anything you can do?\" Catherine insisted. \"I'm sorry but the earliest I can do is an hour.\" She walked over and checked Jackie's vitals, \"just try and get some sleep Honey, I'll make sure I'm back in time.\" Catherine looked down at Jackie who was now taking fast, shallow breaths and writhing in pain. \"What can I do?\" She asked heartbroken. \"I don't know\" Jackie cried. Catherine went into the bathroom, retrieved a washcloth and ran it under cool water. She came back out and placed it on Jackie's forehead. \"Try to control your breathing, I know it's hard but it'll help, trust me.\" Catherine held the washcloth on Jackie's head with one hand and softly ran her fingertips down Jackie's arm with the other. This seemed to work for a little while but Jackie couldn't stay strong any longer and began to moan in pain again, gripping the sheets. Catherine offered her hand, \"Squeeze it as hard as you want.\" Jackie took hold but hardly squeezed, that's just the type of person she was. \"You won't hurt me, do it.\" \"I don't want to\" she shouted, pulling her hand away. It was almost unreal that a few hours ago Jackie was laughing and joking while Catherine laid in bed with her, now she was in unbearable pain. Clearly the drugs had just been an illusion, in reality Jackie was significantly injured and it was going to be a long road to recovery. \"15 minutes\" Catherine said, looking up at the clock. \"You've got this.\" Jackie squeezed her eyes shut, her face wincing. She let go of Catherine's hand and placed her hand over her eyes. \"You don't have to be strong right now.\" \"It hurts so fucking bad\" she cried. \"It literally feels like someone is turning my body inside out. I just want to go home.\" \"I wish I could take it away.\" Jackie unexpectedly grabbed Catherine's arm, hard. \"Go get the nurse.\" \"You heard what she said-\" \"I don't care, get her please !\" Jackie said sternly, pressing her fingers into Catherine's arm. \"Okay, okay I'll see what I can do,\" Catherine pressed the button then went into the hall, rubbing her arm and noticing the imprints Jackie left. \"Clearly the pain was unmeasurable for her to resort to this.\" She saw the nurse coming down the hall and waved to her to come. \"I know you said an hour minimum but she literally can't handle it anymore. If you aren't going to do anything can you at least come talk to her? I don't have the heart to go back empty handed.\" The nurse followed Catherine back into Jackie's room. \"I know it hurts Honey but I literally cannot give you anything for another 15 minutes.\" \"PLEASE! I will sign whatever you need for you to give me something!\" Jackie cried. \"I'm sorry but it doesn't work that way. I promise you I will be back, I'll go get it ready now\" she said, as she walked out. \"Do you want the washcloth back on your forehead?\" \"No.\" Catherine cautiously went back to the bed and began rubbing her arm but Jackie pulled it away again, \"please don't touch me.\" \"Okay, I'm sorry.\" Jackie placed her arm back over her eyes and breathed deeply, they didn't speak until the nurse finally came back in. \"You made it!\" The nurse said cheerfully, but Jackie wasn't having it, she just wanted the medication pumped into her veins as soon as possible. After she watched it being injected into her IV, she closed her eyes, hoping it would kick in quickly. Once the pain reached a tolerable level she turned to Catherine, feeling embarrassed. When she looked over Catherine was staring down at her arm and rubbing it. \"Did I hurt you?\" The way she looked up at her, let Jackie know that she did but Catherine was trying to disguise it. \"No.\" \"Yes I did, I'm so sorry.\" \"You do not need to apologize, I can't even begin to imagine the amount of pain you're in. I just wish there was more I could do.\" \"You just being here is enough. I'm embarrassed. I shouldn't have acted that way.\" \"I would have been much worse\" Catherine smiled. \"Yeah, you would have\" Jackie laughed. \"Come back to bed?\" \"I don't think that's a good idea.\" \"I told you, you didn't hurt me. Come on... I know you're tired and I know that chair isn't comfortable.\" \"You need your rest, I'll be just fine here.\" The next morning, Catherine was sitting on Jackie's bed feeding her jello when Jackie's focus abruptly shifted towards the door. She looked like she had just seen a ghost. \"Well hello Jacqueline.\" Catherine looked back and saw a middle aged woman with blonde hair standing in the doorway. At first she thought it was Jackie's lawyer until Jackie spoke, \"Hi Mom.\" Her heart dropped, not knowing what to do she rose from the bed, \"I'll leave you two alone.\" \"No, stay.\" Catherine shot Jackie a look, the uneasiness causing her stomach to turn, she didn't even know if Jackie's mother knew who she was. \"How come I had to find out through the news that my only daughter was almost killed in a car accident?\" \"Well I've been a little preoccupied,\" Jackie said sharply, motioning to her crippled body. \"And Wade or your assistant couldn't have called?\" \"I'm neither one of those people so I can't answer for them.\" \"It's been three days, I think you could have called.\" \"We didn't exactly end on good terms.\" The hostility between the two of them made Catherine wish she was anywhere but there, trapped in the small hospital room with them. \"Jackie, that doesn't mean you're not still my daughter.\" Jackie didn't say anything, just stared at her mother. \"And who are you?\" she asked, finally acknowledging Catherine's presence. \"Catherine, it's nice to meet you\" she said, offering her hand. \"Catherine Stark?\" She looked at Jackie first then smiled hesitantly, \"Yes that's me.\" \"Well that explains why you didn't call.\" Jackie's mother failed to return Catherine's handshake as she shifted her gaze back to her daughter. \"If you're going to be rude you can go ahead and leave.\" Jackie responded. Catherine finally got up the nerve to excuse herself once she realized she was part of the issue. \"Jackie I'll be back later. I'm sure you both have a lot to talk about. It was really nice meeting you\" she said quickly, not waiting for a response she knew she wouldn't get. As soon as she got to the elevators she ran into Rachel. \"Oh, thank God.\" \"What's wrong?\" Rachel asked worriedly. \"Jackie's mother just arrived. She didn't seem too keen on me so I gave them some room, but will you go? I think Jackie needs some support and I'm clearly just making things worse.\" \"Oh God. We didn't call her\" Rachel said, covering her mouth with her hands, mortified. \"Yeah, she's not too happy.\" \"Okay, yeah. I'll take care of it.\" \"Thanks, can you let Jackie know I'll be back soon?\" \"No problem, wish me luck.\" \"You need it!\" Catherine smirked. Back in the hospital room, things weren't going any better between Jackie and her mom now that they were alone. \"Are you okay? You look awful.\" \"Thanks mom. You've always had a way with words,\" she said sarcastically. \"Oh stop it. Is it anything serious?\" \"Just a few broken bones and stitches.\" \"Knock, knock\" Rachel said, as she appeared at the door. \"Hey Rachel this is-\" \"Your mother\" she said, finishing Jackie's sentence. \"It's my pleasure, I'm Jackie's assistant.\" \"So you're the one who didn't call me.\" Rachel was taken aback by her remark. \"I apologize. Jackie's phone was ruined in the crash and things have just been so hectic. I called everyone's number I had.\" \"I should have been notified.\" \"I agree Mrs. Kirk, I'm very sorry.\" \"Could you give me a minute alone with my daughter?\" \"Actually I was just coming to tell Jackie that the lawyers would be here at 4 P.M.\" \"Well what do we have here a party?\" The nurse asked, as she entered the room. \"Jackie I'm sorry to interrupt but we need to take you down to Radiology to make sure everything is still looking good. The doctor is coming to check on you in a bit and asked we provided new X-Rays.\" \"Darn, did you hear that mom? I gotta go.\" \"I'll wait.\" When Catherine returned to the hospital, Jackie's room was dark and her eyes were closed. She cautiously entered and looked around, making sure her mother wasn't there. \"Don't worry, Rachel took my mom down to the cafeteria\" Jackie smiled, as she opened her eyes. \"I'm sorry, were you trying to sleep?\" \"No it's okay. Just waiting for the pain killers to do their thing, the doctor is going to be in soon anyway to check me.\" \"So how did things go with your mom?\" Catherine wasn't sure how else to bring it up other than being completely blunt. \"Not good. She started hounding on Rachel for not calling her, but then I was saved by the nurse who took me down to X-Ray. When I came back she was driving me crazy and my pain was increasing, so she finally agreed to go get a bite to eat with Rachel so I could rest.\" \"I'm sorry I left. I figured you two needed some space since you haven't talked in a while. She didn't seem too thrilled to see me though, I'm assuming she knows something about me considering her reaction.\" \"Hence why we haven't spoken in almost a year.\" Jackie revealed. \"What did you tell her?\" \"We had began getting closer for once in our lives and I confided in her, but she went ballistic. She says I'm just going through some weird phase in my life.\" \"Ah.\" Before they could go into it further, the doctor entered. \"Good Afternoon Ms. Kirk, how are you feeling?\" \"The pain meds are starting to kick in, so okay for now.\" \"That's understandable, you're going to be sore for a while.\" He began to unbandage the gauze around her head, \"the stitches seem to be healing nicely. Can you hit the lights?\" He asked the nurse. Once they were off he shined a flashlight into Jackie's eyes. \"Good. Are you still experiencing headaches? Dizziness?\" \"Yes.\" \"Nothing looks too concerning, your concussion shouldn't be anything to worry about. Now lets take a look at that shoulder. Your X-Rays looked promising as expected.\" Catherine watched as he removed the bandages and lowered Jackie's gown. The entire right side of her body was black and blue, stitches lining the upper part of her shoulder. Catherine had never seen such a sight in real life. He gently placed his fingers on Jackie's ribs and she winced. \"I know I'm sorry. Now, can you slowly lift your arm for me?\" The doctor asked, as he took hold of her elbow and shoulder. Jackie noticed the look on Catherine's face as she looked at her mangled body. Thoughts of self consciousness suddenly ran through her mind. Did Catherine still find her attractive? Would she be able to handle this? The tenderness she felt as the doctor poked her ribs brought her back to reality. She tried her hardest to raise her arm but it was seemingly impossible. \"That's okay, we expected this. With work it'll get back to where it was. Everything is really looking well for you so we need to start talking about discharging you. Now don't worry, we will give you the medication you need, but you can ride this out at the comfort of your own home until it's time for physical therapy.\" \"I just need to say something,\" Catherine chimed in. \"Her apartment is not ideal. She lives on the third floor and there is no elevator.\" \"That's why she'll be staying with us,\" Jackie's mother said, as she stormed back into the room.[Chapter 35] \"This is humiliating.\" \"You're my little baby!\" Rachel teased, as she played airplane with the spoonful of mashed potatoes she was feeding Jackie. \"I'm not eating if you continue to do that,\" Jackie protested. \"Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.\" Rachel surrendered, trying to wipe the amusement off of her face. \"Rachel what am I going to do? I can't survive living with my mother again, yet alone in this condition. I would literally be stuck there, relying on her for everything, like a child again.\" \"Well what do you want to do?\" \"Be with Catherine. But she hasn't said a word about it, maybe she doesn't want the responsibility of taking care of me. I don't want to be a burden.\" \"I highly doubt that. Why don't you just talk to her?\" \"Because I don't even know how we'd go about it. My apartment is impossible and I couldn't ask her to come stay out here that long regardless, she has Ethan.\" \"We'll figure out something, I promise\" Rachel said, placing her hand on Jackie's knee. \"Well it better be fast, I'm being discharged in two days.\" \"Look at you eating!\" Catherine said, as she entered the room. \"Thanks for letting me go take care of a few things, Rachel.\" \"You know, you guys don't have to monitor me 24-7. I'm not a baby.\" Jackie was quickly becoming annoyed with her lack of independence and the current situation that presented itself. \"Sure you are, you're what? 12?\" Catherine teased. Jackie flashed her a displeasing look. \"What, you're the only one allowed making age jokes?\" Catherine asked, coming over and kissing Jackie on the forehead before disappearing into the bathroom. \"Don't say a word to her about this\" Jackie warned Rachel. \"Did you eat?\" The nurse asked as she walked into the room. The constant traffic of people in and out was also getting to her. \"A little bit.\" \"Good, you're going to need your strength because we are getting you out of this bed.\" \"Today?\" Jackie asked excitedly, this was exactly what she needed given her current mood. \"Yes, the physical therapist is coming. Today we will just start you slow, getting up and taking a few steps to the bathroom. I'm going to go get your pain medication first, then we are going to remove some of these tubes.\" \"What's going on?\" Catherine asked, as she came out of the bathroom. \"I finally get to get out of this bed!\" Jackie beamed, however it was short lived. Her spirits instantly dropped as soon as her mother appeared at the door. \"The lawyers won't be here for a couple more hours\" she snapped. \"I can't just see my daughter?\" Her mother replied with a snarky tone. When the nurse came back, she warned Jackie that they were beginning to ween her off of her pain medication, and would be removing her IV to begin her on a pill regime. \"Don't worry, you will still be given ample amount of relief, it just won't make you so drowsy and isn't as potent.\" \"Good, we don't need her developing an addiction, she's strong enough to handle the pain anyway\" Jackie's mother chimed in. Catherine noticed Jackie flash a look at Rachel. She had seemed irritated since she returned from getting a bite to eat and wondered what the two of them had talked about while she was gone. \"Okay, I'm going to need to ask everyone to give us some privacy so I can remove some of these tubes,\" the nurse asked, after Jackie had swallowed her medication. To say outside in the hall was uncomfortable was an understatement. Catherine had no idea what to talk to Jackie's mother about, so instead Rachel tried to cut the tension and make small talk with her. When they were allowed back in the room, Rachel excused herself letting them know she would be back when the lawyers arrived. Catherine was nervous to be left alone with Jackie and her mother, so tried her best not to step on anyone's toes. The physical therapist arrived and greeted them all. \"We're going to start slow. Just to warn you, you may experience some dizziness and nausea from laying down for so long, it's not unusual. Now this is going to be a little tricky since you have a shoulder injury and leg injury on the same side of your body.\" He went to the hall and brought in a walker and crutches. \"I brought a few different options, a wheel chair is also on its way.\" \"I am not using a walker,\" Jackie scoffed. \"And I'd rather not use a wheelchair. I just really want to be independent.\" \"We want you to be too, but your health and safety come first so let's just see how things go. First things first, we need to teach you how to correctly get out of bed. I know it sounds silly but it's important so you don't harm yourself further.\" After he showed Jackie, he had her mother and Catherine try, which increased the tension. \"Okay, now we're going to try and stand. We're going to use the walker just to get you steady, alright?\" Jackie nodded. \"Can I have you ladies come stand on either side of her? For her injured shoulder, just place your hand on the middle of her back.\" Catherine walked to her injured side, not wanting to impose on Jackie's mother's motherly instincts, assuming she had any. When Jackie noticed she became disheartened, her theory of Catherine not wanting to help her mend was becoming more of a reality. Determined to do this, Jackie grabbed hold of the walker and tried to stand but was unable to, she felt incredibly weak. \"It's okay, take your time and try again\" the physical therapist said encouragingly. This time Jackie put forth everything she had in her and stood. \"Whoa, not so fast!\" He said cautiously. As soon as she was upright Jackie became extremely lightheaded. \"I need to sit,\" she whispered. \"Just stand in place for a moment, it should pass,\" he said. \"I'm going to pass out,\" Jackie warned. \"You're fine. Just do this, take a step\" Her mother insisted. \"No steps yet. She won't be able to use the walker with one hand, she will need a crutch but I just want to work on her balance right now. Can you two hold her on your own while I grab the wheel chair?\" \"Yes,\" her mother answered for them. \"Sit me down, I can't do this right now\" Jackie pled as the nausea began to set in. \"He's getting the chair, just wait a little longer,\" her mother replied. \"I'm serious, sit me down, I'm going to be sick.\" \"Okay,\" Catherine said softly, moving in front of Jackie to help her sit down. \"No, she needs to wait for the chair!\" Her mother argued. The physical therapist finally came back with the wheel chair, but Jackie couldn't wait a second more. \"She needs to sit, she said she's going to be sick.\" Catherine informed him. \"She's fine, lets get her in the chair,\" Jackie's mother cut in once again. As they were turning Jackie around to sit in the chair, she felt it coming and didn't have time to warn them. Then it happened. She got sick all down her gown. Catherine was holding on tightly making sure she wouldn't fall, as her mother quickly stepped away. \"Oh, for heavens sake\" she yelled. \"Get out!\" Jackie yelled at her mom. \"Jackie, I didn't-\" \"Get out!\" She yelled again, and with that her mom grabbed her purse and stormed out. \"Let's get you seated in the chair and I'll call the nurse to come clean you up.\" He said. \"We'll try again tomorrow but I'm glad we got you up, you did good.\" After he and Catherine carefully sat her down, he left to get the nurse. Jackie sat in the chair mortified, covered in her own vomit. This wasn't exactly going to win over Catherine or the idea of taking care of her. Feeling embarrassed and defeated she felt her throat tighten and her eyes burn, great just one more thing to add to the humiliation. She covered her eyes as she began to sob. Catherine leaned down and rubbed her back, \"hey, it's okay.\" \"Can you please leave me alone?\" \"No, I'm not going anywhere.\" \"Look at me, I'm repulsive. I don't want you to see me like this.\" \"Jackie, you don't have to be embarrassed, he said this was normal.\" \"Please just leave!\" She yelled. \"Oh Honey, you poor thing\" the nurse said as soon as she walked into the room. \"Let's get you cleaned up. We're going to need to redress that shoulder.\" Jackie sat in the wheel chair, being stripped and bathed by nurses, feeling completely degraded and worthless as tears streamed down her face. Catherine sat in the hall, after leaving unwillingly. She felt awful for Jackie and wished she hadn't been so embarrassed. It wasn't her fault, she kept telling them she needed to stop but her mother kept pushing her. When the nurses let her know they were finished, she reentered the room. Jackie was sitting up, her eyes glazed from crying and she was staring blankly. \"Is it okay for me to come back in?\" \"Sure\" Jackie responded, continuing to look down. \"Are you okay?\" Catherine asked softly. \"I just vomited on myself then was bathed and dressed by strangers. And I can't even stand on my own two feet. What do you think?\" Catherine sighed as she walked over and sat on the bed. Before she could say anything, Rachel, Jackie's mother, and who she assumed were the lawyers, knocked on the door. She excused herself thinking it wasn't appropriate for her to be there. What felt like an eternity later, she watched as everyone filed out, including Jackie's mother who failed to even look in her direction. Rachel was last, who gave her a concerning look as she came over. \"Everything okay?\" \"That poor girl. I don't know much about her and her mother's relationship but I can see why they're estranged. She seems pretty beat down, maybe you should go in and see her. I'm going to go talk to the doctors and see if I can help her in some way.\" Catherine wasn't sure what Rachel meant, but was more concerned with Jackie. When she walked into her room, Jackie's bed was down and she was looking away towards the window. She didn't know what to say, you can only ask someone if they're okay a certain number of times, so she decided just to be there for her. Walking to the other side of the bed, she sat down in the chair. \"Can I get you anything?\" \"Can you turn off the lights?\" Jackie asked, not looking away from the window. \"Sure.\" After she turned them off, Catherine could see the tears falling down Jackie's cheeks from the glow of the television, so moved closer and rubbed her hand until she fell asleep. The next morning, the physical therapist came back early. \"Are you ready for round 2?\" Jackie nodded reluctantly and Catherine was determined to make this a better experience to lift her spirits, thankfully her mother was not there. \"Yes she is!\" Catherine said as she came over and offered her support. \"It's just the two of us this time, I think we can manage.\" \"Alright, I like the positivity!\" He replied. \"You let us know if you need a break, okay?\" Jackie nodded again then stood slowly, Catherine trying her best not to rush her. \"You good?\" she asked, once Jackie was on her feet. \"Yeah, just give me a minute.\" After a few moments she was ready. \"Okay, want to try the crutch?\" He asked. Jackie nodded and he brought it out. She struggled a bit balancing herself on it but slowly and surely with their help, she made her way to the wheel chair and sat down. \"Great work! See I told you we'd get you there. It'll get easier once you're out and about.\" They practiced for a half of an hour, getting in and out of the wheel chair and bed and to the bathroom. Once her session was over, Jackie stayed in her wheel chair to get used to being upright. She was already looking happier and Catherine wanted it to stay that way so had an idea. \"I'll be back in a second, do not move from that chair\" she warned. When she returned a few minutes later, she was almost bursting at the seams in excitement, \"You wanna get out of here?\" \"What do you mean?\" Jackie asked confused. \"I just got permission from your nurse to take you for a ride.\" The smile on Jackie's face told her everything she needed to know and she was glad to see it surface after yesterday's awfulness. After strolling through the halls they made their way out into the hospital's garden and Catherine watched as Jackie breathed in the fresh air and sun. \"I feel like I've been in a cave.\" \"You have been, but you're being released tomorrow, you should be happy about that.\" She watched closely as Jackie's gaze shifted to the ground and noticed her struggling to swallow, as if she were choking down tears. \"Are you going back to Bloomington?\" Jackie asked timidly. \"Not until I know you're okay,\" Catherine replied, taking her hand. Jackie looked up and smiled weakly, the joy in her eyes beginning to fade. Catherine knew she didn't want to stay with her mother, but wasn't sure how she could help. One thing was for sure though, abandoning her was out of the question. After noticing the time, she realized they unfortunately had to get going. \"The nurse made me promise we'd be back by lunch time.\" Making their way back indoors and through the lobby, a sudden flash of camera's erupted. Photographers were lined up outside on the street, shouting and snapping pictures of them through the glass walls, \"there she is!\" They called out. Jackie covered her face and yelled at Catherine to hurry. The sight of them all outraged Catherine, the crowd had not been that immense the last time she had left. As they made their way through the hospital, people began to give them looks and whisper as they noticed Jackie. Catherine tried her hardest to get her back to her room as quickly as she could, but it was drawing more attention to them. When she finally got her into the elevator alone, she knelt in front of her and saw her trembling, still covering her face. It was then she knew she had to to do everything in her power to get Jackie out of Los Angeles.[Chapter 36] After making their way through the chaos and finally getting back to Jackie's room, they were greeted by her mother. \"What's wrong with you? Where have you been?\" She asked. Jackie was still physically upset, so Catherine decided to speak up for once. \"I took her to get some fresh air and the paparazzi spotted us as we were passing the lobby. It's complete mayhem out there and they're all after getting a shot of Jackie.\" \"Well what did you expect Jackie? This is the lifestyle you chose.\" \"I don't think she signed up to be almost killed in a car accident that she had no control over. She deserves some privacy as she mends.\" \"I beg to differ. She had control over getting in that car with a drunk.\" \"Do you hear yourself right now? Look at your daughter,\" Catherine said pointing to Jackie. \"Look at the condition she's in and look how upset she is.\" \"I do see her, and I see you. The question should be have you seen each other? What on earth does a professor ten years older want with her? Is it money you're after or the fame?\" \"You don't have any idea what you're talking about. You don't know me, you don't even know your daughter. I'm not getting into this though because all I care about right now is getting her better. Jackie I'll be back in a minute, I need to go take care of a couple of things.\" She made sure to kiss Jackie on the forehead before leaving, letting her mother know her opinions had no affect on her. When she got out into the hall, she took a deep breath before calling Rachel. \"I have an idea and I need your help.\" After talking with Jackie's doctors, Catherine's phone rang and her heart skipped a beat when she saw it was Rachel. She needed her plan to work, Jackie needed her plan to work. \"They agreed!\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Yep! They just faxed me the papers, I'll be there shortly.\" Catherine couldn't believe it actually worked. Everything that could go wrong, had in their relationship, and it was about time they caught a break. She couldn't get back to Jackie's room fast enough to tell her. When she entered the room, Jackie's mother was attempting to help her into bed but Jackie was arguing with her to stop, she was obviously hurting her. \"I've got this\" Catherine cut in, hurrying over and reaching her arm around Jackie. \"She's just being stubborn,\" her mother insisted. \"You're going to need to drop this attitude before coming home or it's going to be an even longer road to recovery.\" \"I need to talk to Jackie alone for a minute please.\" Catherine looked her straight into the eyes, letting her know she wasn't threatened by her. After acting bothered by the idea, her mother finally exited the room and Catherine sat on Jackie's bed. \"I need you to be completely honest with me.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jackie asked. \"Do you really want to go to stay at your mom's?\" \"I don't have a choice. My apartment-\" Catherine cut her off, \"Do you trust me?\" \"Of course, Catherine what ar-\" \"Come to Bloomington with me.\" She blurted out. Jackie just looked at her confused. \"I talked to your doctor, he said you're okay to fly, and Rachel spoke with Tommy's lawyers who are willing to pay for a private jet to take you to and from Bloomington as needed.\" Jackie's face lit up but then turned solemn again. \"Are you sure you want this? I don't want to be a burden, I know I'm a lot right now but I promise I'm going to push myself to-\" Before Jackie could babble on anymore, Catherine took her face in her hands and kissed her. Their kiss was interrupted when they heard Jackie's mother clear her throat from the doorway. \"Are you finished here?\" she asked, agitated. \"We have a lot of arrangements to make before tomorrow.\" Catherine looked at Jackie and smiled, \"I'll let you two talk.\" \"No, stay. Mom, I appreciate the offer but I've made other plans.\" \"What do you mean?\" Jackie looked at Catherine. \"Catherine's going to Bloomington tomorrow and I'm going with her.\" \"You can't be serious.\" \"I am.\" \"Jackie this is absurd. She can't take care of you, she's brainwashing you.\" \"She's been here with me every minute since I was admitted, she took care of me all week.\" \"Because no one called me! She's trying to take you away from me!\" \"Why, because she's the first person to show me what it really means to love someone?\" Jackie's mother just glared at her before softening her voice a little. \"You can't travel, you need to be close to doctors, and what about your rehabilitation? Put our issues aside and be reasonable for a minute.\" \"I've taken care of all of that\" Rachel said as she entered the room. \"You're in on this as well?\" Her mom said annoyingly. \"I'm supportive of whatever's in Jackie's best interest and right now, that's with Catherine in Bloomington. It's not good for her health to be in Los Angeles until this blows over.\" \"This is ridiculous. Jackie don't expect any help from me if this is what you choose.\" \"It is. I don't need your help, I haven't for a long time.\" Jackie's mother stared at her for a moment then looked around the room at each of them before leaving. \"I love you both more than you'll ever know, but how is this possible?\" Jackie asked. \"It wasn't hard. Tommy's lawyers leapt at the idea of getting you out of the public eye until you're healed. Them seeing you like this would only worsen Tommy's image.\" Rachel explained. \"Jeez, do I look that bad?\" Jackie asked, touching her face. \"No, you're beautiful. But seeing you bandaged up like this would break anyone's heart and want to crucify Tommy. Trust me, I know from first hand experience\" Catherine replied. The next morning, Jackie's doctor came in to go over her medicine regime and a list of referrals for doctors and physical therapists in Indiana. Jackie watched as Catherine paid close attention and couldn't help but smile. She would never be able to repay her for making such a sacrifice to help her. By mid afternoon Rachel had arrived with all of Jackie's belongings packed up, ready to go to Bloomington. Wanting to avoid the media, they were exited through a back door. Getting into their vehicle wasn't as difficult as she imagined, but the car ride was much worse. Every bump they hit in the road she felt throughout her entire body, despite taking her pain medication right before leaving. When they approached the airport they were driven right onto the Tarmac to their private jet. \"Fancy Neptune,\" Catherine winked. Before being rolled onto the plane Jackie hugged Rachel hard, thanking her for making this all possible. \"You call me if you need anything, and I mean anything. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Take care of our girl Catherine, and you call me if you need anything too.\" Catherine hugged Rachel as hard as Jackie did. \"You'll never know how much we appreciate this,\" Catherine whispered in her ear. \"Go on, go fly off into the sunset.\" Rachel teased. After loading Jackie onto the plane, Catherine gave her the medication her doctor supplied, a sedative that would help her sleep during the long flight so she wouldn't be so uncomfortable. Fortunately, the fancy jet had luxurious leather recliners to make the ride a little more tolerable. Catherine studied the medicine bottle and saw Jackie smiling. \"Medicine kicking in I assume?\" \"Yes\" Jackie giggled. \"Think I could get some of these for my fear of flying?\" Catherine joked. \"Take some,\" Jackie insisted. \"No way, I'm all you've got now. I've gotta stay sober.\" Jackie reached her handle across the aisle, \"thank you so much. I'll never be able to repay you.\" \"Repay me? This is supposed to be repaying you.\" \"For what?\" Jackie asked. \"How about this. How about we stop keeping score and just be happy for once.\" \"You got it,\" Jackie smiled. After taking off, Jackie slipped into a semi coma state of sleep, as Catherine watched on. She should take advantage of the opportunity to sleep considering the lack of it she's gotten since Jackie's accident, but the fear of being her sole care giver with everyone else across the country scared her more than she'd ever let Jackie know. Despite her fears, Catherine knew it would all be worth it and never wanted Jackie to be so far from her again.[Chapter 37] Jackie woke up when they were about thirty minutes from Bloomington. \"Looks like the drugs worked\" Catherine smiled. \"Looks like it,\" Jackie said, as she rubbed her eyes. Catherine saw her wince, she'd assumed she'd be in pain considering the time. \"Need some pain meds?\" \"Yes please.\" Catherine unbuckled her seat belt and went to grab the pills from her bag, holding on to the overhead compartments as the plane rattled. \"Looks like someone is becoming more comfortable on airplanes.\" Catherine smiled as she handed her the pills, \"Here you go. Missing the IV yet?\" \"Sadly yes, these pills have nothing on that morphine drip\" Jackie said, swallowing them down. \"Junkie\" Catherine teased. \"Good news is we should be landing soon.\" \"Did you sleep at all?\" Jackie asked, as she stretched out her leg and back. \"A little bit,\" Catherine lied. \"I bet you're as happy to get back here as I am. I bet you've been dreaming about that bed.\" Catherine just smiled at her, not wanting her to know how draining it's been living in that hospital. The last person she wanted any sympathy from was Jackie. Since it was a private jet, they would thankfully be landing directly in Bloomington, which would save them them the hour drive from Indianapolis. Due to the time difference, it was already 7:30 p.m. After landing, a car was waiting for them and the driver came aboard to help Jackie out of the plane. \"Welcome Miss Kirk, it's my honor to drive you to your destination this evening.\" \"What's your name?\" She asked. \"Curtis.\" \"Nice to meet you Curtis. The formality ends here, alright?\" He traded looks with Catherine and they both laughed. Once Jackie was seated in the car she looked around, \"who knew all it took to be treated like an A-lister was to survive a deadly car crash,\" Jackie commented. \"I'm glad to see your humor's back,\" Catherine laughed. Curtis went through the drive-thru for them since they hadn't eaten all day. McDonald's, Jackie's choice of course. Catherine hadn't dared to judge her considering she had eaten nothing but what was either provided through her feeding tube, or what the hospital offered for the last week. Once they arrived at Catherine's house, Curtis helped her get Jackie out of the car and inside. \"I think we're all good here, thanks Curtis!\" \"It's been my pleasure. Take care and let me know when you need me next.\" Catherine shut the door once he left and turned to Jackie. \"Home sweet home!\" She said, raising her arms dramatically. Jackie smiled and looked around before turning her direction to the sitting room. \"Is that for me?\" \"Ah, good it came! Yes, that's your bed,\" Catherine replied. \"Oh...\" Jackie said, suddenly looking distraught. \"Don't worry, I'll be camping out down here with you until we can get you back upstairs.\" Jackie didn't say anything for a minute then asked where Ethan was. \"He'll be here tomorrow. I thought we could use the night to settle in first, so had the dog sitter keep him at her house. Now let's eat, I know you're starving.\" She pushed Jackie's wheelchair into the kitchen and pulled her up against the table. Jackie insisted on trying to eat her hamburger herself, one-handed, which became quite the show. She moaned in ecstasy after taking her first bite, ketchup dripping down her mouth. Catherine couldn't help but laugh at the site. \"Don't judge me. This is the greatest moment of my life thus far,\" Jackie said through a mouthful of hamburger. Catherine attempted to wipe her face when she was finished but she grabbed the napkin from her. \"Did I get it all?\" She tried her hardest to keep a straight face, knowing Jackie's independence was crucial to her, but her entire face was still covered in ketchup. \"Almost. Can I?\" After wiping the remnants of her dinner off of her face, Catherine kissed her to make it seem more like a loving act than just her being her caregiver. Jackie smiled with a look of pride for the first time since the accident, any little act Catherine could do would go a long way she realized. It was definitely the little things. Once getting Jackie situated on the couch, making sure she was comfortable with plenty of pillows, Catherine handed her the remote and went upstairs to unpack and begin laundry. \"Catherine!\" she heard Jackie call from the living room, and went running. \"Oh I'm sorry, it's nothing serious, I just need help getting into my chair. I need to use the bathroom.\" After getting her to the bathroom and helping her stand and get her balance, she reached for her pants. \"No, don't. I can do it.\" \"Jackie I don't mind.\" \"No, please\" she begged. \"I promise I will be okay.\" Catherine looked at her reluctantly, but agreed after seeing the desperation in her eyes. \"Fine, but I'll be right outside.\" Several minutes later, Catherine started to become concerned and knocked on the door. \"Jackie, are you okay in there?\" \"Yeah just a minute!\" She called out, her voice breaking. \"Are you okay, what's wrong?\" \"Nothing, just give me a minute please!\" Jackie was inside the bathroom, her sling off and shirt lifted, staring at herself in the mirror. Although she had been up using the hospital's bathroom for the last couple of days, there was always a nurse in there with her so she was always rushing to get out, not having the time to look at herself. At first she started with her face, touching the disfigurement of it, she could hardly see her eyes. That's when she became curious about the rest of her body and slowly lifted up her sling and shirt. Catherine called into her and she could tell she was catching on, so quickly locked the door. \"Jackie, did you just lock the door?\" Catherine asked, jiggling the door handle. \"Jackie come on, don't play games right now.\" \"Just give me a minute!\" She called out again. \"Jackie open the door, I'm not messing around.\" She was silent inside the bathroom. \"I have a key, don't make me go get it.\" \"Catherine Please! Just leave me alone for a minute!\" As much as she wanted Jackie to have the independence she longed for, she was far too injured to give her this much freedom right away. Catherine searched through the desk drawer and found the key, running back to the bathroom. \"Jackie, I'm coming in.\" She slid the key through the lock and unlocked it, slowly turning the handle and opening the door. Jackie was wiping her eyes with her good hand and her shirt and sling we're both lifted above her shoulder. \"What's wrong?\" Catherine asked worriedly. Jackie pinched the inside corners of her eyes, trying to stop the tears and shook her head no. \"Come here, sit down\" Catherine said, as she closed the toilet seat and helped her sit. She knelt in front of her and carefully pulled her shirt back down over her shoulder and body, trying not to touch her bruised ribs. After it was in place, she slowly put her arm back into the sling. \"What's wrong, was something hurting?\" \"No\" Jackie said quietly, keeping her head down. \"Then what was it? Do you want me to help you with a bath?\" Jackie swallowed hard and wiped another tear from her eye, not responding. \"What is it, let me help you\" Catherine said, as she placed her hands on Jackie's knees. \"It's nothing, I was just looking at myself.\" Catherine was relieved nothing was wrong but then realized it was probably the first time Jackie saw the extent of her injuries. \"Are you okay? I know it's probably scary, but you're going to return to normal in no time. You've already made so much progress.\" \"I don't know how you still look at me, let alone kiss me every day\" Jackie said as she placed her hand back over her eyes. \"Stand up,\" Catherine replied, putting her arm around Jackie. \"Come on.\" Once Jackie was to her feet she balanced her in front of the mirror and stood behind her, but Jackie wouldn't look in the mirror. \"Look in the mirror.\" After a few moments she finally did, but did so self consciously. \"You're alive. They literally cut you out of a car after it wrapped around a telephone pole, and you're alive. Not only that but it was one week ago and here you are standing and talking. Look at your eyes.\" \"They're swollen and disgusting.\" \"No, look closely at your eyes,\" Catherine instructed. \"Are they the same eyes you've seen every day in the mirror for the last 23 years?\" \"Yeah,\" she replied softly. \"That's all I see when I look at you. I was so afraid when I first saw you lying in that hospital bed, but the first time I saw you open your eyes I was overcome with happiness. You're still you, and after all of this you'll be an even stronger version of you.\" Jackie smiled a tiny bit. \"Was that a smile? Don't do it, don't you smile\" Catherine teased, copying Jackie's technique of getting people out of their head. \"You're gorgeous to me no matter how you look, because all I see is your eyes and heart. The only things that matter. And I hope you're prepared for how hard I'm going to hug you once these ribs and shoulder heal,\" she smiled. Jackie dropped the sad demeanor and let a small laugh slip out. \"Was that a smile and a laugh?\" Jackie looked at her through the mirror and gave her a big smile. \"That's more like it. Come on, lets dope you up and get to bed, it's been a long week.\" After she got Jackie situated in her fancy bed, she asked if she was comfortable. Jackie nodded. \"Are you sure? I can get more pillows.\" \"Catherine I'm fine, come lay with me.\" \"Okay\" she smiled, before turning off the lights and crawling into bed with her. \"Jackie?\" She whispered. \"Hm?\" she replied, not opening her eyes. \"Are you happy?\" \"Mmhmm\" she murmured before falling asleep. Catherine spent the next thirty minutes just staring at Jackie's face and appreciating every single breath she took, hoping Jackie would learn to as well.[Chapter 38] The feelings overcome her once more, relief and happiness like she had never experienced before. Her body relaxed, the pain fading as the drugs settled in. The small things that were creating so much gratitude now; pillows propped up around her, wearing her own clothes and most importantly, Catherine and Ethan on either side of her supplying her unconditional love. Despite her physical ailments, Jackie was extraordinarily happy in that moment. Doing absolutely nothing, yet having everything she had ever wanted right there on that couch. That first week proved to be a learning process. As happy as Catherine was to be home, transitioning into the role of Jackie's sole care provider proved to more strenuous than she had ever imagined. Between keeping up with pill regimes and the spirometer, being Jackie's physical crutch, cooking, and keeping her comfortable, Catherine was left with little time for her own needs. On top of it all, Jackie was still waking up in the middle of the night in pain, and the couch was beginning to run its course on Catherine's back. She yearned for a good nights sleep up in her own bed considering it had been weeks. She was drinking multiple cups of coffee a day just to get by which was unusual for her, and her body was beginning to punish her. Keeping up her cheerful demeanor to keep Jackie's spirits high was an obstacle all in itself, but she was managing. She had to, she was to blame for this all. To top it off, she currently had awoken with a headache that was only increasing in pain as the day went on. Jackie looked over at Catherine as she reveled in her happiness, but the sunlight streaming in through the windows revealed a different sight, one that was hard to see. Catherine's eye lids drooped before finally closing as she rubbed the bridge between them. Where her eyelashes ended, dark deep circles began and below them, puffy bags billowed from the tops of her cheeks. When she opened her eyes, they showed a tint of red and no longer were as big and vibrant, so full of life, as they usually were. Jackie suddenly felt an extreme sense of guilt. Catherine had been at her every beckoned call around the clock for two weeks, and it just now became apparent to her that it was slowly draining ever ounce of life from her. Of course it was. How was she just now seeing this? Jackie watched as she blinked her eyes a few times, trying to wake herself up, before looking at the clock and beginning to stand. \"Where are you going?\" Jackie asked. \"To fix dinner,\" Catherine smiled. Her smile looked so genuine it could deceive anyone. Obviously, since she had Jackie convinced, but that was the end of it. Now Jackie saw, really saw her. \"Sit back down,\" she said as she patted the couch. \"Let's just order pizza tonight.\" \"That sounds wonderful actually\" Catherine sighed. \"I'll go order. Do you need anything from the kitchen?\" \"No, I'm fine.\" \"Okay\" Catherine smiled, as she began to walk away. \"Catherine?\" \"Yes?\" She asked, turning around. \"Are you alright?\" Jackie asked compassionately. \"Yeah, why wouldn't I be?\" she replied, confused. \"You look off,\" after two weeks of being told how terrible she looked, Jackie learned the appropriate way of asking someone who obviously wasn't feeling up to par, how they were feeling. \"I'm okay, just have a headache. I'm going to go take some aspirin and I'll be good as new,\" she smiled. When Catherine got upstairs she looked at herself in the mirror, no wonder Jackie said something, she looked absolutely terrible. After swallowing a few aspirin, she splashed some cold water on her face hoping to look rejuvenated. As she made her way back downstairs she glanced at her bed, dying to collapse in it. The food and aspirin dulled her headache and Jackie called it an early night, so she was thrilled to be able to squeeze in a decent amount of sleep before having to give Jackie her meds. Jackie woke up in excruciating pain per usual, her leg throbbing, her shoulder piercing. It was 2:30 A.M. and Catherine was sound asleep on the couch. Wanting to give her the night off, she tried lifting herself. The pain in her shoulder tearing through her arm as she moved, biting down on her lip to prevent from making any noise, she finally sat up and carefully swung her casted leg over the bed, bringing the other with it. She reached for her crutch that was resting against the wall almost knocking it over, she froze and glanced at Catherine but she didn't even stir. She extended her arm as far as she could, leaning forward, at last she grabbed hold of it and carefully tilted it back towards her. This was the first time she didn't have anyone helping her stand, so she took a minute to prepare herself. Grabbing the crutch she held tightly to it and put all of her weight on her left leg. Biting down on her lip even harder to subdue the pain that felt like lightning bolts flashing through her body. Slowly and surely she hobbled her way into the kitchen and spotted her medication on the counter. The pain was unbearable and it was taking every ounce of her not to make a peep the last few feet. Once she had the pills in hand, she struggled balancing on the crutch while trying to open the bottle. Frustrated, she attempted to use her teeth. When that didn't work she squeezed the bottle as tightly as she could, sending more pain up her shoulder, and used her good arm to twist the child proof cap. She felt it click but the relief didn't last long. Her eagerness caused her to lose grip on the bottle, sending every single pill scattering across the kitchen floor. \"Fucking perfect!\" She whispered. While trying to carefully get to the floor, she dropped her crutch, causing both her and it, to slam to the floor. She let out a shriek before covering her mouth one handed, trying to smother her cries. Catherine jumped up from her deep sleep, she looked over and saw Jackie missing from her bed and ran towards the noise. From the living room Catherine could see Jackie on the kitchen floor. \"Jackie!\" she yelled as she rushed into the kitchen. \"What happened, are you okay?!\" She began to put her arms around her to help get her up but Jackie cried out, \"no! Please just get me pills first.\" Catherine hurried to the sink and got a glass of water as Jackie grabbed the closest pills from the floor. \"Are you hurt?\" Catherine asked, closely studying her body for any indications. \"I don't think so, just give me a minute,\" Jackie said, concentrating on her breathing. Catherine sat next to her on the floor, worried and unsure of what to do. Should she take her to the hospital? As Jackie took her time to recover from the fall, Catherine began picking up the pills. \"Can we get you up off of the floor yet?\" \"Yeah\" Jackie said quietly. Catherine helped her stand but as they slowly began to walk, Jackie asked to stop at the table and sit first. \"Let me get the wheelchair.\" When Catherine returned she sat next to Jackie. \"What were you doing in here?\" \"I needed my pills.\" \"Then why didn't you wake me?\" \"I wanted to give you a night off\" Jackie said softly. \"It was just a headache, I'm fine,\" she insisted. \"No you're not. I'm a lot to handle, I know that.\" \"You're not-\" \" Catherine . Yes I am.\" Jackie stated matter of factly, looking into her eyes. \"I'm sorry it took me until today to see you.\" \"You could have really hurt yourself. Promise me you won't do that again,\" Catherine said, deflecting her statement. That was the beginning of a change. From then on, Jackie made Catherine lighten the load she was carrying and fight her urge to do everything for her. To compromise, Catherine would leave two pain pills and a glass of water by Jackie's bed every night, so she would no longer need to get up with her. As much as she wanted her bed, she just couldn't risk leaving Jackie alone downstairs, especially after the stunt she pulled. She liked being close to her anyway. In a few days they would be going back to California for a check up and hopefully would receive good news. In the meantime, the extra sleep was doing wonders for Catherine. Also to her surprise, she received a phone call from Stanford asking to come for a second interview, which she was able to arrange around Jackie's appointment. Once getting back to California, they were able to make it to the hospital unnoticed, a smiling Rachel meeting them there. \"You look so good! And happy!\" She said, hugging Jackie. \"I am, thanks to Catherine.\" Catherine smiled down at her before giving Rachel a hug. The doctor said Jackie was healing nicely, no complications and he signed her off to begin physical therapy. \"How soon until I get this cast off?\" She asked, knocking on her leg. \"A couple more weeks unfortunately, I'll give you a referral in Bloomington so you won't need to come back just for that.\" Jackie was not pleased with his response. Rachel booked a hotel room for them and would be staying with Jackie while Catherine went to Stanford for her interview. After giving her detailed instructions, Catherine hugged Jackie goodbye for the first time since her accident, hesitant to leave her. \"Break a leg!\" Jackie shouted, as Catherine was walking out. \"Probably not the best thing to say right now\" Rachel said, as she looked at Jackie's cast. Catherine laughed, \"don't have too much fun without me girls, and don't let that one pull a fast one on you Rachel\" she warned, pointing to Jackie. Jackie dropped her mouth in offense, \"Me? Never !\" Catherine just shot her a wink before heading off to the airport. Once checking in at Stanford, Catherine sprawled out on the King sized bed she had to herself. The first bed she'd laid in, in 3 weeks. She turned off the light, eager to enjoy it and the eight hours of restful, uninterrupted sleep she would be able to get not having to worry about Jackie, but instead something happened. Something she hadn't planned. She opened her eyes, suddenly missing the close proximity to Jackie and the luxury of knowing she was okay. Catherine reached for her phone and texted her just to check in, \"How are you doing?\" Jackie laughed when she saw the message light up across her phone. \"What's so funny?\" Rachel asked. \"Catherine's already worried about me\" she said, lifting her phone and showing her the screen. \"Aw, she loves you,\" Rachel teased. Jackie just smiled and wrote Catherine back. \"I'm fine, stop worrying ;) I'm in good hands.\" \"I know you are, don't hesitate to call. Promise?\" \"Promise. Enjoy your vacation from me :) and good luck tomorrow. Call me after.\" Even though they had been joking, calling this Catherine's vacation, she hoped Jackie didn't think any part of that was true. \"I miss you Porcupine.\" \"I miss you too, now get some sleep!\" \"So how has it been back in Bloomington? Everything you imagined it to be?\" Rachel asked. \"Yes, and no. Yes it's been great, but I'm so sick of being this way and having to rely on Catherine so much. I know it's beating her down.\" \"Honestly, it's probably helping her though. I don't think you realize how guilty she felt about this all. It tore her up inside and probably still does. Being able to help you heal is most likely helping her heal as well.\" \"The last thing I want is our relationship to turn into more of a patient/nurse scenario out of guilt, rather than a genuine one.\" \"That's not what I meant. She loves you so much, I can see it and could see it before you guys even told me. She didn't leave your bedside the entire time you were here and it wasn't based off of guilt, she just loved you so much she couldn't bare to leave you for even a second.\" Jackie just smiled, \"yeah you're right. I've just been feeling a little insecure lately and can't wait to get back to my old self.\" The next day while waiting for Catherine to return to Los Angeles, Jackie asked Rachel if they could stop by her apartment to get a few things. \"I can't get you up those steps.\" \"I know, I can wait in the car. Please !\" After convincing Rachel, she handed her a list of things and there whereabouts. \"I'll be back as soon as I can,\" Rachel said before disappearing into Jackie's apartment building, leaving her alone in the car. Jackie stared out the window, dreaming about the cappuccinos they were going to get at her favorite coffee shop down the street, when she spotted him. He was looking closely at her in the slyest way possible, before slowly reaching for what looked like a camera. Jackie quickly looked down, hoping she was just being paranoid. \"Jacqueline Kirk?\" She heard through the glass. Nope. Definitely not being paranoid. Not even bothering to look up, she dialed Rachel. Suddenly two more men showed up and they all began shouting at her. \"Jacqueline how are you? Are you pressing charges against Tommy? Have you talked to him?\" \"Rachel get down here the paparazzi are here.\" \"Shit, okay I have a couple more things to grab.\" \"Forget it, just get down here please!\" \"Jacqueline how is your recovery going?\" She didn't answer, just kept her head down and covered her face as she saw the flashes reflecting off of the windows. She finally heard Rachel's voice, yelling at them as she hurried to the car. \"Jacqueline! How does it feel to single handedly destroy Tommy's career?!\" \"Those fucking idiots! Don't you listen to them Jackie!\" Rachel sped off hoping to lose them before they reached their cars, but they caught up to them. She tried her best to weave between traffic but they stayed on her tail. \"Jesus they're even more relentless since you've been missing so long, you're still a hot topic here.\" Jackie's eyes were covered but she could feel the speed of the car. \"Rachel slow down\" she whispered. \"You know a picture of you would go for thousands I bet\" she said, ignoring her. \"Rachel please slow down,\" she repeated, losing her breath as her heartbeat increased. \"Jacks, if I do we'll lead them straight back to the hotel\" she replied, staring out her rear view mirror as she continued changing lanes. \"Rachel! Please just slow the fuck down!\" She yelled. Rachel did what was asked almost immediately. \"I'm sorry. Are you okay? I don't know what to do Jackie.\" Jackie sat there hysterical, unable to breathe so Rachel called Wade and told her the predicament they were in. After pulling into his building, security met them in a garage and took them up to his office where Jackie sat quietly. Catherine saw Rachel's number pop up and panicked, considering what happened the last time she called. \"Rachel, is everything okay?\" \"Not really-But don't worry! I took Jackie to her apartment, she wanted me to grab a few things and while she waited in the car, the paparazzi spotted her. They followed us and Jackie freaked out so we're at Wade's now because I couldn't lose them.\" Catherine made Rachel give the phone to Jackie and even though she assured her she was fine, she could tell she wasn't. A couple hours later when she landed in Los Angeles, she hurried to meet her. Unable to get Jackie back to the hotel, Rachel went with security to gather their belongings as they snuck Jackie to the airport. Once there, Rachel met Catherine and led her to a private room they were able to keep Jackie in until she arrived. \"She was really upset, I've never seen her like that before. I think it was a panic attack, she couldn't breathe.\" When Catherine entered the room she saw Jackie sitting in her wheel chair. \"Hey, are you okay?\" She asked, as she hugged her and kissed her forehead. \"Yeah, just get me out of here.\" After returning to Bloomington, things didn't go back to the way they were. Jackie began seeming distant and her humor lessened. She began physical therapy on her shoulder which left her tired and irritable, but Catherine knew it was deeper than that. One day when they were on their way home from therapy, a car pulled out in front of them almost causing Catherine to wreck. She laid on her horn, cussing them out. Once her anger ceased she glanced at Jackie and saw her breathing heavily but Jackie just credited her response to the shock of it. Back home when they were eating dinner, Catherine decided to try to talk to Jackie about it since it seemed as though she was struggling with something internally. \"I'm sorry about earlier.\" \"About what?\" Jackie asked confused. \"In the car.\" \"It wasn't your fault, that guy cut you off.\" \"I know but I could have handled it better.\" Jackie just blew it off like it wasn't a big deal and continued to eat. \"Was that like what happened in LA?\" She asked bluntly. \"What do you mean?\" \"With the paparazzi?\" \"Sorta, just their typical bullshit.\" \"You know, the doctor said you would probably start to remember bits and pieces about the accident once some time had passed.\" Jackie just stared at her fork before putting it down. \"I'm really tired from today, I think I'm going to go lay down.\" \"Okay, do you need help?\" \"No, I've got it. Thanks for dinner it was great,\" she said before kissing Catherine on the cheek. Jackie slowly made her way into the living room. She knew she wouldn't be able to hide her feelings for long, Catherine was starting to catch on. LA had been a disaster. Between the paparazzi scare and Wade breaking the news to her that she didn't get the part in the movie, she was beginning to feel more lost than she ever had. It seemed as though her struggle of finding a place where she belonged was becoming a constant. She left high school because she was treated as an outcast, left LA because she was lost without Mark, left Bloomington because everyone constantly pointed out the fact that she didn't belong and now, when she finally felt at home in LA again, she was being shut out once more. The last thing she ever imagined was the media blaming her for Tommy's mistake, and as much as she didn't originally want the role, it now made her feel empty knowing it wasn't hers. She was desperately trying to grasp onto something that would make her feel whole again, but she found herself left with nothing. Except for Catherine that is. But after seeing the affect she had on her, she was trying her best not to drag her down into this hole with her, leaving her no other choice than to distance herself from her. Finally something positive. A few days later, Jackie's cast was removed and was replaced with a temporary walking one. With her spirits raised, they stopped by the store to get some celebratory foods. \"I'm going to go grab a few things\" Jackie said, before parting ways with Catherine. As she was was making her way down an aisle, she stopped in her tracks when she spotted none other than Sandy standing in front of her. \"Jackie?\" She asked hesitantly, confused to see her there. \"Hi Sandy,\" Jackie smiled. \"How are you?\" She asked before looking at her shoulder and crutch. \"I heard about your accident.\" \"Yeah...\" Jackie replied. \"I'm getting there, how are you?\" \"I'm good, just about to start junior year. Are you coming back to school?\" Obviously that would explain her presence in Bloomington. \"Oh, uhh... no. I'm just here until I get better. I needed to get away from Hollywood for a bit.\" As Jackie was in the middle of explaining, Catherine walked up behind her. \"Hey do you want cookie dough or chocolate fudge-\" Catherine stopped as soon as she saw Sandy. \"Oh, sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. I'll meet you up front okay?\" \"Okay,\" Jackie nodded before turning her attention back to Sandy, who was staring at her in shock. Jackie smiled uncomfortably as Sandy stayed silent. Obviously seeing her with the infamous Professor Stark took her by surprise. \"Well I better get going, it was good seeing you\" she said, before beginning to hobble away. \"I'm sorry,\" Sandy finally blurted out. \"I had no idea you two were actually-\" \"It's okay,\" Jackie interrupted with a smile. \"You couldn't have known.\" When Jackie got to the front of the store, Catherine looked at her suspiciously. \"Everything okay?\" She nodded. \"Well that was interesting\" Catherine said, as soon as they got into the car. \"I almost grabbed some frozen peas from the freezer section. I don't see a black eye or bloody nose so I assume all went well?\" Jackie laughed, \"I'd say so. You should've seen her face when she saw you. She even apologized once the shock wore off.\" \" Really ?\" \"Yup. Guess she thought I was just another notch in your bedpost.\" Later that evening, they were preparing to get Jackie upstairs for the first time. Catherine was thrilled, Jackie was in a good mood all day and now they got to finally sleep in something other than a hospital bed or piece of furniture. Jackie was equally as thrilled, having her leg casted for over a month, she wanted nothing more than to soak her leg in the bathtub. Jackie grabbed hold of the railing as Catherine stood behind her to keep her balanced, also prepared to keep her from falling backwards down the giant staircase. Before even reaching the halfway point, Jackie couldn't take it anymore. The added stress on her stiff and weak leg muscles proved to be too much. \"I can't do this, take me back down.\" \"Jackie we're half there, just-\" \"Catherine I can't!\" She cried. \"Just stand here for a second and take a break, you're so close.\" Jackie took a minute before continuing on. After the first step she stopped again, \"I can't!\" \"Yes you can. Come on, you can do this.\" She screamed at every step. \"That's fine, let it out, just keep going.\" When she got to the top, Catherine handed her the crutch. Jackie looked at Catherine's door, it was still so far away. \"I hate you so much right now\" she muttered, feeling defeated. Catherine smiled. \"You're going to take that back the moment you get into that tub and lay on that bed.\" As soon as they reached the bed, Jackie collapsed onto it while Catherine went to run the bath water for her. She must have fallen asleep because when she awoke, Catherine was kissing her neck, straddled on top of her. Jackie opened her eyes and smiled. \"What did I tell you\" Catherine teased, as she helped her sit up and walk to the bathroom. She sat her down on the side of the tub and knelt in front of her, gently loosening the strap of her sling before carefully lifting it up over her head and removing her arm from it. \"Are you okay?\" Jackie nodded. She then removed her walking cast and pants as Jackie began removing her shirt, wincing as she tried getting her shoulder through. \"Careful\" Catherine spoke quietly, as she took control and slowly removed her shirt. As soon as it was over Jackie's head she looked down at her scar and covered it with her hand self consciously. Catherine took her hand and kissed it as she looked at her and smiled. She then gently ran her finger tip above the scar before leaning in and kissing it softly. Jackie looked back at her, full of emotion and Catherine took her face in her hands, kissing her. They hadn't kissed like that since before the accident, since before their fight. Catherine stopped and pressed her forehead against Jackie's, knowing she had to contain herself. \"The water is going to get cold,\" she whispered. Jackie nodded, her forehead still pressed against Catherine's. After getting in the bath, Catherine left her there to relax. \"Don't, under any circumstance, fall asleep\" she warned, before smiling and leaving Jackie alone. When she was finished, Catherine helped her up and wrapped her in a robe, sitting her on the bed as she brought fresh clothes. \"That one\" Jackie pointed, choosing Catherine's lacrosse shirt. \"How did I know,\" she teased. After getting her arm adjusted in the shirt she flashed her a look, \"still hate me?\" \"Mmhmm...\" Jackie mumbled, over-embellishing her nods. \"Oh really? What about now...\" Catherine said, kissing her on the cheek. \"Mmhmm\" Jackie mumbled once more. Catherine smiled before kissing her on the neck, \"And now?\" Jackie just smiled as Catherine slowly leaned her back on the bed. Without hardly even touching her, Jackie winced \"ow!\" \"What? Are you okay? Did I hurt you?\" \"I'm just sore, maybe I should take my pain pills before this goes any further.\" \"Yeah, of course\" Catherine said, as she carefully got off from on top of her. \"I'll be back in a sec,\" she winked. When she returned to the room not even five minutes later, she found Jackie lying in bed sound asleep. \" Jackie \" she whispered smiling, rubbing her arm. No response. \"Poor thing.\" After placing the pills on the night stand, Catherine pulled the covers up over her and kissed her on the forehead before turning off the lights and crawling in next to her. Once she felt Catherine finally drift off to sleep, Jackie opened her eyes and stared out into the darkness.[Chapter 39] Jackie stared up at the ceiling, watching the reflections of light casting from the windows scatter across it. She'd been doing so for a good portion of the morning, after a night of minimal sleep. Catherine's phone unexpectedly began to ring, causing her to jump. Catherine grabbed it still half asleep, but quickly got up when she looked at the screen. \"This is Catherine,\" she spoke professionally. Jackie watched her as she paced around the room, trying to figure out who was on the other end of the line. It was definitely a university offering her a job, but which? \"Again, thank you so much and you will be hearing from me shortly!\" She hung up the phone and spun around, smiling coyly. \"You got a job\" Jackie stated, raising her eyebrows. \"I did.\" She smiled. \"So who was it?\" \"UCLA.\" Jackie flashed her a giant smile, at least now she knew she'd have Catherine in LA. \"When do you start?!\" \"I didn't accept yet, they're going to email me the offer to look over and I have a couple of weeks to decide. Hopefully I hear from Stanford before then.\" \"What about Berkeley?\" \"I didn't get it.\" \"I'm sorry, when did that happen?\" \"When you were in the hospital. It's no big deal, Stanford and UCLA were always my top two anyway. I'm just relieved to know I have something now. What a way to start the day. I had the best nights sleep and I got to wake up to that... And you ,\" she smiled. \"How did you sleep?\" \"Great\" Jackie responded, lying through her smile. \"I figured as much since you fell asleep on me last night.\" \"I'm sorry, I guess the steps wore me out.\" Another lie. \"I'm sure the warm bath didn't help either.\" After getting Jackie back downstairs, Catherine asked if she minded if she went on a run after breakfast. \"I'm just feeling really energized and want to take advantage of it,\" she explained, cheerfully. \"Yeah, no problem. I can entertain myself.\" When Catherine was on her run, Jackie sat on the couch feeling worthless. As happy as she was for Catherine, it just reminded her of her own career in shambles, not to mention her body. She glanced over at the liquor cart and debated for a minute before making her way over to it and drinking straight from the bottle of scotch. Not wanting Catherine to know, she brushed her teeth directly after and hoped she didn't keep a close eye on the amount in the bottles. She wasn't sure if it was because she hadn't drank in almost two month or if it was the medication, but she became light headed almost instantly. Another night went by with Jackie able to avoid Catherine's advances, this time claiming to suffer from a headache, which wasn't completely false given the scotch. Still unable to sleep, she silently slipped out of bed and went downstairs. She took some swigs of vodka before retreating to the couch, careful to switch things up so Catherine was less likely to catch on. Too nervous to turn on the television and wake her, she regrettably spent the next hour scouring through the tabloid articles on her. The paparazzi's comment to her was enough to drive her deeper into this hole, but now reading what the rest of the world thought of her sank her beyond saving. \"Jackie\" Catherine said, shaking her. She slowly opened her eyes, the warm sun just beginning to rise through the large windows in the living room. \"What's wrong? Why did you sleep down here?\" Her headache a reminder of her late night escapade, she nervously looked around, hoping she put the liquor bottle back. Relief set in when she saw it sitting on the cart. \"I couldn't sleep.\" \"Is it your head still?\" She asked. Jackie felt the nausea abruptly set in and quickly went to the bathroom. \"Are you okay? Maybe we should go see the doctor,\" Catherine spoke nervously outside the door. \"No, I'm fine. It's just a migraine\" Jackie said, opening it. \"It might be related to your concussion, I think we should go just to be safe.\" \"Catherine that was almost two months ago, I'm fine. It's just being out here in the Midwest, I use to get them all the time when I lived here.\" Jackie was impressed with her own quick thinking. Later that day while they were eating lunch, Catherine received yet another phone call. Jackie's stomach knotted. As soon as Catherine began smiling she knew it was a done deal. When she hung up, the biggest smile Jackie had ever seen expanded across her face. \"Stanford?\" She didn't say anything, just nodded her head yes with the giant smile still plastered on her face. Jackie got up and hugged her as Catherine squealed in happiness, hiding her own disappointment. \"I'm so happy for you, you deserve this.\" As Catherine was busy reading over both contracts that night, Jackie slipped outside to the backyard and stared up at the sky. She missed being able to see the stars like this, the view definitely wasn't the same in Los Angeles. \"There you are\" Catherine said from behind her, as she closed the door. \"What are you doing out here?\" \"Nothing, just relaxing.\" \"Can I join?\" \"Of course,\" Jackie smiled. \"This is the only view you can't get in Los Angeles.\" \"Very true, I'm going to miss it.\" They both sat in silence for a minute, gazing up at the stars before Catherine spoke. \"Jackie...\" \"Mmhmm?\" She mumbled, turning her head. Catherine looked down, obviously nervous to speak. \"I think I'm going to take the Stanford job\" she said, looking up. Stanford. Five and a half hour away, Stanford. Not thinking it was possible, Jackie's world just got even darker. \"I know,\" Jackie responded sweetly. \"You do?\" She asked, looking relieved. \"You always said it was your first choice.\" Although she wasn't lying, Jackie had a small ounce of hope that Catherine would chose UCLA to be close to her. \"Are you upset?\" \"Of course not,\" Jackie replied. \"This is your dream, you didn't stop me from mine.\" \"This is really hard for me. I don't want to be that far away from you, but I don't think either of us would be happy if we sacrificed our careers. It's something we're both passionate about and makes us, us .\" \"It's a lot closer than here\" Jackie chimed in, knowing she had to be as supportive as possible no matter what was going on inside of her head. \"This has all made me think and... I really want you to accept that role when they offer you it. It'll be hard but we will figure out how to make it work.\" Jackie's stomach dropped, a reminder of how lost she was. Not wanting to lie yet not wanting to tell the truth, she just smiled. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too\" she responded, as Catherine came over and kissed her. \"I'm going to go wrap up in there.\" \"Okay, I'll be in in a bit.\" Catherine leaned in again before leaving, \"don't get too tired,\" She whispered in her ear, before gently kissing her on the cheek. She flashed her a seductive smile before disappearing back inside. Jackie knew she couldn't put it off anymore. It was Catherine's big day, it wasn't fair to push her away. She looked through the window and saw her sitting at the kitchen table so quietly went into the living room, grabbing the bottle of vodka and sneaking back outside. She chugged as much of it as she could while keeping a close eye on Catherine's whereabouts. When she saw her beginning to wrap up, she went back inside and placed the bottle back on the cart. She made her way into the kitchen, \"do we have any ice cream left?\" Stalling. \"Yeah, I think so. Are you hungry?\" \"No, just need something sweet.\" Jackie grabbed a spoon but Catherine got to the freezer before her. \"Let's take it upstairs,\" she smiled. When they got upstairs Jackie felt almost as nervous as she did their first time. Thankfully the vodka was beginning to kick in. Since Catherine had blocked her from the ice cream, she was going to have to avoid locking lips with her until she could mask the alcohol on her breath. Catherine had her sit on the bed then grabbed the ice cream and straddled her. \"Is your leg okay?\" She asked, before carefully sitting on her lap. \"Yeah,\" Jackie responded quietly, trying not to let her catch the scent of her breath. Catherine dipped the spoon into the ice cream but leaned into Jackie first. Panicking, she quickly began kissing Catherine's neck. Catherine began to quietly moan, the result of months of celibacy. Jackie pulled back to get to the ice cream but Catherine set it on the night stand and kissed her unexpectedly on the lips. She could feel Catherine begin to pull away as soon as she tasted it, so grabbed her head and kept kissing her, hoping the heat of the moment would make her forget. It didn't though. Catherine quickly broke free. \"Is that vodka?\" \"What?\" Jackie hesitated, \"no.\" Catherine leaned in closer but Jackie leaned back, \"Stop. What are you doing?!\" \"It is. Jackie why do you have vodka on your breath?\" \"Okay, you caught me. I had a drink\" she said, continuing to kiss her. \"When. Why?\" \"I just needed to loosen up. It doesn't matter, come on\" she leaned in but Catherine stopped her. \"What do you need a buzz to sleep with me now?\" \"Catherine stop. Just kiss me, come on,\" Jackie pled. \"No. Look at me.\" She looked away, unable to. \"Jackie, look at me and kiss me if that's what you want to do.\" She took a deep breath in and tried her best to hold in every single emotion that had been silently beating her down, then looked up at Catherine. Her action must have taken her by surprise, because she saw her aggression melt away as soon as they locked eyes. Not wanting her to catch on, she did as asked and kissed her. While deep in their kiss, she fidgeted with her sling, trying to remove it, but Catherine stopped and did it for her. The first time she did it was romantic, now it was just exposing her inadequacies. Jackie reached around and rolled Catherine over onto the bed, crawling on top of her. It only took until she was halfway down her body for her arm to begin shaking, struggling to play double duty and unable to hold her own body weight. As hard she tried, it finally gave and she fell on top of Catherine. She let out a sigh of frustration and tried to begin again but Catherine sat up. \"It's okay\" she smiled, before gently rolling over and taking control. Jackie felt the lump in her throat catch, making it difficult to swallow and knew what was coming. The moment Catherine began undoing her pants, she felt the tears overflow and begin slipping down her cheeks, hoping it was too dark for her to notice. Once they were off, Catherine leaned down and began kissing her neck but must have felt the tears. She placed both hands on either side of Jackie and hovered over her, \"are you crying?\" \"No.\" She wanted to give an excuse but it was all she could slip out, so grabbed Catherine's arm and began kissing it. Catherine began kissing her neck again, but now Jackie's chest began to tremble as she tried choking back the tears. \"You are crying, what's wrong? Am I hurting you?\" \"No, nothing, just keep going,\" she insisted. \"Jackie you're crying, I'm not going to keep going \" she said, before leaning over and turning on the light. As soon as the room illuminated, Jackie placed her hand over her eyes and began to cry even harder. \"What is it?\" she asked concerned. Jackie just shook her head, still covering her eyes. Catherine grabbed her arm and removed it. \"Hey, talk to me,\" she said softly. \"I'm just not having a good day.\" \"Is this about Stanford?\" \" No! \" Jackie insisted. \"Then what is it?\" Jackie knew Catherine wasn't going to let this go until she gave her something, so decided on something small. \"You went for a run today and I can barely make it up these steps without getting winded. You have to remove my sling for me and then just now... I can't even do that for you.\" Catherine took her hand and kissed it and when Jackie finally looked up, Catherine's eye brows were pressed together, her forehead wrinkled in concern. \"Don't pity me, it's the last thing I need. I'm just feeling completely inadequate.\" \"I'm so sorry, I wish you would have told me this. I shouldn't have rushed-\" \"It's been two months, that's a long time for you.\" Catherine looked at her, shocked. \"I'm not going to take offense to that given your current state, and the fact that it may be true,\" she smiled, \"but you're a lot more important to me than sex.\" Jackie just smiled at her. \"Can we at least cuddle?\" She smiled. Jackie nodded and smiled back. The progress they made that night seemed to dissipate as soon as the sun rose. Jackie slipped back into her melancholy ways and Catherine soon found out prying was only making things worse. Jackie began sleeping on and off most days and when Catherine would awake in the middle of the night, she'd be gone. The first couple of nights she found her on the couch watching television, so eventually stopped bothering and just let her have her space. Catherine would be moving to Stanford soon, and the thought of leaving Jackie in the state that she was in both terrified her, and broke her heart. After discovering the amount of liquor missing from her bottles, she knew it was time to either intervene or get help. \"How's you shoulder?\" Catherine asked at dinner. \"Good,\" Jackie replied. \"Is it finally starting to feel back to normal?\" \"Yeah.\" One word responses, Jackie's new favorite. \"If you're feeling up to it, maybe we can start going on walks every day, it might help give you some energy.\" \"Yeah, maybe.\" \"Are you excited to get back to California?\" \"I guess.\" \"Has Wade said when you'd hear back about that movie? It seems like it's been a while.\" \"These big blockbusters usually take a while to cast.\" Catherine thought back to when Jackie landed the role in Neptune 26. It only took a month to hear back and it was going on almost three now. \"Oh wow, so this must be a much bigger deal than Neptune 26 since you heard back pretty fast then, huh?\" Jackie paused before pulling her chair out, \"I'm not really hungry tonight,\" she said before getting up. This was a current theme and their new norm. They would sit in near silence, or Jackie would hardly touch her dinner and disappear into the living room. Catherine placed her hand on her arm, \"Can you talk to me.\" \"Catherine not tonight, I don't feel good.\" She closed her eyes as Jackie began to walk away, the pain she felt not being able to get through to her was unbearable at this point. \"Jackie, I miss you\" she called out quietly. She heard her pause, hoping she would come back, but she didn't. After cleaning up Catherine made her way into the living room and saw her laying on the couch, mindlessly watching the television. That was it. She made her way to the liquor cart and grabbed the two bottles. \"Is this what you do all night when you sneak out of bed? Get drunk? Is that why you lay around all day?\" Jackie ignored her and kept staring at the television, so she put the bottles back down and sat in front of her. \"Jackie please talk to me. Let me inside of your head because it's killing me inside not knowing.\" She finally looked at her. \"No, I'm not excited to go back to LA because I have nothing to go back to.\" \"Your entire career is there. Everything you've worked so hard for.\" \"No it's not. I didn't get the role.\" She said, emotionlessly. \"I'm so sorry. When did you find out?\" \"When we were in LA.\" Catherine looked at her confused, \"You mean months ago?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"It never came up, and when it did, you had just gotten the job at Stanford and I didn't want to interfere in your happiness.\" Catherine placed her hand on Jackie's leg. \"It's fine. It's not like I wanted it anyway.\" \"Regardless of the role, you still have so much going for you. Now you can find a role that you're passionate about, just like you said you wanted.\" \"No one's going to hire me, they all hate me\" Jackie said, her voice still monotone. \"What are you talking about? That's not true.\" Jackie sat up and pulled out her phone. She began typing, then showed Catherine the screen. \"Oh it's not, is it?\" Catherine took the phone and saw dozens of tabloid articles pulled up, all criticizing Jackie for Tommy being in jail. \"This is all bullshit. Is that what you've been reading for the past two months?\" She just looked away, tears forming in her eyes. \"What on earth possessed you to look at these?\" \"After I heard what the paparazzi had to say to me.\" \"What did they say?\" \"That I single handedly ruined Tommy's career.\" \"And you listened? That's complete bullshit Jackie, they were just trying to get a reaction out of you to post in the tabloids. Tommy is to blame for all of this.\" \"You just don't get it,\" she sighed. \"Then help me understand.\" Jackie stayed quiet, continuing to look away. \"Why won't you let me help you?\" Catherine pled. She couldn't handle Jackie's silence any longer, \"I have been in more pain these past few weeks than I ever was the entire year without you\" she said, her voice breaking as she began to cry. Stubbornly looking away, unable to expose her own personal struggles, Jackie had felt entirely dead inside until that moment. The moment she heard Catherine's voice break before sobbing quietly. She quickly looked at her, tears running down her own face. It was that moment she realized that in her attempt to protect Catherine from the darkness inside of her mind, she had caused something worse to happen. Much worse. She had caused Catherine to create her own darkness and suffer in it alone.[Chapter 40] Jackie opened the door and flicked on the lights. She stood in the doorway as she watched her apartment illuminate, taking a minute to look around at the familiar place she once called home. As if almost robotic, she numbly went through the motions of her old routine. Unpacking her things, she caught sight of herself in the medicine cabinet mirror, no longer recognizing the person staring back. She desperately tried to find some sense of familiarity, but the steam of the shower fogged her reflection. Stepping inside, she let the hot water trickle down her face as she thought back to that night with Catherine. Catherine sat in front of her sobbing in a way she had never seen, causing her heart to shatter into a million pieces. She sat there, astounded by the affect she had on her. After taking it all in, she knelt in front of her and took her in her arms, the only thing she knew to do. Catherine dropped her hands from her face and wrapped her arms around Jackie's torso as she continued to cry. Jackie just held her closely for a while until her trembling stopped and tears ceased. When Catherine slowly pulled away, Jackie wiped her tears. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Don't I make you happy anymore?\" Catherine asked quietly. Jackie just stared at her, completely at a loss for words. She watched as Catherine flinched at her hesitation and saw the pain encompass her face as she stood. \"Wait,\" Jackie called out as she grabbed her wrists, pulling her back down. \"I'm so empty inside and it terrifies me. I am completely numb, I literally feel nothing.\" \"For me?\" She asked. \"For anything. But seeing this affect I have on you,\" Jackie went on as she held Catherine's hands. \"It completely destroys me knowing I could do this to you. I didn't mean for this to happen, I meant for the opposite.\" \"You've been treating me this way on purpose?\" \"I saw how I was draining the life from you and didn't want to bring you down with me, so I isolated myself.\" Catherine looked at her, \"Jackie as physically exhausted as I was then, I wasn't unhappy. I thought I had lost you that night so having you here, being able to take care of you, I was grateful for every minute of it. I was genuinely happy. Now I'm just miserable. You made me feel like nothing I could do would be enough. And now, what you just said, what does this even mean?\" Jackie turned her gaze to the floor. \"I don't know. I don't know how to fix this,\" she whispered. After what felt like an eternity of silence, Catherine rose and went upstairs without saying a word. Struggling with not knowing the right thing to say, Jackie stayed downstairs for a bit before following after her. When she slowly opened the bedroom door, the band of light coming from the hall shined directly on Catherine. Her back was to Jackie and she was lying in bed, motionless. Jackie quietly closed the door and sat on the side of the bed, her back to Catherine's. \"I know how unfair this has been to you.\" Catherine was silent but she knew she was awake, so laid down next to her. \"What can I do?\" She whispered, turning her head towards her. Catherine didn't respond so she got to her knees and pulled her shoulder back, turning her around until she was laying on her back. \"I don't think you're in love with me anymore.\" \"That's not true\" Jackie insisted, supplying a defensive expression. \"You said you felt nothing for me.\" \"That has nothing to do with-\" \"You haven't touched me in weeks\" Catherine interrupted. \"Not even a hug, do you know how terrible-\" Jackie leaned down and kissed her, cutting her off but Catherine pushed her away. \"Stop it, I know it's not real.\" Struggling with her, Jackie grabbed her hands and pinned them to her sides. She saw the despair in Catherine's eyes and stared into them, hoping she would see that the person who loved her was still inside of her somewhere. Catherine's chest trembled, so physically upset, causing Jackie to be drawn back to her, wanting so desperately to console her. She kissed her again, this time she meant it. She felt Catherine beginning to kiss her back, and her arms ease under her hands, so let go of them. Suddenly the two of them were pulled into every emotion of everything that had ever happened between them. Things began to heat up, but Jackie could taste the saltiness of Catherine's tears. Pulling herself away, she gently wiped her tears away and softly kissed both of her cheeks before continuing on. Rachel arrived the next day to help them pack for Catherine's big move, leaving them no time to discuss what transpired the night before. Despite what happened that night, things still weren't the same. Catherine reached over and placed her hand over Jackie's as they were driving to the airport. Jackie looked down then up at Catherine who flashed her a small smile as she squeezed her hand. Jackie just smiled back before looking out the window again. As guilty as it made her feel, she was relieved Rachel was coming. \"Hey girls!\" Rachel squealed as she ran and hugged them both. \"I missed you two so much!\" Rachel chatted their ears off the entire ride home, pausing only for a moment to ask how they were doing. They both hesitated before offering a generic, \"great!\" Before beginning their packing duties, Catherine cooked them dinner as they enjoyed multiple glasses of wine throughout the night. Jackie could feel Catherine mentally keeping track of how many glasses she had, which was becoming irritating. Rachel gulped down the last bit of hers and asked if anyone else wanted another a glass as she stood. \"I'll take one,\" Jackie responded, however Catherine's facial expression let on that she thought she had had enough. \"Actually, never mind. I think I'm going to turn in for the night.\" \"Aww so soon?\" Rachel whined. \"Yeah, sorry. I'm wiped out and the wine didn't help.\" \"Ok, well sleep tight. Catherine, another glass?\" As Jackie was changing for bed, Catherine came into the bedroom. \"Are you okay?\" she asked. \"I'm fine.\" \"You don't seem fine.\" \"What do I seem then? Drunk?\" \"I didn't say that.\" \"You didn't have to. I saw you judging me for every glass of wine that I had.\" \"I'm just worried about you,\" Catherine said softly. \"Well, you don't need to be. I'm a big girl, I think I've made it pretty clear that I don't need your help any more,\" Jackie snapped. After Catherine didn't fire back at her, she looked up and saw the shock in her eyes. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that\" Jackie apologized, but Catherine turned and left. The next day when Jackie woke up, Catherine wasn't in bed next to her. She wasn't sure if she slept through her coming and going, or if she never came to bed at all. Feeling guilty for snapping at her, she was nervous to see what type of mood she was in, hoping there wouldn't be a scene in front of Rachel. When she reached the kitchen, the two of them were packing up the dishes. \"Hey sleepy head,\" Rachel joked. \"Looks like little Miss Hollywood can't hang anymore.\" \"Very funny\" Jackie responded, noticing Catherine ignoring her presence. \"So where do you want me?\" Jackie asked. \"You can start on that cabinet\" Catherine replied, pointing to it, but still avoiding eye contact. Later, when Catherine left to go pick up lunch, Rachel turned to Jackie almost immediately. \"What's going on between the two of you?\" \"Why? What did she say?\" Jackie asked. \"Nothing, she didn't have to. I just spent all morning in the same room with you two and you hardly even looked at each other. Usually I can cut the sexual tension with a knife.\" \"I snapped at her last night when I shouldn't have.\" \"Why, what happened? Everything seemed fine.\" \"Just stupid shit, I felt her judging me for how many glasses of wine I was having so said things I shouldn't have.\" \"Has that been a problem lately or something?\" \"No. Well, maybe a little.\" \"Jackie!\" \"Stop. I don't need this from you too. I don't have a drinking problem.\" \"You better not, or I'll bust your ass!\" Rachel teased, putting her fist up to her face. Later that day when they were finished packing, Jackie went upstairs to take a shower. When she was on her way back downstairs she overheard Rachel and Catherine talking about her, so paused at the top of the steps. \"I just feel like I can't make her happy anymore. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.\" \"She's just going through a hard time,\" Rachel insisted. \"Maybe. Or maybe she just doesn't love me anymore.\" Jackie could hear Catherine choking on her words. \"Oh Catherine, she still loves you.\" Not wanting to bombard them, Jackie made as much noise as she could coming down the stairs. When she entered the room, Catherine quickly said she was going to go take a shower now. Once she was out of eye sight Rachel pointed up the stairs, \"go talk to her!\" She whispered. Jackie hesitated and Rachel yelled at her once more, pushing her. \"Go! You two take all the time you need, I'll be down here.\" By the time Jackie got upstairs, the shower was already running and the door was closed so she sat on the bed and waited. As she was waiting she saw the stuffed bunny Catherine kept above the bed and smiled, grabbing it. She thought back to that first night, how terrified she was of Catherine. To think, now, she had the power to absolutely destroy the once overly confident woman she was so scared of, it made her feel awful. Not long after the shower stopped, Catherine opened the door and came into the bedroom. \"Can we talk for a minute?\" \"Jackie, Rachel's here-\" \"She's fine. Please?\" \"Let me get dressed first.\" Jackie fidgeted with the bunny as Catherine dressed, realizing she never asked Catherine about the story behind it. It didn't exactly fit Catherine's personality, or decor. Catherine stood in front of her once she was dressed. \"Sit\" she patted. When Catherine sat, she put the bunny down and turned to her, \"I'm really sorry for snapping at you last night. I didn't mean it.\" \"I just don't understand. What was the other night? Just a way to shut me up?\" \" No, of course not.\" Catherine kept her focus on the ground. \"You know I appreciate everything you've done for me right?\" Catherine didn't answer. \"Right?\" \"I'm not sure of anything anymore\" she finally said, looking up at Jackie. \"I still love you, I hope you know that. The other night was real. And you don't deserve the way I've been treating you in the slightest. I'm just in this really bad place and I don't know how to get out of it, but none of that is because of you. I promise you that's the truth. It kills me seeing the way I'm hurting you.\" \"I just don't know what else to do\" Catherine sighed. \"There isn't anything more you can do, you've been my rock throughout this all. I'm just a really independent person, so suddenly being faced with all of these limitations, it's been hard. It's also got me thinking. After we get you moved to Stanford, I'm going to go back to LA for a while and let you settle in.\" Catherine looked up at her, confused. \"Not like that,\" Jackie insisted, shaking her head. \"Just some time for me to get my head straight. I think we both need some time to figure out our lives and you're going to be so busy at Stanford, I don't want to get in the way of that.\" Catherine picked up the bunny and rubbed its ear between her fingers. \"I just want you to be happy again.\" \"I want us both to be happy again.\" Jackie leaned over and hugged her for a long while. When she let go she noticed Catherine still holding the bunny. \"Where'd you get that from anyway?\" \"My mom\" she smiled. Jackie took it from her hands and kissed it before handing it back to her. Things after that seemed fine, they were able to enjoy the time they had left with Rachel without the tension. When the weekend was over and they loaded all of Catherine's belongings into the moving truck, they looked back at the house. \"I'll leave you two alone\" Rachel said, getting into the car. Jackie watched as Catherine stared at the house. \"Are you okay?\" She asked. \"Yeah, I just never thought I'd ever be leaving this place.\" \"It's not gone forever, we'll be back. I promise\" Jackie said, rubbing her back. When they landed in California, Rachel immediately went back to LA to give Catherine and Jackie some time alone. Jackie only stayed for a day, to get Catherine's essentials put away. She scheduled her flight back to LA early in the morning, thinking it would be best not to drag out a long goodbye. When the alarm went off early at 5am, she quietly rolled out of bed but felt Catherine's hand on her arm. \"Stay.\" Jackie smiled, \"okay but I only can a little longer.\" She moved in closer before she heard her whisper, \"don't go.\" The words broke Jackie's heart. \"Catherine...\" Jackie said, hugging her tightly. \"This isn't goodbye, it's just an 'I'll see you later' as cliche as that sounds.\" \"I hope so.\" \"It is.\" When she came back from the bathroom she turned on the light and packed her remaining things as Catherine sat on the bed. \"So is this your thing? You leave me broken in my bed\" she joked, but Jackie could tell she wasn't. After a long hug and kiss goodbye, she left. Just like she did in Bloomington. In some ways it was better, she wasn't leaving her with nothing. She had a great job to look forward to. But in one way it was worse. Much worse. This time Catherine asked her to stay. When Jackie brought the wash cloth up to her arm she saw how red her skin was. She realized she had been in the shower a lot longer than she had planned so quickly wrapped up. When she stepped out, the entire bathroom was filled with steam. She rubbed the sleeve of her robe over the mirror and looked at herself again. This time she focused in on her eyes, remembering the way Catherine had taught her when she was feeling lost. Then she saw it. Herself. She was still there, and she would find her way back to Catherine.[Chapter 41] Catherine tried to go back to sleep but found it impossible. She knew this time was different, but it didn't make it hurt any less. Last time she released Jackie to live her dream, now Jackie was releasing her to do the same. She would come back this time though, wouldn't she? As Catherine laid in bed she thought back to before, how Jackie didn't even attempt to make contact with her. If it wasn't for her reaching out, none of this would have ever happened, they'd both still be leading separate lives. The last four months had been a whirlwind-Four months, wow. How is it possible they experienced so much in just four months? So many different cities, so many different hotel rooms, so much happiness, so much heart break. The longer she laid awake, the more her mind wandered. Their first time around was only four months as well, that couldn't be right- could it? She counted in her mind, it was. Only a few short months before things went sour. Could they really make it considering this was now their second go at it and still found themselves drifting apart? An odd sense of relief surfaced. She was thankful she took the Stanford job, she couldn't imagine being in LA if they didn't work out this time. No. She didn't want to think like that. Despite it all, Catherine couldn't imagine going back to a life without Jackie. Wanting to shake the sudden sickness she felt at the pit of her stomach, she got out of bed. Even though it was only 6:00am, she grabbed Ethan's leash and took him for a walk around the new neighborhood they called home, hoping to silence her insecurities. Jackie didn't do much of anything her first week home. She was still nervous about the paparazzi finding out she was back in town so hid out in her apartment, soaking in the solitude of it considering she hadn't been alone in months. Rachel was on her way over now though to drop off some scripts for her to take a look at. \"Hey kiddo, welcome home\" she smiled, her arms filled with scripts and bags of Jackie's favorite take out. \"Bless your heart!\" Jackie beamed as she helped her with the load. \"You don't know how long I've been craving this.\" \"So how's it been, being back home and all?\" Rachel asked, as she emptied the bags onto the coffee table. \"Good\" Jackie said, tearing open the containers and stuffing her face. Rachel shot her a look. \"What?\" She asked with a mouthful of food. \"That's all you're going to give me? You've been gone for months, survived a terrible accident, are miles away from your girlfriend, and all I get is a 'good'?\" Jackie rolled her eyes. \"Can I just have one week to myself without someone on my case? Exhibit A- all of the things you just listed that I went through, don't I deserve some time to myself to do absolutely nothing?\" \"Yes, and now that week is over so here you are\" she said, pushing the scripts across the table. \"How long do I have?\" \"First one is in a few days.\" \"Negative.\" She shot back. \"Jacks...\" \"I need time to get back on the horse.\" \"It's acting, not bull riding.\" \"Tell that to the studio execs who cut me out of their feature.\" \"What do you mean?\" Rachel asked confused. \"Wade didn't tell you?\" \"No?\" \"They want me. Wanted me. But said due to the extent of my injuries, I am too much of a liability\" Jackie said, mocking their words. \"That's a load of crap.\" \"Yeah, well, apparently I'm a cripple now.\" \"Forget them, you didn't want it anyway.\" \"I didn't then...\" \"But you do now?\" \"It might have been nice to throw myself into something.\" \"You really think you and Catherine could've handled that?\" \"Is she here right now?\" Jackie asked, looking around sarcastically. \"No, because you left her.\" \"I didn't leave her any more than she left me\" Jackie responded defensively. \"She took that job at Stanford, she could have taken the UCLA position. Even before things changed, it was never in our plans for me to move down there. Not full time at least, I can't.\" \"How is she doing?\" \"Fine, I assume.\" \"You haven't talked to her?\" Jackie could feel her judgements. \"Here and there. She's really busy setting up her apartment and everything with her job, I don't want to get in the way and mess her life up more than I already have. Especially now.\" When she looked up Rachel was just looking back at her, concerned. \"Things got really rough those last few weeks. She didn't deserve that version of me. I just need some time.\" \"I hope you guys work it out\" Rachel said, supplying a sad face. \"We will, we're just in a transition. We'll be fine.\" Jackie spent the next few days memorizing the scripts, uneasy about jumping back into it so soon. Despite Wade and Rachel's wishes, she was going to skip the first one, she didn't want to go into her first audition back unprepared. It was times like these she missed Catherine's support. It had been a few days since they had talked, so she decided to call her. Once she dialed, she sat back on the couch and fanned the pages of the script in anticipation of hearing Catherine's voice, realizing how much she had missed her. It rang longer than usual until finally going to voicemail, that was a first. Catherine's living room was a mess. She tore through every box looking for it, but it was no where to be found. There was no way she left it in Bloomington, she remembered packing it. When she went back into her bedroom to double check, she saw her phone screen was lit up. \"Hey there!\" Jackie responded cheerfully on the other end. \"Hey, sorry, I was in the other room\" Catherine sighed, laying down on the bed. \"Are you okay?\" \"No, I think I lost something in the move and I've been tearing open every single box looking for it.\" \"Oh no, what did you lose? \"Don't laugh.\" \"I promise\" Jackie responded. \"My bunny.\" \"Aw, well I'm sure you'll find it when you're least expecting it.\" \"I hope so, what's up with you? Did you need something?\" The phone call was quite unexpected. \"No, just sitting here trying to memorize a script, realizing it was much more fun when you would help me.\" \"Oh really? Are you starting to audition again?\" Catherine was thrilled to hear that Jackie was getting back to work, and more thrilled that she was thinking about her. \"Yes, ugh that makes me nauseous just saying it.\" \"You're going to do great, is there someone you can practice with? Rachel maybe?\" Jackie laughed, \"she's not the greatest person to read lines with.\" \"I wish I could help.\" \"Me too, so what's new with you? Sounds like the apartment is a headache, but how's Stanford?\" They talked a little longer about Catherine's new life in Stanford before Jackie let her go. She seemed well, happier. A lot happier than she had been in Bloomington at least. Catherine was hoping she was making improvements and was wondering when they'd see each other next. Thankfully she had her work to throw herself into in the meantime. Catherine seemed stressed and distracted, Jackie hoped she wasn't adding to it. She couldn't let her emotions get in the way of her plan to work on herself though. After that call she decided to give her some more time to adjust, communicating with her less and spending all of her time diving into the scripts, brushing up her acting techniques, and most importantly- not picking up a bottle of alcohol. As the first day of classes drew nearer, Catherine became more and more nervous. She spent the majority of her time working on lesson plans, trying to revamp her originals considering she was now at big time Stanford. She wanted to keep things fresh and exciting, spending many late nights pushing herself to do more. Despite the long hours she was putting in, Jackie's silence wasn't going unnoticed. The day of her first audition, Jackie looked in the mirror, carefully smoothing her hair in place. \"You've got this,\" she told herself confidently. When she arrived, she took a deep breath in the car before going in, her stomach in knots. As she entered the hallway there was a sea of girls waiting, all staring at their scripts and mumbling the lines to themselves. She caught eyes with a few of them as she made her way to check in. On her way back to find a seat, more and more girls were now staring at her and whispering as she walked down the hall. Unable to find an empty chair, she leaned against the wall as the whispering became more profound. She tried to ignore them but caught on to some of their words, \"Drunk. Tommy. Car. Hiding.\" She tried to block it out by reading the lines on the page, but they began to blur as she saw the tears beginning to form. Her heart began to race so hard she could hear it pounding in her ears as both they, and her face, began to radiate. The swirling of the whispering was amplifying, making her head spin, and with that she quickly disappeared around the corner and out the building. As soon as she reached her car she began sobbing. She pounded her fists against the steering wheel, she had worked so hard since coming back to LA, only to end up right back in the dark place she had come from. Driving home, she became more and more angry over what had just happened. Walking to her door, she pulled out her phone. She couldn't call Rachel because she would be mad at her for missing the audition, and she most certainly couldn't call Catherine because she didn't want her to know she had failed. Pausing at the door, she placed her phone back in her pocket and turned around, heading back down the street. \"Hey Catherine.\" \"Hey Rachel, what's up?\" Catherine asked, as she balanced the phone between her shoulder and ear, busily collecting her things from the desk. \"Is Jackie visiting you?\" \"No, why?\" She asked confused. \"She didn't show up for her audition today.\" Catherine stopped what she was doing, \"you're kidding me.\" \"I wish I was.\" \"Well did you check her apartment?\" \"That's where I am right now.\" Catherine sighed, \"I'll try to get a hold of her but if she's not answering you, I doubt she will answer me. We haven't exactly been taking much lately. Let me know if you hear anything.\" When a couple of hours past and Rachel still hadn't heard from Jackie, Catherine began to worry. Struggling to pay attention to her work without glancing at her phone every few minutes, she decided to just head to Los Angeles to put her mind at ease. Classes began on Monday, so spending her last few days in LA wasn't exactly what she wanted, but she couldn't help what she feared. After the long drive, it was almost 11pm by the time she arrived at Jackie's apartment. She decided to first try to buzz her at the main door but when she didn't answer, she pulled the key out that she still had from when Jackie was in the hospital. The apartment was dark and when she flipped on the lights she was taken aback at the filthiness of it, take out boxes and alcohol bottles everywhere. So much for working on herself. Catherine had spotted her car when she was parking, so decided to walk down the street and check out the spots she had taken her before. With no luck, she headed back. Just then, she thought she spotted Jackie walking down the street in front of her, but she wasn't alone. Catherine pulled out her cell phone and dialed Jackie's number. She paused as she watched her remove the phone from her pocket, look at it, then slide it back into her jeans. In disbelief, unable to move, she then looked on as Jackie and the girl disappear into her apartment. \"Jackie's fine and at her apartment, I'm going back home.\" Catherine texted Rachel before making her way back to the car. Before Catherine even opened the door, Rachel was calling her. \"You're going back to Stanford? It's almost midnight, what's going on?\" \"I just need to get out of here, I don't need this right now.\" \"If something happened with you and Jackie, stay at my apartment. It's way too late for you to drive.\" \"I'll be okay, I'll stop if I get too tired.\" The next morning Jackie woke up to Rachel shouting at her. \"Screening your calls now, are we? Where have you been?\" \"Here\" Jackie responded, annoyed to be awoken in such a way. \"No you weren't. I was here. What the hell is this Jackie? Look at this mess, I could smell the alcohol from the hallway. Why didn't you go to your audition?\" \"I forgot about it.\" \"Forgot about it? So you couldn't even pick up your phone? Do you know how worried we were? Not to mention poor Catherine drove all the way up here when she starts her new job Monday.\" \"Wait, what?\" \"What do you mean what?\" \"Catherine wasn't here.\" \"Yes she was, I talked to her myself.\" \"Rachel, Catherine was never here.\" Rachel pulled out her phone and showed her Catherine's message, \"I even talked to her on the phone, she was pretty upset.\" \"I don't understand. I never saw her,\" Jackie said confused. Just then the toilet flushed and Rachel looked at her suspiciously. The door opened and a blonde girl walked into the living room shyly. \"I'm going to head out, I'll see you later\" she said, before grabbing her purse from the chair and letting herself out. \"Who are you?\" Rachel snapped, after turning back to Jackie, eyes full of disappointment. \"No wonder Catherine was so upset that she drove straight back home.\" \"It's not what it looks like.\" \"All I see is an apartment full of booze and a girl leaving your apartment early in the morning. How would you like to see this scene at Catherine's?\" \"She's just a friend. Can't I have age appropriate friends?\" \"Age appropriate friends? Gee, thanks Jackie. I'll be sure to relay that one back to your much more mature girlfriend who just spent the last few months aiding you back to health for you just to disrespect her like this.\" Rachel looked around the apartment before turning back one last time as she opened the door, \"you know, I was always so impressed with how great of a person you turned out to be considering you were a child actor. But now...\" She just shook her head. \"This isn't you. Catherine deserves better.\" And with that she closed the door and left. After Rachel left, Jackie called Catherine but there was no answer, and their continued to be no answer the rest of the weekend.[Chapter 42] The first week of classes proved to be exhausting. With everything that happened over the weekend, mixing with her nerves, Catherine hadn't been able to get more than a couple hours of sleep a night. After Jackie called her nonstop she had to cave and write back, asking for some space, unable to deal with it on top of school. When she finally returned to her office after her final class on Friday, she spotted a vase of flowers sitting on her desk. As upset as she was, she was relieved to see them. Although she had asked for space, it hurt that Jackie had listened, especially considering she had yet to explain herself. She smiled as she removed the card but it soon disappeared when she saw they weren't from her. They were from the staff, welcoming her and congratulating her on her first week. \"You survived!\" She heard from the door. When she turned around she saw a fellow professor standing in the doorway and smiled. \"I did. Thanks so much, this is so sweet of you all.\" \"You're welcome. I hope the first week wasn't too rough.\" \"It's taking some adjusting, but I'm incredibly grateful to be here,\" she smiled. \"We're grateful to have you, have a good weekend!\" \"You too, thanks again!\" Catherine turned around and began packing her things when she heard another knock. As nice as it was to have friendly coworkers, she really just wanted to get home to a warm bath and a glass of wine. When she turned around she saw Jackie standing there and her heart dropped. They just looked at each other before Jackie revealed a plant she had hidden behind her back. \"I see someone beat me to the punch\" she said, offering a small smile as she looked at the flowers. \"Can we talk?\" She asked softly. \"Not here. You shouldn't be here\" Catherine said, fumbling with her papers. \"You didn't give me a choice, you wouldn't return my phone calls.\" \"Doesn't feel good, does it?\" \"I'm really sorry you drove all the way to LA. If I would've known...\" \"Jackie I'm serious, you shouldn't be here. This is my job.\" \"Please, just give me a minute to explain. I gave you the space you asked for, but you really need to hear the whole story.\" Catherine hesitated before finally asking her to shut the door. \"I'm sorry you drove all that way. If I knew you were going to do that, I would've answered my phone.\" Catherine continued rustling around her desk. \"Catherine... Please...\" \"Why did you ignore my calls?\" Catherine quietly snapped, looking at her. \"I knew you'd be upset about me missing my audition, and I just couldn't handle disappointing you again.\" \"You know, when you got into your accident, I swore I would never hold back my feelings for you again, no matter how scary it was. But now-\" she began to choke up and tried hard not to. \"I never expected you to hurt me like this.\" \"What did you see? I didn't even see you, and if Rachel said something- she was just drunk so I offered her to stay.\" \"She stayed the night?\" Catherine couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"This is all a misunderstanding. Why don't you just tell me your side first.\" \"I drove to LA after no one could get a hold of you all day. I checked your apartment first then the local spots, and as I was walking down the street I literally watched you ignore my call as you led a girl into your apartment at midnight. Do you have any idea how that felt?\" \"It was Sarah.\" \"I don't want to know her name.\" \"Catherine!\" Jackie yelled, coming over to her and grabbing her arm. \"Keep your voice down!\" She hissed. \"And don't you dare touch me\" she said, jerking her arm free. Jackie grabbed her shoulders and pushed her against the wall. \"Catherine it was Sarah, the barista I introduced you to at the coffee shop. We had a few drinks and she was too drunk to drive so she slept in my bed while I took the couch.\" Catherine looked at her in disgust. \"She slept in your bed?\" \"No. I mean yes, but I wasn't in there. I would never do that to you! She's just a friend. And she's straight!\" \"How do you know? Did you try something?\" \"Catherine...\" \"What if she wasn't straight Jackie, would you have?\" \"You know I would never do that to you.\" \"Do I? Because I'm not sure I know you at all anymore.\" Jackie became silent and dropped her arms from Catherine's shoulders, backing up. Catherine could tell she hurt her feelings. Voices began to gather in the hall and as she opened her mouth to speak, Jackie spoke first. \"I know, I need to leave\" she said, as she turned and left. Catherine stayed pressed against the wall, inhaling deeply as soon as Jackie left, trying to subdue the tears in case someone saw her when she was leaving. When she got home she looked around the street for Jackie's car, but didn't see it. She wasn't sure if she'd be there or if she would be on her way back to LA, unsure of which she was hoping for. When she opened the door Ethan greeted her. Dropping to her knees, she rubbed his ears and kissed his head, needing his love. She poured herself a glass of wine and undressed, sinking into the warm bath. Taking a long sip of wine, she grabbed her phone from the ledge and scrolled through, making sure Jackie hadn't tried contacting her. By 11pm she came to the conclusion that she wasn't coming and turned off the lights, heading to bed. Just as she turned off the last lamp, she heard what she thought was knocking on her front door, but it was so soft she was uncertain. Pausing for a second, she heard it again and made her way through the dark living room. She slowly opened the door, only partially and hugged it, using it as a sense of security. Jackie's face was solemn. \"I didn't want to-I couldn't leave without...\" Jackie struggled forming a sentence. \"Catherine I swear on my life nothing happened, nor did the idea even cross my mind. I realize how awful it looked considering my behavior that day but-\" she sighed and looked off to the side. \"It's just, I have been trying so hard to work on myself. I've spent the last week locked in my apartment just working on those scripts, not touching one drop of alcohol because all I want is to get back to myself, and get back to you. But then I got to that audition and everyone was staring at me and whispering, and the things they were saying about me, I couldn't do it. I was so upset at them, I was so upset at myself and the last thing I wanted was to disappoint you, so I turned my phone off and I made a mistake. I turned back to the me that you hate. I went to the liquor store and drank all day, then went to the coffee shop where Sarah saw me and she kept me company the rest of the night. But it was strictly platonic, I swear. If I would have known you were there... Have you seen her? She's not even that attractive and I mean, look what I have with you. You're gorgeous and your dimples that make my heart explode every time I see them. And your heart and sense of humor. I don't know why you're with me or why you put up with me these last couple of months, because I can't even stand myself.\" Jackie was going on and on without taking a breath or looking at Catherine once, just nervously rambling. She was talking a mile a minute which was beginning to melt Catherine's heart, but she just stood there and listened considering this is the most Jackie had spoken in months. \"But hearing you say you don't know me anymore?\" Jackie finally looked at her and placed her hand over her chest, \"that kills me. I'm still here. I'm still me. I'm still porcupine and I miss you, I miss us . I have fucked up in so many ways and all I want is to-\" Before she could go on any more, Catherine came out from behind the door and pulled her into her, holding her tightly. And there they stood on her front porch, just like that for a couple of minutes, not saying a word. \"I don't hate you porcupine,\" Catherine finally whispered as she held her close. \"I'm so sorry for everything.\" \"I know you are. Come on, let's get inside.\" The apartment was almost completely dark, the only light coming from the glow of the stove in the kitchen. After Catherine closed the door she could only see the silhouette of Jackie standing by the couch, biting her lip and nervously looking around. \"I know, it's still a mess. I've just been so preoccupied with school.\" \"Like I could judge.\" Ethan came into the room and went straight to Jackie. She knelt down and greeted him, \"hey buddy, I missed you.\" As she was getting back up she put her hand on her leg and grabbed a box behind her, shifting her weight. \"Are you okay?\" Catherine asked, moving towards her and putting her hand behind her elbow for support. \"Yeah, it just gets stiff. I should probably do those exercises they taught me more.\" Jackie glanced at Catherine's hand on her arm and slowly looked up at her. Catherine slid her hand up to the bottom of her neck and leaned in, pressing her forehead against Jackie's. \"I'm so sorry, I really am. For everything.\" \"I know.\" Catherine slipped her hand a little further up until it rested at the base of Jackie's head, leaning in to kiss her. When they parted lips, Jackie immediately pulled her back into her, returning her kiss, more passionately this time. As Jackie placed her hands around Catherine's neck, Catherine leaned into her, moving her hands down to her body. Jackie stumbled backwards and Catherine extended her arms behind her, placing them onto the edge of the box to catch her balance, but over estimated its sturdiness. The top box caved in causing Jackie to fall back into it, Catherine tumbling on top of her. They both began to laugh as Catherine got up off of her, \"are you okay?! Your shoulder?\" Jackie laughed, \"I'm fine, just get me up\" she responded, holding her hands up for Catherine to take hold. But when she tried to pull Jackie up, she wouldn't budge. \"My body has become one with this box,\" Jackie laughed hysterically. Catherine tried again to pull her up but failed, mostly due to neither of them having the strength from laughing so hard. \"Okay, okay. One more try.\" This time they succeeded. \"Are you okay?\" Catherine laughed, as Jackie stood to her feet. \"I think so\" Jackie giggled. \"Maybe we should get out of this danger zone.\" Catherine grabbed Jackie's hand and led her back to the bedroom. As they passed the kitchen she looked back and smirked but saw the blood on Jackie's arm in the glow of the light. \"You're bleeding\" she said, lifting the sleeve of Jackie's shirt. \"Come on, let me clean you up.\" Jackie squinted as her eyes adjusted to the brightness of the bathroom. \"I know I have band-aids somewhere around here.\" \"It's really not that big of a deal, it's just a scratch.\" \"Ah ha! Here we are.\" Catherine cleaned the cut before placing the band-aid on it, then kissed it gently. Jackie smiled at her, \"always fixing me.\" \"Someone has to,\" she grinned. When they got to the bedroom Jackie sat down on the bed. Catherine took her face in her hands and slowly kissed her. \"You didn't have a bag\" she blurted out, mid-kiss. \"Huh?\" Jackie mumbled confused, eyes still closed. \"You didn't have anything with you, do you have to be somewhere?\" \"I don't want to be anywhere but here.\" \"Jackie...\" \"I have an audition tomorrow.\" \"What time?\" Jackie just smirked, \"it doesn't matter.\" \"You can't miss another audition.\" Jackie just kept smiling. \"Catherine, I don't care\" she said, taking her hands. \"I don't want that life anymore. I missed my flight anyway.\" \"Don't say that, you're just having a rough time.\" \"Yeah, I am. And it's not worth it. Look what it's doing to me, look what it's doing to us. Look what it did to us.\" \"It's your passion. Speaking from someone who almost lost theirs, you'll regret it if you walk away again.\" Jackie just looked at her. \"Now, what time is it?\" \"Noon,\" Jackie muttered unwillingly. \"Okay then, we'll get up early and I will make sure you go through with this one\" Catherine said, moving the hair from Jackie's eyes and smiling. She grabbed her laptop from the night stand and opened it, booking two flights for first thing in the morning. \"Make them both round trip,\" Jackie said, leaning over her shoulder as she watched. \"You don't have any other auditions coming up?\" \"No.\" \"Are you lying to me?\" Catherine asked skeptically. Jackie reached her arm over in front of her and held out her finger, \"pinky promise.\" Catherine looped her pinky around Jackie's and laughed. Just as she was finishing up their reservations she felt Jackie's breath in her ear, \"hurry up.\" Shivers went down her spine feeling the warmth in her ear, \"I'm trying.\" \"You're... not... going... fast... enough\" Jackie said, pausing between each word to kiss Catherine on the neck. As soon as she hit confirm, Jackie reached over her and closed the laptop then pulled Catherine backwards onto the bed. After being up all night, they were both in rare form for the plane ride. Catherine helped Jackie with her makeup to look as awake as possible as they both chugged coffees on their way to the audition. Once again Jackie was greeted with looks and whispers as she waited, this time she had Catherine by her side though. \"Why don't we just give them new material?\" Catherine leaned in and whispered. Jackie looked back at her confused, \"what do you mean? Catherine placed her hand on Jackie's knee and smiled. Jackie looked down at it then smiled back, suddenly understanding. Catherine then took Jackie's hand in her own and sat that way until Jackie's name was called. She kissed her on the cheek before she got up as she wished her good luck, noticing the wondering looks of the other girls' faces. When Jackie's audition was over and she came back out, Catherine stood and linked her arm around Jackie's as they left, leaving an entire room of girls with shocked expressions. \"Oh my God!\" Jackie exhaled as soon as they were out the door. \"Their faces!\" \"I know,\" Catherine laughed. \"And you're okay with this?\" Jackie asked. \"I'm use to the looks, and I don't care anymore. I'm not worried about Stanford, we're not doing anything wrong.\" Jackie's face lit up and she kissed her on the cheek, it was the happiest Catherine had seen her. \"So how was it!?\" \"I think really good!\" \"See, you still got it\" Catherine said, jabbing her elbow into Jackie and winking. Before catching a plane right back to Stanford, they stopped by Jackie's apartment. After getting out of the car Jackie linked her arm through Catherine's. \"So... will you do something for me?\" \"Maybe...\" Catherine responded, looking at her hesitantly. \"Can we stop and get a cappuccino.\" Catherine flashed her an unpleasant look. \"Jackie, I don't want to get into that.\" \"Please\" she said eagerly, \"I just want you to see it was nothing. It'll help us both feel better about the situation.\" \"Fine, but only if you don't say anything.\" \"I promise.\" Jackie held the door open for Catherine as they entered. \"Hi Jackie!\" \"Hey Sarah, you remember Catherine.\" Sarah looked shocked yet excited, \"of course! Hi Catherine, I'm glad to see you and I know Jackie is too\" she winked. Catherine smiled, suddenly feeling ashamed of herself. It was silly to think Jackie and Sarah were fooling around behind her back. \"It's good to see you too.\" After Sarah hugged them both goodbye, Jackie turned and nudged Catherine once they were out the door. \" See .\" \"Okay, I admit it, I was being foolish.\" \"It's okay, I was being a jerk.\" Stepping inside Jackie's apartment, it was still a mess. Bottles everywhere. \"I'm sorry. I was a mess and didn't have time to clean up,\" Jackie said bashfully. \"Jackie,\" Catherine said before pausing. \"Do you need help with this?\" \"No of course not, just give me a second to throw this all away.\" \"That's not what I meant\" she said, grabbing her arm. \"Oh,\" Jackie looked down at the bottles in her hands. \"No, I don't think so. I know it looks bad, and I've been using it as a crutch, but I don't need it.\" Catherine looked at her worriedly. \"I promise. If I feel like I do, I'll tell you.\" Catherine trusted her but hoped it was true. After packing some of Jackie's things they headed to the airport and went straight back to Stanford. As soon as they got back to the apartment they collapsed in bed, exhausted from the chaotic day. Before falling asleep Catherine heard Jackie whisper to her as her eyes grew heavy and closed. She opened them slightly. \"This is it.\" Jackie said. \"What?\" She asked. \"This is it. No more bullshit. I promise.\" \"You're making a lot of promises today.\" \"I know, and I'm going to prove them.\" \"I hope so\" Catherine whispered before falling asleep. They spent the next week inseparable. When Catherine was at work, Jackie was back at her apartment finishing up her unpacking for her, which removed a lot of stress when she'd return home at night. Midway through the week Catherine was surprised to find Jackie knocking on her office door. \"Is this okay?\" She asked. \"Yeah, of course. Come in\" Catherine smiled as she got up and hugged her. \"I brought some lunch, I tried my best but I'm sorry if it's awful.\" \"I'm sure it's delicious, thank you,\" Catherine beamed as she kissed her. \"So I have some news,\" Jackie said after taking a bite of the sandwich. \"Oh?\" Before she could speak there was a knock on the door. \"Come in,\" Catherine called out. \"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. We were just going to lunch and didn't know if you wanted to join.\" \"I've got some already but thanks! This is my girlfriend Jackie, Jackie this is Jennifer. She's another Psychology Professor here.\" \"Oh, it's so nice to meet you!\" Jennifer smiled as she shook Jackie's hand. \"Likewise,\" Jackie said, in somewhat of shock. Once Jennifer left she turned to Catherine. \"New chapter, right?\" Was all Catherine said. \"It sure is\" Jackie smiled. \"Is it weird how easy this all suddenly feels? Why did we stress out about it so much?\" \"We are complicated people. So what was your news?\" \"Oh! I got the role!\" Catherine's mouth dropped before turning into a giant smile. She got up and came around the desk, hugging Jackie tightly. \"Congratulations! I'm so proud of you!\" \"Thanks, and thanks for getting me back out there. I'm really excited for this one.\" After a month of blissful living and office visits during lunchtime, Jackie had to head back to LA to prepare for her new movie. The night before her flight back, Wade sent her the filming schedule and as she looked it over, her heart broke. She would have to film overseas during Thanksgiving when she had promised Catherine they would go back to Bloomington for the holiday. Making it worse was the fact that despite Jackie's wishes, Catherine had decided to put the house on the market and it would most likely be the last time they could visit. Catherine was going to be devastated. Not knowing how to tell her, she just handed her the schedule, \"I am so sorry.\" She watched as Catherine tried not to look upset, but could see the disappointment in her eyes once she saw the date. \"It's okay, there's nothing you can do.\" Jackie just hugged her. \"I'll be okay. I've made it this many years, I can handle another holiday. And it's not like I'm completely alone, you'll just be across the ocean. This is huge for you, I don't want you to feel guilty.\" As hard as it was, it was the happiest farewell they had ever had, knowing this time it was different in the best way possible. This time they didn't have to worry about an uncertain future. Thankful to have made friends, Catherine left Ethan with one of them as she made her journey back to Bloomington. The last week had been hard. Jackie was overseas now filming, so communicating was rough. She was also dealing with the emotional toll of finding out her home in Bloomington had sold and she hadn't been able to tell Jackie yet. When she landed in Indiana, her nostalgia was becoming painful. She couldn't believe this would be her last trip home. Driving the hour from the airport, she couldn't help but cry after feeling extremely overwhelmed with the idea of packing up the house and spending Thanksgiving alone. She wanted nothing more than to just talk to Jackie but she hadn't been able to get in touch with her. All she had received in the last few days were apologies sent through text messages. When she finally got home, she opened the door and turned on the lights. Her realtor had dropped off a bunch of empty boxes for her and the site of them alone stung. Unable to deal with it yet, she went into the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of wine. Starting a fire, she rested on the couch and reminisced about holidays she and her family had spent in the house before her parents had passed. Falling asleep that night wasn't easy. She wasn't use to not having Ethan there and she was missing Jackie terribly, but after much tossing and turning she was able to drift off finally. In the morning she poured herself a cup of coffee and attempted to call Jackie. \"Hey!\" Jackie responded cheerfully on the other end. \"It's you!\" Catherine said excitedly, relieved to have finally gotten her on the phone. \"I'm sorry, the service here is awful and we've been so busy.\" \"I need to tell you something.\" \"Catherine?\" \"Jackie?\" \"Catherine, you're breaking up.\" \"Jackie, can you hear me?\" \"Catherine? I can't hear you. I'll try calling you back later, I love you and miss you so much! Happy Thanksgiving!\" Disappointed, she put her phone down on the counter and sighed. As she drank her coffee, she went into the foyer and stared at the empty boxes that she avoided the night before. \"Happy Thanksgiving\" she muttered aloud. Not wanting to wallow in self pity, she threw herself into making a Thanksgiving feast for herself. The hours ticked by and she still hadn't heard from Jackie. She stared down at the plate she had spent so much time on and smiled, impressed with herself, before taking it into the living room in front of the fire. She never ate in there but figured what the hell, it isn't her house anymore anyway. Just as she was about to take her first bite, the door bell rang. Who in the heck was that? Especially on Thanksgiving. Maybe the neighbors saw the lights on and were worried since she hadn't been home in so long. When she opened the door she couldn't believe her eyes. Jackie was standing on the porch, pumpkin pie in hand. \"Happy Thanksgiving!\" She yelled. \"What are you doing here!?\" Catherine asked excitedly as she grabbed her, careful not to spill the pie. \"Do you really think I would have let you spend Thanksgiving alone?\" \"But your movie?\" \"They were nice enough to give us a few days off. But can I come in? It's freezing and my hands are full!\" Catherine grabbed the pie and set it down, putting her arms around Jackie as soon as she got in the door. \"You don't know how much this means to me.\" \"Yes I do, that's why I'm here\" she said, kissing her. \"Woah, what's all this?\" Jackie asked, looking at the boxes. \"That's what I've been trying to tell you. I sold the house.\" \"No!\" Jackie moaned in sadness. \"I know, I'm having a harder time than I thought. But come on, you came at the right time, I just finished dinner.\" After they caught up with each other and talked all about Jackie's movie and how Stanford was going, Catherine poured them glasses of wine while Jackie went to change. When she came back down she had a grin on her face and her hands were behind her back. \"What?\" Catherine smirked, suspiciously. \"I have an early birthday present for you since I'm going to miss it\" Jackie said, pulling a box out from behind her. Catherine smiled as she handed it to her. She slowly undid the ribbon on the box. When she opened it, she gently pushed back the tissue paper then looked at Jackie when she saw what was inside. \"My bunny! You jerk! I thought I lost this in the move!\" Jackie laughed, \"I told you you would find it when you were least expecting it.\" \"When? How?\" \"I'm sorry. I stole it that last day we were here when we weren't doing well. I needed something to remind me of you while we were separated. I honestly didn't think you would notice, but then when you called me that day I knew I'd have to find a creative way to give it back to you so you didn't hate me for taking it. But that's not all, look closely at it.\" When Catherine looked harder she saw a key tied around its neck. \"A key?\" She asked confused. \"What's it to?\" \"Take it off and I'll show you.\" Jackie took a sip of wine before she stood and held her hand out to Catherine, smiling. Catherine untied the key and placed her hand in Jackie's as she opened the door and led her outside. Catherine walked to the porch and looked around as Jackie closed the front door. \"Where are we going?\" she asked curiously. \"Home,\" Jackie grinned as she placed her hands on Catherine's shoulders and turned her back around to face the house. She put her hand over Catherine's and slid the key into the door to unlock it. \"I don't understand.\" \"I'm the one who bought your house, I told you I would never let you sell it. This is your home and as happy as I know you are in California, it will never compare to this place. You were robbed of a life filled with traditions with people who love you, so I promise to do everything I can to make up for it. Weekend escapes, holidays, summer trips, whenever you want to come back here, we can. Forever.\" Catherine eyes watered as she turned to Jackie. \"I can't believe you did this.\" \"I can't believe you picked me,\" Jackie smiled. Good thing I'm a procrastinator and didn't start packing yet,\" Catherine laughed through her tears. Later that night as Catherine sat cuddled up next to Jackie in front of the fire, she felt like this was all just a dream. She was in her family home, on Thanksgiving, sharing a piece of pumpkin pie with someone who had completely shown her what it felt like to be loved, something she hadn't felt in a long time. Glancing over at the table she saw the stuffed bunny and smiled, looking at Jackie. \"What?\" Jackie laughed uncomfortably when she caught her gaze. \"Nothing\" Catherine replied softly, returning a smile. Her heart finally felt full again. ","Summary":" She put all of her weight down on the suitcase until she finally got the zipper closed. Catherine l"}]
