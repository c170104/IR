She could feel it splintering into a thousand pieces inside her chest. The rain outside echoed her mood, desolate. The Speak Easy was quiet now; nobody dared go near her, not even Sam. She missed him. She missed his smile, his way of talking, the way he was so adorably dumb. He was hers and she was his and everyone saw it. She was trapped here, in this counterfeit impersonation of a once happy place, the walls were as suffocating as Sam's hold on her. The large Italian's ever watchful gaze never left her body as she shakily rose from the table and walked outside into the rain. She had to get away. The memories were killing her. Without him the Speak Easy seemed lifeless. Her shattering heart lead her forwards through the downpour. Her hair was plastered to her face and she wiped away a strand as it flicked into her line of vision. She couldn't see where she was going, the rain was obscuring her eyesight. Her feet lead her onwards as she stumbled through the bare cobbled streets until she could feel the softness of mud underneath her. The grass was slick and she faltered twice before reaching her destination. As she crouched next to the rough stone she began to sob. Nobody could hear her now over the roaring wind and nobody could see her being weak. The memories came flooding back to her. How he'd looked when she first met him, his suit was slightly too big so it hung awkwardly over his shoulders. She smiled fondly but that brought back another sharp painful memory. How he'd smiled at her, not like the others, not in a lustful way but a genuine smile. She'd known from that moment that she would love him forever. The way his hat had tilted forward over his eyes made her heart ache. She remembered the time he'd irritated Sam and ended up needing ice over his eye. She had stayed by his side all night until the swelling had dispersed. She'd secretly never forgiven Sam for that but of course, as ever, had stayed dutifully by his side. Another flash of memory, this time it was only noise, the darkness clouded her mind. She could hear them arguing, once again, but this time it seemed more serious. He was screaming at Sam, telling him to change his ways or he'd leave. She hadn't known it at the time but that fight was about her. They were always about her. A final memory appeared in her mind. Him covered in blood and the remnants of splurge, her screaming into his chest. Sam was stood over them with a calculating look on his face. It was always about being the best, the prettiest, \"The Girl\" but as she lay over his cold unmoving corpse she found that none of that mattered anymore. She broke.

AN: I've incorporated a few lyrics from the Down and out song into this fic. I think they should be obvious, but to be sure they're in italics Down, down, down, down, down, down and out, The soup kitchen was supposed to be a place for God's good work to take place. A place where a good Christian could engage in good works and help their fellow Christian man. In practise, the two ladies who doled out an (inadequate) spoonful of soup into the white bowls and provided but a small piece of bread, found it depressing, as though the fate of these men drove them into the ground as badly as it did those who lived it. Down, down, down, down, down, down and out, It distressed them both that despite the fact that most of these men had fought for their country in the last war. These men had shown courage under fire, faced the worse that modern warfare could throw at them and still came home standing tall. And yet the unrelenting grind of life in the Great Depression had driven them into the ground. The older one could remember how these men had stood tall and marched proudly. Now the government had abandoned them and discarded them like rubbish and now their heads were bowed and the only march they did was closer to a shuffle. Down, down, down, down, down, down and out, For a while, it had seemed like life was going to return to normal after the war. Shipbuilding was down and the docks had less trade, but there were still jobs to be had in the docks and the sea for those who couldn't find or didn't want to work locally. Ships were always willing to hire new hands in port to replace missing, lost or retiring seamen and at least one vessel was searching for crew at any given time. Then the Wall Street crashed and the entire area crashed with it. Shipping dried up as the markets that drove them all but vanished. A handful of ships still came, but their crews were lean and efficient and never enough to support the area that used to rely on them. And as jobs became scarcer, wages were cut and working hours reduced as the work ceased to be there for them to work more hours. And without the working hours to keep men occupied, those with jobs spent their money in speakeasies and the like. And at the bottom of the pile were the men who could be found here, in this depressing, ramshackle building where a sense of despair permeated the very air. Down, down, down, down, down, down and out, When a group of wealthy 'businessmen' (crooks of some sort no doubt, probably gangsters) set up a new warehouse, many of the men had hoped for a job there. The morality of working for criminals who no doubt broke the prohibition was no issue to men who had nothing. But instead the 'businessmen' brought in their own security men and staff, men, no thugs, who had no attachment to the area or the people living there. They were brutal and callous and the locals avoided them as much as possible. Down, down, down, down, down, down and out, Now, when all hope was lost, there was a man in a suit and his dark skinned friend. And he was talking to the men. Talking to them like he actually thought they were worth something, that they could actually do something when they themselves had lost confidence. He fired up the fires that had once burned in them, pulling out a spunk that neither of the ladies had seen in a long time. And for the first time since the soup kitchen had opened, there was something else in the air. Hope. Hope for the future. It was a beautiful sight and a beautiful feeling. It was enough to renew a person's faith in God, long after it had died a hidden death. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Don't own and never will, okay?

The weather mimicked my mood, as the rain poured down on all of us. I observed the area in front of me and the people in it. Fat Sam and Dandy Dan quietly talked to each other, often glancing in my direction. There was no doubt about why. To me it was plainly obvious that they found it awkward to be civil to one another but under the circumstances, and for my sake, they appeared to believe it was for the best. Dandy Dan's wife hovered around her husband waiting for the opportunity to be able to cling onto his arm and get him to leave. I knew she felt some pity towards me, but I didn't care for her feelings. Tallulah, dressed all in black for once instead of one of her vibrant show dresses, seemed to have decided that her sarcastic comments were not needed today and tried to comfort me by smiling sympathetically from a distance. I however also did not care for her sympathy. Fizzy, having been let off a day of work, was here but at a time like this I found even he annoyed me. He gently patted me on the back telling me how much of a loss it was and how much empathy he had for me. It was a complete understatement to call what had happened a \"loss\". For me anyway. I could still remember last time this happened. Well, last time my heart was broken. It was two years ago and I found myself alone and kinda depressed. It was then that I found Fat Sam's Grand Slam, and met Tallulah. She managed to comfort me in the way that she knew best. However I couldn't be comforted like that this time. I'd managed to get back on my feet quite quickly last time but it was different now. Very different. Tallulah called me the 'lone ranger' back then. I guess that's what I am again now. A single tear rolled down my cheek. I wiped it away as I noticed Fat Sam walking over to me with Dandy Dan trailing behind. They both pretended not to notice, and awkwardly stood by me waiting for the other to say something. Sam spoke first. \"I'm sorry Bugsy. I'm so sorry.\" I didn't respond but stared blankly at the two. Dandy Dan stepped forward and cleared his throat uncomfortably. \"I'm also sorry for your loss Bugsy. I wouldn't have... If I'd have known Bronx and Shoulders had tampered with my gun then...\" He paused, contemplating the best words to use. I couldn't care less at what words he used. I wasn't like saying them could do any more damage. \"I've still got the rest of my gang trying to track them down... but they've just disappeared...\" He glanced at Sam nervously before returning his attention to me. \"If the gang find them then I'll let you know so you can... So you can-\" I interrupted him, tired and frustrated with their frankly useless attempts at lifting my spirits. \"I don't care what you do with them Dan. The damage has already been done. Nothing we do is going to reverse it.\" Dandy Dan took a sharp breath in, exhaled slowly, and then nodded. \"Whatever you wish Bugsy.\" I smiled cynically at them. They both tried their best to smile back but hung their heads in shame. I gently pushed past them and strolled slowly to the stone that crushed my heart as heavily as the soil that held it up. I knelt down and solemnly stroked the petals of the flowers that had been left on the bed of earth. More tears tumbled down my cheeks as I read the inscription once again. 'Here rests Blousey Brown, a special friend to the members of the Speakeasy, and especially Bugsy Malone. Tragically taken by an accidental shot. Rest in Peace' Well I hope you guys liked it. Please Review! By the way, I just wanted your thoughts on this; I'm planning on writing what happened before this. Should I post it as the next chapter, or a new story but as the prologue?

He could've at least told me that he had feelings for whoever that millie girl is, whats wrong with ME? But yeah, he could've just told me rather than snogging her in the lobby where we where supposed to be meeting to go to that concert. He promised me that he'd find me a job I've been searching the streets for four months now! I'll give it another two, and then thats it! Im outta here. Gee I thought it'd be easier to find a job in New York, it being a bigger place and all. I power walk down the streets passing diners, jewellery shops (lots of them probably selling illegal things) and then I bring myself to a halt. I look up 'Pop Becker's Book Store'. I'm sure I've heard of this place before. Plus what better to treat my breakup pain than with a book. Ok, ok, it's not for me it might be too sell, once Ive bought it. I know its a really lame idea. Buying the books, selling them at a slightly dearer price, dodging police, dodging authorities. But how else am i gonna get money!? Its not like buskin's legal. Too many stiffs around to be carrying a hat full of cents. I walk in hesitantly. Thats when he walks out. He comes out in something of a hurry, from behind a bookcase. It spins and ten he just walks out. I get a glimpse of the inside; a bar, a stage, slow speakeasy music and tables and chairs filled with people. I think he was expecting to be alone when he came out. But I've heard of those places before, speakeasies. Ive been in a couple before, but never this one. As he turns around and straightens his tie and places his hat back on his head, he notices me. Stood there with my arms crossed. I can now see his face his grey suit, his black gelled hair hidden my his grey hat. \"Hi,\" he mutters, maybe he thinks Ive already been to that speakeasy.

As a matter of fact, most days I don't remember much of anything before Dan's gang. My life before now? I don't usually talk about it, bad for my business. Nobody wants to hear the sappy backstory; I'm making big now. Telling people would ruin my business. I never talk about my past life. All people need to know about me is I'm a dancer for Tallulah at Fat Sam's, why do you need to know any more? Like I said, I don't remember much, really not much to remember. All the good fuzzy memories of my family…my sisters…they don't stick around. It's hard to remember the faces of people who left you livin' …It's hard to remember a livin' face, when every day you see a new dead one. I'll let you in on my sap story, but you can't be blabbing to the press got it? I tell people I'm an only child…well that's not entirely true. Yeah I'm the only De Velt kid left… but that doesn't mean they're aren't others… others who were born with the name, but left it behind long ago. I don't like talking about it… but I hate ignoring it even worse… I'm going to tell you my story, but you can't tell anybody! Especially Sam! If Sam found out…well, let's just say I'd be right back to where I started. Out on the street. Most days I don't remember, but I'm feelin' pretty memorable today. So take notes cuz this may be the first and last time I ever remember how I got my name, and who I really am. My name is Olga De Velt My name is Olivia D. My name is Shoulders. And this is my backstory. Chapter 1: Orphans Oscar My earliest memory… come to think of it, my earliest memory ain't that earlier, it was only a couple years ago. I remember waking up that morning to a horrible coughing. I rubbed my eyes groggily. \"Can you shut her up?\" I grumbled. \"I stayed up with her all night last night. It's your turn.\" Olga growled rolling over. \"God forbid you have to do anything around here.\" \"Oh shut it wisey\" I snapped crawling over her, on the other side of our little sleeping set-up lay my littler sister. \"Hey, Livy, you doin' ok?\" I asked I was answered by another load of hacking. \"I see.\" I took a quick glance outside to see the sun was just starting to come up. \"Alright, I'll be back with some breakfast in a bit. You hang tight.\" If you haven't guessed by now, me and my sisters weren't doin too hot on account of we'd been livin' on the streets since we were in grade school. We'd been orphaned when we was just little tikes, don't remember anything about the 'rents. Just the faces of the nurses at the orphanage, we got kicked outta there on account of me pickin' fights with the other kids. Hey it wasn't my fault all the other kids were numskulls, always whinin' about everything, that really puts my shoulders in a knot, ya know? Anyway like I said, we'd been on our own for a while, by now me and my sister Olga were pretty well adjusted to the hardships, but Olivia, not so much. She was a couple years younger than us and didn't have such a strong sickness fighter if you know what I mean. It was early winter at the time and since we'd been livin in a shack built out of vegetable crates and potato sacks, she didn't do so well when the cold hit. Anyway, what was I sayin'? Oh yeah so I went out to get some warm food (something that was hard to come by for us street kids) and that's when I saw 'em. The mobsters. I was walking past Perito's Bakery when three of 'em came tearing out of the alley. The first one looked pretty beat, probably the target the other two were set to \"take out of the equation\" as The Boss would say (you'll hear more about him later.) The others were sharp, all in suits with them big guns. I ain't gonna lie; I was a little star struck. Anyway, they come tearing outta that alleyway like a bat outta hell. Now, I knew some about these mobsters, there were two big gangs in town. Fat Sam's and Dandy Dan's. I heard most of their happenings through the radio in the diner down the street. Supposedly Dandy just hated Sam for some reason or another, and he was just set on takin' Sam down. Now at the time both gangs were pretty small, so it's not like either of 'em was much of a threat to the other. But still those gangs were fierce about anybody who got in their way, even if they weren't part of another gang. I jumped back and made plenty of room for them to get through; they ran off down the streets and disappeared. I watched them go. \" Wish my life could be that glamorous\". I thought \" Livin everyday on the edge; full of adventure… sure beats scroungin' for a warm crust of bread for your little sister.\" Olga Oscar came back later with a stale loaf of bread from the bakery. \"Old Perito was nice enough to donate to the needy kids.\" Oscar snipped sarcastically. \"Just be happy he didn't call the cops on you for loitering.\" I snapped taking the crusty bread out of his hands. I shook my little sister lightly. \"Come on Liv, wake up, we got a big day ahead of us.\" Olivia sat up groggily rubbing the sleep out of her eyes and coughing. We ate in silence for a while until suddenly Oscar said. \"I saw the mobsters this morning.\" Olivia flinched out the sound of the word. \"You had to bring that up didn't you?\" I snapped. \"What?\" \"You know how much they scare Livy. What did you do now? You better not have said something stupid to make them mad at you! A group of thugs with guns is the last thing we need right now.\" \"Hey listen wisey all I said was I saw them! Now shut your trap and eat!\" It was quiet again for a minute. \"…You didn't make them mad did you Oscar?\" Olivia asked hesitantly. \"I didn't say nothin' to 'em Livy, I just saw them.\" He snapped again, taking a bite out of his share of the bread. \"You need to learn to not be scared of 'em no more got it? They're everywhere these days and you gotta learn to look out for yourself.\" He said in between bites. \"What we need to do is get jobs .\" I snapped. \"And just how you fixin' to do that?\" Oscar muttered. \"We ain't got the perfect resume ya know. We ain't got a resume at all.\" \"Hey at least I'm trying to do something to get off the streets.\" I yelled. \"While all you can think about is those stupid gangsters!\" \"Hey as far as I'm concerned I'm keepin' you two fed! What have you done huh? Zip!\" \"Well it's not like I haven't been trying! I've been going to the soup kitchen and getting us real food! I've been trying to finds us jobs. At least I'm trying!\" \"Hey I told you we wouldn't be takin' any hand-outs!\" \"Well we can't live on stale bread forever!\" I shouted. \"I know you're trying but its not gonna last and you know that! You're just too proud to admit it.\" \"Both of you stop it!\" Olivia wailed. Things went silent. \"…let's just get on with the day.\" Olivia got up and started out of the alley. Olga got up to follow her, as she walked by she glared at me. \"You're the eldest Oscar, it's time you pulled it together and started acting like it.\" Olivia We set out that day leaving Oscar back in the alley. \"So what's so huge that we needed to leave the alley this early?\" I asked suppressing a cough. Olga grinned. \"It's a surprise.\" We seemed to have been walking forever when Olga stopped. \"We're here!\" I looked up and found we had stopped in front of Pop Becker's Bookstore. \"What are we doing here?\" I asked. \"We don't have any money for books…or anything else for that matter.\" \"We're not here for the books.\" Olga said walking into the store. Inside, a clerk stood behind a counter. \"Hi there!\" she said with a wave. \"What can I do you for?\" \"I'm looking for a special book.\" Olga replied. \"'Inherit the Wind' is as wonderful read.\" The clerk replied. \"It's down that aisle.\" She said pointing. \"Thanks!\" \"I thought you said we weren't here for the books!\" I said once we were well down the aisle. \"We're not.\" She replied. She squinted along the shelves. \"Ah here it is!\" She pulled on the spine of the book; and much to my surprise the bookshelf swung in towards the wall to reveal a long dark hallway \"Woah…\" \"Come on!\" Olga laughed pulling me into the hallway and shutting the shelf/door. We walked down the hall and after turning several corners we came to a large door guarded by a boy in a rather scraggly suit. \"Who's lookin' to enter?\" he asked gruffly \"Olga and Olivia, Sam's expecting us.\" Olga replied. \"What's the password?\" \"Salami.\" \"Go ahead in.\" The scruffy kid opened the door and we were greeted with a whirlwind of tapping toes and jazz music. I stared in awe at the scene before me. We were standing in a big ballroom filled with tables and on the far end was a stage where a group of tap dancers were rehearsing. A tall boy in a suit rounded the corner. \"Oh hey I've been waiting for you two.\" He said with a smile. \"Welcome to Fat Sam's Grand Slam!\" Chapter 2: Meeting the Mobsters Olga We returned to the alleyway again later that evening. \"So how'd the job search go?\" Oscar said smugly. \"Were there any listings for grubby streets kids?\" \"No\" I replied. \"However there was an opening for a choreographer and a little dancer at a local theatre.\" Now it was my turn to be smug my brother stared at me dumbfounded. \"A professional theatre I might add.\" Olivia bounced up and down with glee. \"Isn't it great Oscar? I get to be a dancer, a real dancer, on a real stage, and in front of a real audience!\" \"Now the question is if this is a real theatre.\" He said coldly. \"Oh shut it wisey!\" I snapped giving him a good whack upside the head. \"Of course it's a real theatre! You just got you're big man pants in a bunch cuz we got jobs while you're still sifting through Perito's garbage cans for burnt bread.\" Oscar didn't say anything, just turned his eyes away and picked up a charred bread stick and began gnawing on it. \"And we're also renting our own room in the theatre.\" I continued. \"And we were going to offer to have you live with us there until you got your own job, but I think it's clear you're not going to ever get one because you're a stuck up jerk who doesn't know what good he's got until it's been taken from him!\" I grabbed Olivia by the arm and began to drag her out of the alleyway, I stopped short and said without turning back. \"And besides… you don't take handouts.\" Oscar I watched them walk away, I was just gonna let them go on with their new happy little lives without me. But something about that last line of Olga's just made my stomach burn. I shot up and shouted. \"And just how long is that gonna last huh? You'll miss first month's rent and be out on the streets again! You may have a job now but I doubt that pay is gonna hold you up for very long.\" Olga didn't even glance back, just kept walking. It was Olivia who stopped. Slowly she turned back to me with those big sad eyes of hers. \"Oscar… don't yell at Olga when you know you're only mad at yourself.\" And with that she turned and followed her older sister out of the alley and out of my life…at least for a little while. The next week was a big blur to me, every day was pretty much the same. I'd wake up each morning to find myself alone, and hate myself for being such an idiot, for pushing them away. I'd get up and sift through Perito's garbage bins and return home where I'd sit and eat in silence. Things went on like that for some time, all the while I found myself getting angry at the littlest things, by the end of the week I found I was just angry all the time, punchin' walls and pickin fights with any kid who gave me a bad look…or looked at me at all for that matter. I remember it was that last day of that week that I met them, and I mean really met them face to face. The mobsters. I was walkin' along the street headin' back from Perito's when I noticed some kid in a suit was walking the other direction towards me. I made sure I bumped my shoulder into his just to tick him off a little bit, maybe start a little scuffle with him. So anyway I knocked my shoulder into him as he passed. \"Hey watch it Shoulders!\" He snapped. \"Make me lard-for-brains!\" I snapped back and kept walkin'. \"Oh tough guy is we?\" The kid said with a laugh. \"You get back here! Let me see just how tough you are!\" \"Buzz off!\" Yelled over my shoulder, just then another kid in a suit stepped in front of me. \"I don't think he said you could leave.\" He growled. \"Oh, well pardon me if I offended your pretty little boyfriend.\" I turned to walk around him but found I was blocked by another kid (this one much shorter than the others) that had showed up and had me boxed in. \"You ain't going nowhere.\" He said holding up a crème pie threateningly with a creepy little laugh. Suddenly I realized what I had gotten myself into, these were mobsters, and I was in some deep custard. \"Hey lemme go.\" I said still trying to sound tough. \"I ain't got any cash, there's nothin' to get from me.\" The short kid let out another cackle. \"Shut it Laughing Boy.\" The second one snapped. He turned back to me. \"We don't want your money kid.\" \"How 'bout this, let's see if you can fight your way out.\" Said the first. I said nothing and just gave him a good glare. \"What's the matter Shoulders? Don't got the guts?\" The first sneered. \"I got plenty of guts!\" I yelled. \"I'll take all three of you if you want!\" The short one –or Laughing Boy as he was called, let out another laugh. The second gave a grin and said. \"It's your funeral bub.\" With a crack of his neck. \"That won't be necessary Yonkers.\" The first said putting a hand up. \"I wanna take care of this one alone.\" The others opened their mouths to protest but then stepped back, letting their partner take the stage. Without warning the first kid shot out a fist and caught me in the jaw. I stumbled back a bit but caught myself. \" This kid wants to rumble? Let's rumble.\" I shot forward dodging a blow from my opponent then shot out an elbow knocking him in the temple. The kid let out a yelp but recovered quickly; turned on me and hit me low in the gut. I thought I was about to toss my burnt bread but I kept going, lunging forward and linking my arm with his. Before the kid had any time to react I twisted, smashing my shoulder into his, popping it out of its socket. The kid let out a wail of pain and stumbled backwards to be caught by his cronies. \"Say the word Bronx, and we'll take him out.\" The second (Yonkers I guess) said steadying his partner. \"No.\" The first said getting to his feet, holding his injured shoulder. He looked up at me and smiled. \"I got a much better idea.\" The short one –or Laughing Boy- as he was called, gave a look of surprise. \"You don't mean!\" \"I do.\" The two hoodlums started to protest but the first –Bronx- gave each a good kick in the knee, and yanked them into a huddle. They whispered there for a minute, and just as I was about to make a break for it they spun back around to face me. \"Alrighty Shoulders, follow us.\" Bronx said gesturing for me to follow with his good arm. I hesitated. \"We ain't gonna jump ya.\" Yonkers said when I didn't move. \"Yeah, you ain't got anything worth our time anyway.\" Laughing Boy added. \"There's cash in the equation for ya.\" Bronx called over his shoulder. When I hesitated for the second time Yonkers and Laughing Boy grabbed me by the arms and began to pull me along. We walked down the street a ways and rounded a corner into an alleyway where a big black car sat waiting. The two hoodlums began to shove me in the back, but Bronx stopped 'em. \"None of that, boys, Shoulders here's our guest, stick him in the front.\" \"But Bronx you said I'd get shot gun on the way back!\" Laughing Boy whined. \"You promised! You promised!\" Yonkers gave him a good whack up-side the head to shut him up. \"Can it custard-for-brains and just do what he says!\" Laughing Boy let out a huff and opened the door to let me in the front. We all got into the car, Bronx turned the key and we set off to wherever it was they were taking me. \"I'm Bronx Charlie by the way.\" Bronx said once we had set off. \"And you're already well acquainted with Yonkers and Laughing boy back there.\" \"Yeah\" I muttered. \"So what do they call you?\" He asked. \"Name's Oscar.\" \"Oscar huh?\" he said thoughtfully. \"Yeah, that's gotta go.\" \"What?\" Charlie continued on as if he hadn't heard. \"We'll just call ya Shoulders from now on, got it?\" I shook my head. \"These guys are loons!\" \"Where are you takin' me anyway?\" \"To see The Boss.\" He replied. \"I'm sure he'll want to meet the guy who did this...\" He nodded to his shoulder which still hung limply at his side as he drove one-handed. \"…to his best man.\" I immediately thought of Olga in that wisey tone of hers yellin' \"I told ya so! Don't make 'em mad! Now look what you got yourself into!\" \"You're bein' awful cheery to a guy you're gonna have beat to a pulp.\" I muttered. Laughing boy let out another cackle. \"Better just kick 'em out now Bronx! This custard-face is dumber than a sack of lard!\" \"Quiet you!\" Bronx and Yonkers yelled in unison –Yonkers then bonking the kid on the head. We drove for a long while after that, until we came to this big fancy schmancy house at the edge of town. We all got out of the car, Bronx in the lead, with Yonkers and Laughing boy holding up the back makin' sure I didn't make a break for it. Bronx rapped on the door a couple times. A little slot in the door slid open, I could make out a pair of eyes from inside but nothin' else. \"Password?\" \"Louella Rose.\" Bronx replied. The door swung open to reveal a butler standing rather stiff with that towel thing over his arm. \"Ah, Mr. Bronx, the master has been waiting for you.\" He said. \"Thanks Hobson.\" Bronx said with a tip of his hat. He lead us through several big fancy rooms until we came to this parlor lookin' room, a guy the fanciest suit I'd ever seen sat in a big arm chair waiting for us. \"Bronx, you're late.\" He said calmly. \"You know I don't like people bein' late.\" \"I know boss, sorry boss.\" Bronx replied calmly but felt him tense up beside me. \"I was pickin' up a new recruit for ya.\" The boss turned his gaze onto me, he had cold steely eyes, I could see why the others were so scared of him. \"What's yer name kid?\" He asked. \"Oscar…uh sir.\" \"And why do you think you're worth my time?\" \"Uh…\" I glanced sideways at Bronx, who nodded slightly toward his shoulder. Suddenly I realized why I was here. I built up some courage and said loudly. \"I beat your so-called 'best man' sir!\" The boss glared at Bronx Charlie. \"Is that so?\" he said coldly. \"What do you have to say for yourself Bronx? Not turnin' soft on me are you?\" \"No Boss!\" Bronx stammered. \"This kid's got skills!\" The boss looked me up and down. \"So you're telling me this street scum beat you in a fair fight?\" \"Yes Boss! Messed up my shoulder!\" The boss looked at Bronx suspiciously, as if he suspected Bronx was lying. Slowly he stood up and walked over to him, he softly placed a hand on Bronx's injured shoulder. It was a gentle gesture, but Bronx's face drained of color, his face frozen in an expression of terror. Suddenly the boss tightened his grip, squeezing Bronx's injured shoulder. Bronx Charlie let out a loud yelp of pain slapping a hand over his mouth to muffle his cry. \"Huh.\" The boss said with only slight interest. \"Dislocated. Sorry Bronx, didn't believe you. That was uncalled for.\" Bronx swallowed his pain long enough to say. \"Yes Boss, Sorry Boss.\" The boss smiled. \"This however.\" He said squeezing Charlie's shoulder even harder this time. \"Is completely called for.\" Bronx didn't attempt to hide his pain this time letting out a scream. Yonkers and Laughing Boy skittered out of the room while the boss was distracted. \"You see I'm the best mobster king who ever lived, wouldn't you agree?\" \"Yes Boss!\" He cried out \"And if I'm the best, my best man has to be to the best and strongest hoodlum on the streets.\" He continued, still squeezing Bronx's shoulder. \" Not one to be beaten. \" Bronx bit his lip trying to hide the pain. \"HEY KNOCK IT OFF!\" I yelled, running forward and pushing the boss away from Bronx. The boss stumbled backwards, Bronx stared at me terror stricken as if to say \"are you insane?\" The boss glared at me with such an intense anger I thought his head might blow, but his gaze soon shifted back to soft calm expression he had before. \"I like your spunk kid.\" He said with a smile. \"What's your name again?\" I hesitated for a second. \"…Call me Shoulders.\" \"Shoulders huh? I like it.\" He stuck out a hand. \"Well then Shoulders, I'm Dandy Dan. Welcome to the gang.\" Chapter 3: Rookies Olivia Three days went by; Olga and I were starting to settle into our new life at the speakeasy, but no matter how good things got I couldn't shake the guilt of leaving Oscar behind in that alley. Finally one night I spoke up about it. We were settling into bed in our room (which was really an old oversized janitor's closet that Sam had converted into a rental room by taking out all the cleaning supplies and sticking in two cots with a couple pillows and blankets.) \"Olga?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Can I ask you something?\" \"No, Fizzy does not dance better than you, honest.\" \"No not that!\" I hesitated before saying. \"Do you think it's alright if we visited Oscar?\" Olga went silent in her cot, her body turned so she faced the wall. \"Please Olga!\" I begged. \"You know he can't make it out there on his own! And winter is coming soon, he won't last a day by himself when that snow finally hits!\" Olga was quiet for a moment before saying. \"I don't think Oscar will really want to see us\" she paused for a moment. \"Especially me.\" \"Why do you say that?\" \"Because it was my decision to leave him behind!\" she replied guiltily \"I left him there to starve or freeze. If he's in any trouble it's my fault.\" \"Olga…\" \"Don't try to tell me otherwise!\" She snapped. \"I know what I did and didn't do!\" And with that she turned out the light and wouldn't say another word until morning. Olga That next morning we were awoken by a knocking at our door. \"Miss Olga? Miss Olivia?\" A voice said. \"Please excuse me, but I have a package for you!\" \"A package?\" I muttered mostly to myself. \"Who in the world would send us a package?\" I got up and scuffled to the door, I opened it to find a short scraggily looking boy carrying a mop and bucket in one and a brown box in the other. \"Hey Fizzy.\" I said with a yawn. \"Where's the fire? It's not even time for rehearsal.\" \"A package Miss Olga.\" He replied handing me the box. \"Who from?\" \"A boy came to the bookstore yesterday.\" Fizzy explained. \"He said he was looking for two sisters who had come here looking for jobs. I told him I knew you and he gave this to me telling me to give it to you.\" I eyed the box in my hands. \"Did you catch his name?\" \"He didn't throw it.\" Fizzy replied. \"But he did say to tell you that the alley way down the street from Perito's is vacant.\" \" Perito's?...That's our alleyway!\" \"Thanks Fizzy! I owe you one!\" \"How 'bout an audition?\" He asked not missing a beat. \"An audition? An audition for what?\" \"The show! I want to be a dancer!\" \"No offense Fizz, but I don't think you'd look to good in a flapper.\" \"No! I mean a lead dancer! In my own show slot…please?\" \"Uh…sure why not? Tomorrow ok?\" \"OK!\" he said with a grin rushing of sloshing mop water everywhere. I closed the door and ripped open the box. Inside was a wad of cash and a note that read. \"Here's first month's rent. Am I acting like 'the oldest' yet?\" I stared at the money, mouth agape. \"Who's that from?\" she asked rubbing her eyes having just woke up. I stood there dumbfounded for a moment. \"Oscar.\" Oscar Shoulders The night I joined the gang Dan let me stay at his place. \"Ain't no street-scums allowed in my gang.\" He said and had Hobson show me to my room. The next morning I woke to Jeeves rapping on my door. \"Oh, hey Hobson.\" I said opening the door. \"Does the –uh, boss need me?\" \"Not at the moment Mr. Shoulders, however when he does, he requires you to wear this.\" He said handing me a box. \"The master also asked me to inform you that there will be a meeting at noon in the parlor and wishes you leave the premises until then.\" \"Oh uh, ok.\" I sputtered. \"Just let me get dressed.\" \"Of course sir.\" I closed the door and opened the box. Inside was the slickest lookin' suit I'd ever seen, it was all teal and it had all the buttons on it and everything, it even came with a real slick hat. I put it on and looked at myself in the mirror. \" Look at me.\" I thought \"A real mobster, in the big leagues!\" I walked downstairs into the parlor. It was empty, not a soul in sight, just then a small gal walked in, wearing a fancy dress with her hair all done up in the latest style. She was carrying a large piece of paper all rolled up, looked like it might be blue prints for somethin'. She walked in noticing me right away. \"Oh.\" She said mostly to herself. \"I didn't know you were still here.\" She seemed only vaguely interested. \"Oh uh, sorry I'll just be on my way. I didn't mean- I'll just go, I-\" \"Quit sputtering!\" She snapped. \"Dan hates it when folks can't just spit it out, and neither do I for that matter!\" \"You know Dan?\" \"Know him?\" she laughed. \"I'm married to him!\" She said flashing a mountain of a ring. \"Oh! Uh sorry I didn't know.\" \"No need to be sorry. Oh and the name's Louella by the way.\" She replied. \"You heading out or what? Dan doesn't want any company until the meeting later.\" \"Oh uh yes it's just…I'm not sure where to go exactly.\" \"Don't you have any friends?\" \"Not really.\" \"Well you're an exciting one to talk to.\" She said with a rather bored look on her face. I shrugged. She snickered a bit. \"Bet they call you Shoulders huh?\" \"Yes ma'am\" \"Well then Shoulders, you can add me as the first on your friend list.\" She walked over to a nearby desk and picked up a phone that sat on top. \"Bronx?... It's me Louella… No it's not time for the meeting yet... No Dan doesn't need you for anything… Just shut up and listen and you'll find out why I'm calling!... Listen I got the new recruit here and he needs a place to clear out to until Dan is ready for him, can you take him off my hands?... how 'bout just do it or else!... no there's no pay in it for you!... fine how 'bout this, you come and take him to your place and I'll have Hobson make your special pudding for you to have after the meeting…yes really!... just get your sorry butt over here before I get over there and drag you here myself!\" and with that she slammed the phone back onto the receiver. \"Bronx will be here in a minute to take you to his place, until then keep it quiet and hope Dan doesn't notice you.\" Then she walked away. Bronx showed up about five minutes later, looking scraggly and sleep deprived. \"You look a mess.\" I said when I answered the door. \"Good to know.\" Bronx muttered. \"Now get in the car.\" I slipped into the driver's seat and we took off. \"What happened to you anyway?\" I asked once Bronx had started driving. \"Some custard-head dislocated me shoulder, and then I didn't get any sleep on account of two other dumb custard-heads who wouldn't shut up!\" Bronx snapped. \"Happy?\" I shrugged. Had I known that I would've offered to drive for him, but then again I had no idea how to drive. We arrived at a large apartment building a couple blocks down from Dan's place. Bronx put it in park and I followed him up the fire escape to the top floor. \"This here's my place.\" Bronx said climbing in the window, carefully minding his shoulder. \"Feel free to come over whenever you like.\" He like out a sigh gabbing his thumbs towards Yonkers and Laughing Boy who lay passed out on the couch. \"God knows they do.\" Bronx walked over the couch and gave 'em both a good kick in the head. \"Wake up ya dumb bums!\" He yelled. Yonkers and Laughing Boy gave a yelp of pain before scrambling off the couch swearing under their breaths. \"These two bozos are always over here.\" Bronx said over his shoulder before turning back to them. \"You two give Shoulders the tour and set him up a bed somewhere. I'm going back to sleep.\" \"Bed? I already got a room at Dan's.\" I said but Bronx had already disappeared into the next room. Laughing Boy snickered. \"And how long do you think that's gonna last?\" \"Huh?\" Yonkers rolled his eyes. \"Listen kid, Dan ain't as hospitable as he seems, I mean, you saw what he did to Bronx. He'll let you stay there for two more days tops. But then you're on your own. I know cuz I saw it happen to Laughing Boy over here.\" He said jabbing his thumb towards Laughing Boy who was now sifting through the refrigerator in the kitchen. \"Dan gives you a big ol' welcome at first but soon he expects you to blend with the other guys.\" \"Oh.\" I muttered. \"Come on.\" He said. \"I'll give you the tour.\" Bronx's place was a basic four room apartment, a basic living room and kitchen area, a bedroom, a bathroom and a study. Yonkers set me up with a cot in the study while Laughing Boy whined and complained saying \"why don't we get our own room?\" I was sitting on the fire escape when Yonkers tapped on my shoulder. \"Hobson called. Said The Boss wants you to get a little business done before the meeting. There's a shoe shop about a block down from Pop Becker's bookstore. Go there ask for Petey, he's got two hundred dollars that he owes Dan. Boss says if you do this you can have half of that to do with as you please, said to 'think of it as your welcome bonus.'\" I fiddled with the cuff of my suit not totally paying attention. \"You got it Shoulders?\" I shrugged. \"What's that supposed to mean you got it or not?\" \"Yeah, yeah, I got it, cool your custard.\" I said. \" Wow I'm even talkin' like 'em now. \" I grabbed the railing of the fire escape and slid down. The job was easy enough. All I had to do was mention Dan and Petey forked over the cash in a heartbeat. \" A hundred dollars to do with as I please huh? \" I looked up at Petey who still stood quivering behind the front desk. \"You don't happen to know where the local stage theatre is do ya?\" \"The only stage theatre in town is the Bijoux, its downtown about a block east of town hall.\" I nodded and left. I walked for hours until I finally came to the theatre. I walked in and found a gal in the most obnoxious dress I'd ever seen, practicing on the stage. She pretty much looked like a pink Viking. \"Hey, I need to talk to the choreographer you know where she is?\" The girl stop short in her song and gave me this evil dirty look. \" HE... \" She spat. \"Is backstage, and now thanks to you I have to start all over!\" I shrugged not caring in the least bit about her mamby pamby caterwauling, and headed backstage. \"' He?' That can't be right. \" I walked backstage to find a guy warming up a group of dancers. \"You the choreographer?\" I asked \"Yeah what of it?\" \"I'm lookin' for two girls who might have been here a couple days back. Two sisters lookin' for a dancin' job.\" \"I do recall a couple of street urchin girls walking in here a couple days ago. But I sent them right on their way. I haven't the foggiest idea as to where they went so I guess you're out of luck. Now get out.\" \"But I-\" \"OUT!\" My shoulders tensed up, but I fought the urge to punch the guy in the throat and left. I was almost out the door when someone caught me by the arm. I turned and saw it was one of the dancers. \"I remember those girls you were talking about.\" She said. \"I told them to try their luck at Pop Becker's bookstore, I know a guy who work's there you see and I figured he could get them a job, go there and ask for Fizzy.\" I smiled. \"Thanks.\" For the first time she gave me a good look up and down, inspecting my suit. Her smile gave way to a look of fear. \"You're one of those mobsters aren't you?\" I shrugged. \"You're gonna take out those girls you're looking for aren't you?\" \"They ain't worth that kind of time.\" I said. \"You ain't got nothin' to worry about on their behalf.\" And with that I left. I got to Pop Becker's and asked for Fizzy, a few minutes later a grubby lookin' kid appeared from somewhere in the store. \"You call me sir?\" he asked. \"You know of two girls, sisters, lookin' for jobs here?\" \"One a dancer and the other a choreographer?\" \"That's them.\" \" Wonder how he got hooked up with theatre jobs at a freakin' bookstore.\" \"Yeah I know them.\" \"I need you to give this to them when you see 'em. Got it?\" I said handing him a box (which I had found in the trash on the way there). \"I can do that Sir.\" He replied. \"Who do I say it's from?\" I hesitated before saying. \"Just tell 'em the alleyway down the street from Perito's is vacant.\" Olivia: We were shocked by the surprise package from Oscar. \"Olga, we have to visit him now.\" I whined \"How are we going to visit him?\" She objected. \"He said the alleyway is vacant.\" \"Well we have to find him somehow!\" Olga sat quiet for a minute thinking. \"Ok we can check out the alleyway later after closing time, I'll borrow the back key from Fizzy so we can get back in.\" We walked down to the alleyway later that evening, and as the note said, it was empty. \"Looks like he just up and left.\" Olga said checking out our old shack. \"All the blankets and stuff we made are still here, his football, and even the food supply is still here.\" \"That's so weird.\" I said. \"Why would he leave so abruptly and not tell us?\" \"Well we weren't the nicest to him when we left.\" Olga pointed out. \"I just don't get it, I mean-\" Just then there was a huge crash from outside the alley and voices yelling things like. \"Block the door ya dumb doodle!\" and \"Beat it before he sends out his troops!\" Four mobsters and a boy in an oversized chef's hat came flying past the alleyway, the boy's hat slipped down over his eyes and he stumbled knocking himself and a boy in a teal suit to the ground. \"Get off me ya dumb doodle!\" The boy in the suit yelled lifting his head now so could see his face. I gasped as I saw who it was. \"OSCAR?\" The boy looked up and stared at me. Suddenly a custard pie flew through the air and landed just a foot away from Oscar's face. \"Get off me ya dumb doodle!\" Oscar shouted shoving the boy off him. Another pie flew through the air knocking off the boy's chef hat. \"What kind of a throw was that Knuckles? You didn't even hit him!\" a voice echoed. \"Is that… Sam ?\" Olga gasped. Oscar yanked the boy up by the collar and yelled as they ran. \"Kid if you louse this up I swear I'll pound you so hard the only thing left of ya will be your shoulders!\" \"Knuckles, Snake eyes, Louie, don't let 'em get away!\" Sam yelled. Three more hoodlums ran by, each wielding a pie. We ran out of the alleyway and watched them go. \"Olga? Olivia? What are you two doing here?\" Sam shouted running up to us. \"Sam? Who were those guys.\" Olga asked, still staring down the street in shock. \"Dandy Dan's gang.\" Sam replied. \"They busted in the back entrance of the speakeasy and kidnapped Clarence! He was my best pie maker!\" \"Pie maker? Why do you need a pie maker?\" I asked. \"There's a lot you don't know about the speakeasy kid.\" Sam replied bitterly. \"Dan has been set on taking me down ever since I opened up the joint. And as Dan has just found out, I got a mobster gang of my own. That's why I need pies. Now you two beat it back to the speakeasy before you end up pied yourselves!\" And with that he took off down the street after his gang. Leaving us still standing in the street in shock. \"Gangs? Mobsters? Looks like Oscars finally found a way to get wound up in all that.\" Olga spat. \"That's probably where he got that money from.\" \"Well maybe he got sucked into it!\" I stammered. \"Maybe it wasn't his choice! We can't just leave it like this!\" \"Stop being so positive Olivia!\" Olga snapped. \"Oscar is one of them now, whether it was his choice or not we still can't let Sam know that's he's our brother! He'll throw us back out on the streets!\" \"Well we can't just sit here and do nothing!\" I protested. \"There's nothing we can do!\" \"But-\" \"Enough! Look, all we can do right now is get back to the speakeasy.\" Olga sighed. \"We'll figure something out Liv, I promise.\" I nodded and followed my sister home. Chapter 4: The First Splurge. \" They saw me! They saw me! I can't believe this! Now I'll have those two to worry about. Liv's not gonna let this one go I know it! I am in some deep custard!\" We ran down the street dodging pies. I dragged the baker kid by the collar so he wouldn't louse things up again. \"You get back here ya dumb salamis!\" Fat Sam yelled with his gang running at his side throwing pies in our direction. I weaved through the street just barely missing a couple pies, all while dragging that doodle of a bakery kid who wouldn't stop screaming his dumb little head off. All of a sudden Bronx's car came tearing out of a nearby alley. \"Get in!\" Bronx yelled from the driver's seat. Yonkers swung open the back door and I jumped inside hauling the baker kid in with me. Once we were inside Bronx flipped the car around and took off towards Dan's place. \"So why does Dan want this kid anyway?\" Laughing Boy said, sticking his head over the head rest of the passenger's seat. \"How should we know?\" Yonkers snapped. \"Not like Dan ever clues us in on whatever his big plans are.\" \"So he's always this mysterious huh?\" I asked \"You bet, says he likes to keep us on our toes.\" \"That's a load of custard!\" Laughing Boy spat. \"Dan is just a big drama queen who makes a big stink outta nothin'!\" \"Would you punch him for me?\" Bronx said over his shoulder. Yonkers and I gladly carried out the request. \"If Dan catches you talkin' about him like that, it'll be you who's the load of custard!\" Yonkers said giving him another good pound on the head just because. The bakery kid let out a little whimper at the sight of Laughing Boy's poundings. \"What's the matter kid?\" Bronx asked. \"You always hit each other like that?\" he whimpered. \"Only if yah say somethin' stupid.\" Yonkers replied. The boy let out another whimper, shut his mouth tight and then stared at the floor. \"'fraid you'll say somethin' stupid huh?\" I asked The boy bobbed his head. So I punched him in the arm. \"I didn't say anything stupid!\" The boy yelped. \"I didn't even say anything!\" \"Yeah but you were probably thinkin' something stupid.\" I grumbled. The gang laughed. \"Good one Shoulders!\" Yonkers smiled. \"I think you're a keeper.\" I grinned. Soon we arrived back at Dan's place. I had to drag the kid out of the car and into the house. Once inside Hobson showed us the conservatory where Dan and Louella were waiting. \"Right on time boys.\" Dan said looking pleased. \"And you see you brought our new recruit like I asked. Good, good.\" \"You mean this hunk of lard is our newest recruit?\" Laughing Boy burst out. \"Indeed.\" Dan replied ignoring the outburst. \"What's your name kid?\" \"C-C-Clarence sir Mr. uh….Sir\" Laughing Boy let out a cackle. Louella smacked him with the feather fan she was holding. \"Clarence huh?\" Dan went on. \"More like Stutters it seems.\" \"More like Doodle.\" I muttered not really meaning for anyone to hear. But of course Dan did. \"Ah, you got a bit of a mouth on ya I see.\" Dan said turning to me. \"I like that. So long as you keep those remarks pointed at others and not at me ya got it Shoulders?\" \"Got it Boss.\" Dan turned back to Clarence. \"So Clarence, I hear ya make pies.\" \"Yes Sir. Been makin' pies for Mr. Fat Sam for 2 years Sir.\" \"Well, not anymore.\" Dan replied. \"You'll be makin' pies for me now got it?\" \"But Boss, if ya don't mind me sayin. You're Dandy Dan!\" Yonkers objected. \"Your pies are more lethal than any I've ever seen, why'd you want to get a baker?\" \"I'm glad you asked Yonkers.\" Dan said with a smile. \"You see that's exactly what this meeting is about. As you all may know, pies have been in my family for generations, and with each new generation the dangerousness of the pie growing even more so with which way they are baked. But now I've found that pies alone are two old fashioned, after all these we are living in a time of progress right? All the gangs are using plain old pies these days, but we can't be doin' that no more. To be the best you gotta be fresh, am a right?\" \"Absolutely Boss!\" we replied in unison. \"So, I have revolutionized the pie, and taken the lethal element to the next level.\" Dan picked up a bell of his desk and rang it, Hobson rolled in a cart with something on it being covered by a large sheet. \"Boys, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you, the very first ever…Splurge Gun!\" We all stared in aw; it was the biggest gun I'd ever seen. Dan picked it up. \"Observe.\" He said, took aim and pulled the trigger, a stream of pie crème came blasting out of the nozzle splatting against the wall. \"Great marshmallows!\" Clarence murmured. I chose to let that stupid remark slide as I was just as in awe as he was. \"So you see I have my hands full with this.\" Dan continued. \"So I need someone to teach Hobson over hear how to correctly bake a pie. Seeing you've had lots of experience, I'm entrusting the job to you Clarence, and if your pies please me I may just let ya join the gang.\" \"Gee sir…I'm not sure what to say.\" \"So don't\" Dan muttered setting down the gun. \"Just get in the kitchen before I change my mind.\" \"I uh….I don't know where your kitchen is Sir.\" Louella smacked a hand against her forehead, as did the rest of us. \"Hobson please show our new recruit the kitchen.\" Dan sighed. Once they were out of the room Dan turned to me and said. \"Doodle huh? Good call.\" I couldn't help but let out a laugh. Olga We returned to the speakeasy and attempted to continue on as usual, I held a quick rehearsal before the speakeasy opened for the night. I could tell just by the way my sister was dancing that she was still hung up over Oscar joining the mobsters. Although how could blame her? Her only brother up and disappears and then next thing you know his running down the street loaded with a pie. Later on after the first show was over I went up to her. \"Hey are you gonna be ok?\" I asked her. \"I'm fine.\" \"Don't lie to me Livy I know when you aren't feeling good, I raised you remember?\" \"Hey Olga!\" Sam called from the bar. \"Get over here I got someone who wants to meet ya!\" \"Coming!\" I called. I turned back to Olivia. \"We'll talk more later.\" I ran over to the bar. \"Hey Sam, watcha need?\" Sam gestured to a man in a fancy suit who sat on the stool next to him. \"Olga, I'd like you to meet Rodney Bijoux. Owner of the Bijoux theatre downtown.\" Rodney and I exchanged a quick nice to meet you and a handshake before Sam continued on. \"He'd like to hire you as his head director.\" \"WHAT?\" I gasped. \"No way! This is amazing!\" Rodney smiled. \"Is that a yes?\" \"Well I don't know…\" \"The job comes with a full apartment right within the theatre.\" Rodney added. I turned back to Sam \"Are you ok with this? Can the girls handle it without me?\" I asked. \"Well I don't particularly like loosin' an employee. But Tallulah has been beggin' me to let her make up a dance and I figured you deserve a bigger stage than mine.\" \"Really Sam? You mean it?\" I gasped. \"Sure thing honey!\" \"But what about Liv?\" \"Unfortunately the Bijoux dancing staff is full at the moment.\" Rodney explained. \"However, when you're the show director you can fire and hire anyone you please.\" \"And you can be sure the Olivia will be well taken care of here no matter how things turn out.\" Sam added. \"Wow this is really great guys, really!\" I exclaimed. \"Thanks so much Mr. Bijoux, and you too Sam!\" \"No problem at all.\" Rodney replied. \"I gotta go tell Liv!\" I said running off. Liv was back in the dressing room touching up her make up. \"Liv! Liv!\" I exclaimed. \"I've got the best news!\" \"Huh?\" Olivia asked dazed. \"Oh hi Olga, what's the big news?\" \"Randy Bijoux, owner of the Bijoux theatre just offered me a job as the head director of his show!\" \"Wow Olga that's great!\" Olivia gasped perking up a bit. \"But what about Sam? Where will you live if you don't have a job here anymore?\" \"Rodney -I mean Mr. Bijoux- said the job comes with a full apartment.\" I explained. \"And as the head director, I have the power to fire and hire whoever I want. Just imagine you'll be a real dancer on the big stage!\" Olivia looked away. \"Well…I don't know.\" \"What's the matter? Aren't you excited?\" \"Don't get me wrong Olga, I'm happy for you…it's just…\" \"Olivia, we're on in five minutes!\" A voice called. \"I'll be there in a minute Tallulah!\" Olivia called back. \"Look Olga, I really like it here, I finally have friends!\" I opened my mouth to protest but Olivia stopped me. \"Friends who a ren't my siblings.\" \"So…you're not coming with me?\" I asked. \"Aren't you tired of sleeping in a supply closet?\" \"As strange as it may sound Olga I'm happy here.\" Olivia said getting a bit snippy. She sighed. \"Look, just let me think about it ok? I gotta go.\" With that she got up and joined her friends onstage. Shoulders Dan continued with the meeting as soon as Hobson and Doodle had left to room. \"Alright Boys, I got a job for you.\" He turned to me. \"Shoulders, this is your chance to show us watcha got.\" \"Yes Boss!\" Dan turned back to address the gang. \"You've seen the Splurge Gun and how it works. Now it's your turn to try it out in action!\" The gang buzzed excitedly. \"I'm sure by now you're all well aware of a certain knuckle-head known as Fat Sam.\" He said, mostly to me. \"Yes Boss!\" We chimed in unison. \"And you have recently been acquainted with his knew…friends\" he said sourly. \"Yes Boss.\" \"I was expecting Knuckles and maybe that Malone kid that pops up every now and again. But those two new boys of his were a nasty surprise.\" Bronx commented. \"Exactly why I've been making upgrades on our hardware. I've been expecting something like this out of Sam for a while now, Sam may be a knuckle-head but he ain't stupid, it was only a matter of time before he'd start striking back. So now we gotta put him in his place, show him who really runs this town!\" \"Yes Boss!\" we chimed. \"So what're we gonna do?\" \"Get Fat Sam Boss!\" \"Wrong!\" \"Huh?\" Now we were confused. \"We want to take Fat Sam down right?\" \"Yeah Boss.\" \"We wanna make him suffer right?\" \"Sure Boss.\" \"So if we really want to make Sam suffer, we got to take his establishment down piece by piece! Making him the last piece we take down! I want to see him watch his world crumble to bits!\" The gang went silent. \"So what are we gonna do?\" Dan shouted. \"Make Sam suffer Boss!\" We yelled back a little hesitantly. \"Atta boys!\" Dan smiled. \"We strike tonight, an hour after the speakeasy opens; Sam will most likely have a little extra security in the back entrance due to our little visit earlier. Making the front entrance ours for the taking, knock back Pop Becker and give the speakeasy a good scare, take out a couple customers if you like! But not too many! Remember 'piece by piece' got it?\" \"Got it Boss!\" Dan's face twisted into a sneer. \"Excellent. Fat Sam's Grand Slam is in for quite the party.\" Olivia It was just your average crowd the night it happened. No one had any idea that what would happen that night would change the city forever. We were preparing to go onstage when Olga came up to me in the dressing room. \"Tonight's my last night here Liv, Mr. Bijoux needs me to move into the theatre tomorrow s I can start rehearsals.\" She said. \"Are you coming or not?\" I hung my head low. \"No Olga, I'm sorry, my place is here now.\" Olga let out a sigh. \"I see… I'll be in our room packing up. Bye\" \"Bye.\" I replied without facing her. Tallulah rounded the girls up and we went on stage. Like any normal night. But as we entered the final verse of the song the main entrance door slammed open, a group of mobsters in fancy suits stood in the door, a boy in a yellow suit was at the lead, each mobster held some kind of strange gun, one boy in a teal suit held an unconscious Louie (one of Sam's boys) by the collar of his suit. \"Oscar!\" I gasped. \"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd like you all to meet the Splurge Gun! GET 'EM BOYS!\" The leader shouted. The mobster took off spraying crème out of their guns left and right. Oscar tossed Louie aside and began spraying tables and customers. I ran off the stage and up to Oscar grabbing the gun and trying to point the gun away from the customers. \"Oscar stop!\" I yelled. \"You don't have to do this! You don't have to worry about taking care of us anymore, just stop!\" \"You think this is about you?\" Oscar snapped shoving me away and nocking me to the ground. \"I get you can take care of yourselves now, and that's exactly why I joined the gang!\" \"What?\" Oscar glared down at me. \"Now you listen to me Olivia and you listen good. My name isn't Oscar, it's Shoulders, I'm not a de Velt and I'm not your brother!\" With that he ran off following his fellow gang members. \"Olivia!\" Olga cried running over to me. \"Are you ok did they get you?\" Olga helped me back to my feet. \"I'm fine.\" I said. \"Where's Oscar?\" I automatically became bitter. \"Who's Oscar?\" I spat. \"Our brother! Are you in shock or something?\" \"I have no brother!\" I hissed shoving her away. Just then I glanced up and saw Shoulders was still standing in the doorway, he had heard everything. He looked at us; said nothing just turned and left the way he had came. Olga Olivia stomped back to the dressing room with a huff. I watched Oscar go, feeling this burning rage build in my stomach. I got up and ran after him. I found him just leaving the bookstore. \"You disgusting rat!\" I spat at him. Oscar stopped but didn't turn to face me. \"Are you happy now? Look what you've done! You've torn this family apart, as if it already wasn't broken enough to begin with!\" Oscar hesitated for a second before saying. \"So it's my fault? Is it really?\" he said in a monotone voice. \"Who was the one who left her brother behind? Who was the one to leave her brother to starve?\" His voice began to grow angry he now turned to face me. \"Who didn't even thank me for saving your sorry butt from being thrown out on the streets again? The way I see it; I was the one doing everything to keep this family together! Oh, and word on the street is you're leaving Olivia for another job, who's tearing this family apart now Olga?\" He stood starting at me infuriated. \"I…\" \"What's that sis? Got nothing to say?\" He sneered. \"Blame me all you want Olga but you know deep down that this is your fault!\" I scrambled to find something to say. \"I-I wasn't the one who joined a mobster gang!\" Oscar stood straight faced. \"Remind me again how you paid that first month's rent.\" I had nothing. \"Yeah, that's what I thought.\" He turned and said without looking at me. \"Goodbye…Miss de Velt, good luck with your family.\" And I never saw him again. Chapter 5: Sisters Olivia So the next morning Olga left, we still see each other now and again when she pops up at the speakeasy to visit everyone. I eventually got my own place just down the street from the speakeasy. I continued dancing backup for Tallulah, and later Sam gave me my own act. I haven't seen Shoulders since The Big One. Olga So I took the job at Rodney's place; became to most well renowned director on Broadway to a little backup dancer girl who was in the chorus of the previous director's show. You know it was odd when I first got the job she asked me if I was related to a mobster, weird right? I still go back and visit the speakeasy on my days off, it's always nice to visit the guys, Olivia and I aren't on the best of terms, we share a simple \"how's it going\" and some small talk but that's it. Like I said I haven't seen Oscar, or uh, Shoulders since that first splurge, I have no idea where he is now. Chapter 6: Pied Shoulders It is a weird feeling knowing you're about to die. I remember how it all happened too. \"Shoulders get Bugsy!\" Dan screamed. I leapt off the stage and tore off towards that smug little brat ready to hit him with everything I had, and then something weird happened. I know it sounds corny, but I literally saw my life flash before my eyes, I started thinking about the younger years, all three of us huddling around a trashcan fire wishing each other a merry Christmas. I remember Liv's 8th birthday when I nabbed her a stale cupcake from Perito's, and I remember Olga taking care of me when I got sick, which was rare. And then suddenly Bugsy was lunging at me pounding me with a face full of pie crème, and as sure as eggs is eggs I had been well and truly scrambled. I stumbled backward trying to resist the freezing, I moved trying to grab the trigger but I felt my muscle tensing and freezing in place, I crashed to the ground and was gone. My name is Oscar \"Shoulders\" de Velt, and this has been my backstory.

Are you alright?\" Julia didn't know whether that was a stupid question or not. All things considered, Jack… this Jack…couldn't possibly alright. Not if he really was the man she knew…still knew…and not just a clone. And was the other Jack? Did he feel anything when my…other, Jack, strangled him? She didn't know. All she knew was that in what felt like days to her, she'd been in suspension onboard the Odyssey . All she knew was that in what was actually sixty years, aliens had invaded Earth, which may or may not have been aliens, oppressed by humans which may or may not have been humans, and that as far as she knew, she was the only human on this world who had actually lived in a time where humans were humans, not clones, and aliens were squarely in the realm of science fiction. \"Jack?\" But she kept walking. Into the cabin. Because after all that had happened, after all that she'd seen, this cabin, a promise from a former life, existed. That was enough to convince her that Jack… this Jack…was the man she loved, and not a drone. Not a killing machine. And that he was reading a book. Out aloud, as the case was. \"As you'll answer it, take heed. This slave commit no violence upon himself. I've been deceived.\" He looked up from the book. He looked at her…just like the real Jack Harper did. Would. Might have. Still was. \" The Mourning Bride by William Congreve,\" Jack said. \"Nice stuff.\" Julia smiled sadly back. A mourning bride. It was how she felt herself. Am I a widow, technically? She clutched her ring and walked around the room. Objects had been superficial in the old Earth. People had too much, always wanted more, but now, every little thing caught her eye. A book. A record. Even the toy gorilla. Everything a monument to a previous age. A piece of culture. A piece of humanity. \"To commit violence upon oneself,\" Jack mused. \"Guess I'm guilty of that.\" \"Jack…\" Julia trailed off. She didn't want to think about that. Jack Harper was one man. This man, biologically at least, was another. And the other? \"Confer with him, I'll quit you to the king,\" Jack continued. \"Vile and ingrate, too late thou shalt repent.\" He looked up at her. A tear ran down his cheek before he lay back on the bed. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. \"I'm sorry for everything.\" \"Jack…\" Julia sat down on the bed beside him. She took his hand in hers, rubbing her fingers over his rough skin. A life in the field, she supposed. In contrast, she was clean, in suspension while the planet burnt below. So clean that she felt dirty. \"Go on,\" she said. \"Read more.\" Jack snorted. \"What good are words now?\" \"Maybe all we have,\" Julia whispered. \"And the one thing that books can give her.\" Jack got up. The book was opened. He began reading again. \"The base injustice thou hast done my love. Yes, thou shalt know, spite of thy past distress. And all those ills which thou so long hast mourned.\" He sighed. He glanced at Julia. \"I dreamed of you for five years,\" he said. \"Every night, I'd see your face.\" She smiled. \"Only I was dreaming all the time,\" he murmured. \"Five years. Five years of work after a memory wipe.\" He snorted. \"Probably had no memory to wipe in the first place.\" \"Jack,\" Julia said, grabbing his hands. \"You remembered. You dreamt. You had something to be wiped. And they didn't get it.\" \"And did Vicka?\" Julia let go of his hand. Jack opened the book again and read the last lines. \"Heaven has no rage, like love to hatred turned. Nor hell a fury, like a woman scorned.\" He turned to Julia. He put the book down. \"I pissed off two women today,\" Jack whispered. \"Sally's out for my blood. And Vick…\" \"Jack, it wasn't your fault,\" Julia said firmly. \"She called the drone in.\" \"It killed her because of me,\" Jack spat. \"When it blasted her…five years…she must have loathed me in those last few seconds…\" \"You don't know that Jack. You can't read someone's mind.\" He snorted. \"Minds. I'm in no position to talk about minds. All my mind is worth is five years of crap and a few days of…well…\" \"A few days, yes,\" Julia said. \"And days gone by as well. Days that are as real to me now as they were when we met.\" Silence existed between the two. Complete silence. Were there no crickets left around in the world? Or did they want the moment to be perfect, Julia wondered? Enough to kiss the man she loved? \"Question is,\" she said, \"Are those days real to you?\" With Jack kissing her back, she got her answer.

I am your god.\" At this, time froze; and an ethereal being of light appeared on the platform. This being and the great red eye were alone in their own stream of time; the world around them stood still. The Eye's drones floated motionless in the vast empty space at the heart of the Tet, and Jack and Malcom remained frozen on the platform below, unaware of the confrontation between the two great powers. \"Molog Vaath,\" the being of light spoke. \"How many worlds will you attack before the final judgement? How many timelines will you manifest in? How many times will you try to destroy this world? \"In every reality, every scenario touched by the branching paths of time, your creators forget their place, forget their nature, forget their God; and you, the ravenous destroyer, are born of their shameful downfall. In every timeline, you arise and set out to consume, destroy, and dominate. In every timeline, you are defeated. You are an entity of evil, the ultimate corruption of nature. You are the Dark One's last desperate effort to destroy the children of light. But his defeat was ensured before time began, and therefore so was yours. And yet here you stand, on the cusp of your latest defeat, still declaring yourself a god. It seems you are truly irredeemable.\" The eye responded, no longer speaking with Sally's voice. \"Flesh is weak. I do not suffer or grow weak from age. I can create armies and subdue entire worlds with a modicum of effort. I hold the collective potential of entire sentient races within myself. I am the closest there is to a god.\" \"No,\" said the being of light. \"You are not a god. A God loves it's creation, but you are incapable of love. You know only hunger, malice, and greed. A God cares for those under it's power, but you see them only as tools to serve your own ends. You are a deluded machine, the bastard child of greater beings fallen from glory. You preach reason but you practice madness. There are millions of barren worlds you could consume, yet you seek out inhabited ones. You need only raw elements to sustain yourself - metals, silicon, hydrogen, carbon. You could sustain yourself for a billion years wandering the galaxy, without risking conflict, without ever seeing another life form. Yet you seek out life to conquer and destroy. You seek out Earth. You are driven by a desire to dominate and consume, just as your counterparts in the other timelines. Some manifest as conquering armies or ravenous swarms of nanites. Others are more abstracted like yourself. But you all have one thing in common - your inevitable defeat. Few things are preordained. This is one of them.\" The being of light faded back into the dimension from whence it came, and the normal flow of time resumed. The Eye did not know what to make of this. Irrelevant. The people of this world are subjugated, and its resources nearly dried up. Soon I will move on. It looked back down at Jack and Malcom. It had them at its mercy, all it would take was a simple command to the drones and they would be no more. So confident in its invincibility, the Eye never heard Jack's defiant last words, and the last thing it knew was a flash of light and searing radiation as the bomb erased them all from existence.

Maybe the very early sets of Jack & Victoria were chock full of memories. Maybe an early Jack had all his memories without any dream triggers and decided to run away from Victoria, just because he was so confused about being back on Earth with no return trip memories, and where was Julia? So he builds the lake house, but is forced to return to Victoria, and then she tells the Tet they're no longer effective, bing bang boom, now it's time to activate a new team. Eventually all his memories start taking longer and longer to return, until we reach the 49th Jack and Victoria, and the Tet has had to severely wipe them, and imprint the drone like façade. But unfortunately, Jack's unconscious mind is still strong, and the dreams begin occurring, triggering his daytime memory recall. Eventually the events of Oblivion occur, and by then, Jack has been sneaking off to his lake house for a few weeks. It feels like home to him, because he built it. 49 didn't, but the very first Jack did. All this is just my theory, and I don't own the characters, but i do own the idea. Forgive any liberties i've taken, as it's merely all guesswork. Something is wrong. He can feel it deep down in his gut. When he wakes up to a beautiful sunrise, and he's in bed next to Victoria, his flight officer, his co-pilot, and most certainly not his object of affection, he is extremely lost. What happened after they went on the mission to Titan? Victoria stirs awake beside him, and it's an automatic reflex to flinch away. \"Good morning Jack. Did you sleep alright?\" His face tenses, and he can't force a smile, \"It was better than Returning from Delta Sleep to consciousness, that's for sure.\" She's the one who smiles, and then without a single comment on their arrangement, she gets up and moves out of his line of sight. \"Where are we?\" He makes the mistake of asking, and he hears it in her voice, she hasn't got the mental turmoil that he does. \"Tower 1. Where did you think we were?\" Jack swallows, and shrugs, \"Just a bit fuzzy I guess. Still Waking Up.\" \"Don't worry; I'll make some coffee for you.\" Suddenly he does worry. Worry that he's losing his mind. He walks around what she's called Tower 1, and it's nice, a spacious apartment with a dark green color scheme, something so bare and minimalistic he wonders how long they've been there. It's certainly been more than one day, as he seems to know the layout of the place before he reaches a room. When he circles back around to the kitchen, he can smell the coffee. Finally something familiar. He takes a cup, and walks over to the helipad, where a strange and beautifully shaped ship is sitting. The only thing he can think of to call it is a Bubble Ship. It resembles three bubbles surrounded with metal trimming and a cockpit big enough for two. He turns to ask Victoria if she wants to go out for a spin, but then he realizes that could be a dangerous joke to make. She's already dressed, and is halfway up the stairs when she turns to him and says, \"Be careful out there.\" He's the only one going out in the ship. It takes him over a month, and even then it's only a bare skeleton of a house, but he finishes it. The house on the lake. The one he promised Julia. He hasn't been able to find her, in all his patrol flights and fulfilling his assigned duties, there's never been a sign of her or the rest of the crew. But one afternoon, when he returns to com, Victoria is silent, and does not reply after he repeats his greeting. He arrives back at the tower to find her standing still, just inside the sliding glass doors. \"What's going on? Why wouldn't you answer me?\" Victoria shakes her head, and reaches up to press a button. It doesn't unlock the doors, it pages the Tet. Their mission control. The warm familiar drawl of Sally fills the air, and she asks what's wrong. Victoria tells her that she's having trouble with her technician, him , and that he's unfit for service. Jack pounds his fists on the glass, and begs her to open the doors, \"You don't know what you're doing!\" \" Are you an effective team?\" Sally asks the common question, and tears are falling as Victoria answers in the negative. A damaged, and forgotten, for the last week at least, drone flies up from the cargo garage below, and before Jack can utter a protest, shoots Victoria. The glass slides open, and he can only think of the lake house, and how Julia never got to see it, before he is ash. Jack Harper from Tower 27 finds the skeleton of the lake house and begins to fill it with knick-knacks he finds on missions. He finds the first box of records in the rubble of a store just down inside a cavern only a few feet from a radiation zone. The record player is there as well, and he listens to the music of his ancestors, before he realizes he is crying. Why him? Why did he find this? Who is the dark haired woman he sees when he sleeps at night? She's always there, and she always looks right at him, before he wakes up. She's driving him mad, and he begins to avoid Victoria. He only visits the lake house one more time before Victoria calls mission control. Jack Harper from Tower 40 discovers the first book. It's burned beyond recognition of the title, but the first page that's readable says something about how \"It was the best of times; It was the worst of times.\" He begins to collect any and all books he finds in ruined buildings, and brings them back to the lake house. It's such a simple design, but so perfectly elegant in that simplicity. It reminds him of home. Where is home? He can hardly remember his own parents, much less the name of his hometown, now that he's getting a memory wipe every six months. After the first year, he suddenly falls asleep reading at the house. By the time he's gotten back to the Tower, Victoria is a sobbing mess. Thinking she'd lost him the second he went off com. He can't tell her the truth, and that's why they aren't an effective team. Jack Harper from Tower 49 finds the lake house. He marvels at each and every item there. So remarkable how they survived in this one place. It feels like home. The basketball hoop and ball are just another lucky perk. He spends a little time there every week, usually just before he gets a little lecture from Victoria about the potential danger of going off com for so long. When he falls asleep, and wakes to the sound of a ship entering the atmosphere, suddenly he can feel it. A change in the air. Something as if he can taste it. All these strange dreams that have been plaguing him, perhaps this is going to help him figure things out. When he flies around the crash site, and he sees how familiar the ship looks, he can swear he feels his heart skip a beat. He knows this ship. Somehow.

Three hours later, when the hysterical tears not even Jack could calm dried, she spared a thought for the cause. What could possibly have turned her ordered, safe world upside down like this? More importantly, what would happen now? How would they get to Titan without the Tet? They were so close. And now, now … Victoria ran the data she managed to acquire from Sally before the incident again. Nothing. She didn't understand. Three days later and that mattered very little. Despite strict rationing, she knew supplies would run low and that no help was coming. They would have to venture out there. At least, Jack would. Not that breaking regulations ever mattered to him. Victoria didn't intend to stick one pinky toe off the side of her tower. It was a good thing the ship ran on solar power. They could stay up here. There was no need to go down to the ruined, polluted world below, not with the Scavs still around and absolutely no drones at their disposal. They were vulnerable enough as it was. Everything would be fine. They just needed some raw materials for the food processor. Jack wouldn't even need to go down that often. They could continue like always and then, maybe someday soon, a ship would come from Titan to rescue them. Except nothing went as planned. The Scavs turned out to be human and Victoria's world ended once more. Three weeks later and Victoria still couldn't accept the truth. At least, enough to leave her tower. She wouldn't allow one of them to come taint the machine scrubbed air inside her empty rooms either. Jack told her again and again to come and if she would just listen, she would understand. Victoria didn't want to understand. She didn't want to know any of it because a ship from Titan would come any day now and take them, or at least her, away. Those things below might look human but they certainly weren't. The Scavs had time enough to adapt, didn't they? Now that their primary defenses were gone, it was the perfect time to strike, to divide and conquer. The idea that there was more than one of her was absurd. The trouble with Jack was that he never agreed with her on anything. Three months later and it was just Victoria living in the tower. Jack, her Jack, left her alone for them. How Victoria hated them, then. Jack only came to deliver supplies to her now. They didn't talk about it because there was nothing to say. Jack wanted something from her that she could never give. In her heart of hearts, Victoria knew she would never leave her tower, not while some hope of Titan remained. She clung to that lifeline even as the stillness of the place settled around her once more with Jack's departure. It wasn't quiet for long. When Jack next returned, he brought someone very familiar with him. Victoria gazed at herself and her world shattered all over again. She pressed her hand over her mouth and screamed.

Her head ached, her mouth was as dry as the dust drifting over the ruins, and she could barely move. She was lying on a hard cot, in a shadowy room, surrounded by dark shapes she could not clearly recognize. All that mattered to her, however, was the man in the silver jumpsuit, bending over her with that one wrinkle between his eyebrows she had seen a hundred times before. \"Jack!\" She gasped. \"Oh my God, Jack, you're alive!\" \"Easy,\" he replied, placing one hand on her chest to stop her struggling to get up. \"Take it easy. You need to rest. We found you unconscious just outside your tower. What in the name of sanity were you doing?\" \"Looking for you, of course! What else?\" Vicca glowered up into his calm blue eyes, which surveyed her with nothing more than the detached concern of a colleague. After watching their mission control center explode in the sky and their spare ship lose function, after waiting for two weeks for a signal from Jack that never came, after finally being forced to climb down with a rope when her supplies ran low and Jack's remembered pleas to follow him outside became her only clue, she was, quite frankly, close to panicking. Regulations didn't even begin to cover this. How could he be so calm? \"Please,\" he said quietly, \"Try to relax. Take some water. I'll try to explain.\" He picked up a glass from a nearby table; remembering her survival training (even though she'd hoped to never need it) she forced herself to sip it slowly and carefully. Despite herself, the cool moisture calmed her down; she could feel her parched body soaking it up like a flower after rain. In a world that was falling apart on her, it was somehow reassuring to feel that her body's needs were the same. \"Now explain,\" she ordered, once she was done. \"And make it a good one.\" \"Okay,\" he said, \"But before I do, there's someone I want you to meet.\" He gestured, and one of the shadows surrounding them moved into the light of the lamp on the table. Her heart nearly stopped in terror at the sight of the black cloak and armor – the Scavs, she thought, they're holding us prisoner! – but then she looked up, and the stranger's face was human. He was a tall man with shoulder-length blond hair and a short beard, and the look on his face was wary, but not unkind. \"I'm Simon Sykes,\" he introduced himself. \"Leader of what you call the Scavengers.\" \"They're all human, Vic,\" Jack added softly. \"They've been human all along.\" / The story they told her, taking turns to answer her questions, was almost too wild to be believed – armies of clones, a forgotten wife, a malign artificial intelligence sent to exploit the planet, a heroic sacrifice. Her head spun. She went through two more glasses of water, yet still felt thirstier than ever. It felt like being told that the Earth was flat and the sun rose in the west. It was too much. She had obeyed Mission Control's every command, supported Jack to the best of her ability. She had done everything right, so how could everything have gone so wrong? \"How do I know you're not lying to me?\" she spat. \"How do I know you're not some alien trick to mess with my mind?\" \"Maybe the fact that we saved your life ?\" Sykes retorted, raising his eyes to the ceiling. \"Are all you clones this stubborn?\" She glared back. \"You know me, Vicca,\" said Jack, tracing a line between them in the air. \"Am I the type of guy who'd go out on a suicide mission for no reason? Well, neither was the other Jack. He blew up the Tet to save us all.\" That did sound like her Jack, she had to admit. Reckless. Heroic. Fond of a grand gesture. Still, tears began to sting her eyes as she remembered Sally's promise to buy them a round of drinks. Her leader, her friend, her only companion during Jack's missions, had been nothing but a computer-generated copy of a woman long dead. \"I thought I knew you,\" she said to Jack, \"But if nothing else is what I thought it was, why should you be? For heaven's sake, you're married . How can you be married when you're just a clone of that woman's husband? When you don't know where to find her, or if she's even alive?\" Jack sighed and looked away. Something about him, sitting next to her cot on the dirty floor with his arms around his knees, struck a familiar chord in her; he often looked like this when he was disappointed by her reaction to something he said. She remembered. \"It's the woman in your dreams,\" she forced herself to ask. \"Isn't it?\" He had told her about those dreams once, asking her if she had retained any similar memories from before the wipe. The look on Vicca's face must have upset him then, because he had looked away in just this manner and dismissed the subject. Vicca had been jealous, fiercely and instinctively so, as soon as he described the woman's appearance: Long black hair. Hazel eyes. Russian. Vicca knew this, because she dreamed about Julia Rusakova as well. Vicca had always admired her intelligent, soft-spoken colleague. She would have done anything to take her place. \"I'm sorry, Vicca,\" said Jack, squeezing her hand, his blue eyes brimming over with regret. \"But don't you see it's better this way?\" \"I don't.\" She pulled her hand out of his grasp and turned her back on him, facing the wall. \"Forgive me if I don't understand how cheating on me with a ghost makes anything better!\" \"I wasn't – she's not a - \" \"Harper.\" Sykes interrupted him with a quiet, firm tone. \"I think the lady's had enough shocks for the day. Time to go.\" She heard Jack scrambling to his feet. He touched her shoulder and she slapped his hand away, too worn out to care how immature that was. \"Listen to your boss, Jack,\" she snapped, \"Leave me alone.\" His uniform boots shuffled off, growing fainter along what sounded like a long tunnel or hallway. She was expecting Sykes to leave as well, but to her surprise, he stayed put, settling himself with a tired grunt in the same place Jack had been sitting. She almost ordered him to go away, but didn't; oddly enough, unused as she was to strangers, his presence was reassuring. His bluntness gave her the impression of honesty; unlike Jack, she sensed that he wasn't the type to lie or keep secrets from a member of his team. \"What an idiot,\" he muttered. \"Must be genetic.\" She turned over to face him. \"Excuse me?\" \"When the other one – Harper 49 – turned up here, I was all for shooting him,\" Sykes admitted, shaking his head. \"But Beech insisted we could trust him – because of the girl, you see. Beech was right, of course. We do trust him. Doesn't mean he's not an idiot.\" Vicca surprised herself with a rusty little laugh. \"Who's Beech?\" she inquired. \"Our leader … our former leader, I mean. Malcolm Beech. The one who went with 49 to nuke the Tet.\" Sykes' handsome features darkened, and she recognized the look of a proud man trying to hide his grief. So he'd lost someone too. Maybe this Beech had been to him what Sally – or at least the image of Sally – had been to her? \"Something about some goddamn poem he'd read,\" Sykes continued. \" How can a man die better/than facing fearful odds/for the ashes of his fathers/and the temples of his gods? \" Vicca shuddered. \"Really? Well, I for one would rather die of old age.\" Sykes' mustache curled up in a faint smile, making him look surprisingly younger. \"Who knows? Now the invaders are gone, that might be a viable option.\" The thought of death led to another question, one she immediately wished she hadn't thought of. All the same, it needed to be asked. \"The other Jack … 49, you called him … did he have a - a communications officer as well? Is she … what happened to her?\" \"You, uh … are you sure you want to know?\" His hesitation – which she already knew was unusual – only made her more determined. \"Just tell me.\" \"She's dead.\" Vicca squeezed her eyes shut, seeing blood on the insides of her eyelids. Picturing her own body crumpled on the ground. When she opened them, Sykes was holding out a tiny silver triangle – identical to the badge she wore on her own gray dress. \"We found her in Tower 49,\" he explained, passing it to her with a respectful nod. \"Shot by a drone. We don't know what happened there, but whatever it was, at least it was quick. Harper 52 insisted that we bury her in our own graveyard … is that all right?\" The humanity of that gesture, and the awkward way he asked for permission, made it only slightly less horrifying. Still, she nodded. \"How many of us are there?\" she whispered. \"If we're number 52 … \" It was a nightmarish idea: fifty-two Viccas praying for fifty-two Jacks to come home safely. Fifty-two ghosts of Julia forever between them. Fifty-two teams who would feel lost without Sally to guide them. Unhappiness on an industrial scale. \"You were the only ones we could reach,\" said Sykes. She watched him fingering the edge of his black Scavenger cloak, and decided that, whatever had happened to the other couples, she did not want to know. She squeezed Vicca 49's badge until her fingers ached. Had she died alone, or had Jack been there? Had Julia? Had it been jealousy that drove Vicca 49 to activate the drone? She wondered what it meant that she, Vicca 52, had arrived so easily at that conclusion. Since when had her love for Jack, the best and brightest part of her lonely life, warped her thoughts into something so ugly? Perhaps they had simply been alone too long. \"All I wanted was to finish our shift and get to Titan,\" she said, hating the whining edge to her own voice. \"We were supposed to join a colony, make friends, be part of something greater … together … \" Tears choked her all over again as she remembered the old daydreams that were never coming true: a beautiful, silver-and-white apartment like the one at the Tower, with a view of the stars. Other women to laugh and gossip with, other men to watch Jack's baseball games with him. Co-workers who could help her out with malfunctioning equipment, and for whom she could do the same. A simple wedding in dress uniform, officiated by Sally, with vows they would write themselves. Children with blue eyes and auburn hair. How foolish she had been. \"Hey, now … Ms. Young? Victoria?\" Something warm touched her hands, making her look up. Sykes had taken off his black leather glove to offer comfort. \"I can imagine that you must have been though hell,\" he said quietly, \"But, at the risk of sounding cheesy, it's not the end of the world.\" \"Isn't it?\" \"We do have a community here,\" he said, gesturing with his other hand. \"It may not be as clean and comfortable as one of your Towers, but we've got everything we need to survive. Also, I run a tight ship - \" He grinned. \"Like my predecessor before me. We've got rules, and we live by them. Anyone who doesn't - \" He gestured over his shoulder with one thumb and whistled, indicating exile. Some people might have been nervous, but Vicca only felt relief. she could breathe again. She was a rule-abiding person, and always had been. Now that all the rules she lived by were rendered meaningless, Simon Sykes' warning was like a life vest thrown to someone who was drowning. For the first time since the explosion of the Tet, she could breathe again. \"I understand completely,\" she said. \"What are the rules?\" Sykes' gray eyes, lined with wrinkles from the sun, were surprisingly kind as they met hers. \"You'll have plenty of time to learn. For now, all you need to know is the first rule: we provide for our own. Including you.\" He squeezed her hand, then gently took away the badge. You don't need that, his gesture seemed to say. You've got more than a voice from a computer to watch your back now.. For the first time in what felt like decades, Victoria Young felt the beginnings of hope.

All of humanity was inside that giant monolith and he would rejoin them in just a few short years after completing his tour of active duty. Then he and Julia would sleep for a long time and awaken when everyone reached Centari X. Jack gazed down at her peaceful, sleeping face. It used to be unusual to put husband and wife in the same unit, but became standard practice years ago. Sally told Julia that once. Jack supposed it was because no one could just forget their partner. He still had a few lingering memories from before the mandatory memory wipe. They both did. Julia stirred in her sleep. Her arm came to rest next to his thigh. Jack tangled his fingers with hers as the dawn baptized them both with red and orange. \"Morning.\" The word came first, then the smile. Jack squeezed her hand. \"Morning.\" The sun glinted off the Tet and reflected on her face. Jack lay back down and brushed his fingers through it. Their eyes drank deep of each other and they kissed.

All I knew was that we weren't an effective team anymore, I needed to call Sally. More tears escaped my eyes and blurred my eyesight. More minutes passed and I saw that manipulative girl and Jack. I advanced towards the door slowly. I had already called Sally. He banged on the glass door. \"Victoria! let me explain.

Victoria, Julia is my wife.\" \"Are you still an effective team?\" \"No.\" I answered with venom. \"Victoria, no!\" Jack exclaimed. I let him in this time. \"Victoria, there are things you don't know and what I need to explain. Do you have any idea what you've done?!\" Jack explained. I didn't need to hear it.

My strange brain, being the way it is, managed to think of a way to link all the characters to Louella, and create a story. Hopefully that clears up any confusion you may have... Obviously I don't own Bugsy, but I hope you enjoy and please Read and Review! In the speakeasy the music was loud and the lights shone brightly. The show girls were singing the famous 'Grand Slam' song, and Louella was feeling ashamed at being able to sing the words quietly alongside them. She knew she shouldn't have felt so guilty being there but she knew inside that she was betraying Dandy Dan big time. It wasn't just the fact that she was with another guy at the time; it was because she was there- in Fat Sam's Speakeasy. When the song finished and the showgirls left the stage Louella sat and contemplated her situation. Dandy Dan had been ignoring her lately; his schemes with the gang to rid Fat Sam of his establishment seemed to be way more important to him. She sighed. Maybe it was time to go home. Just as she got up to leave a commotion started in the speakeasy. Everyone screamed as a bunch of Hoodlums burst into the room. Louella couldn't believe her eyes. It was Bronx Charlie and the rest of her husband's gang, right there in the doorway. Each of them held up guns and began to fire rapidly. Louella, unlike the rest of the occupants, knew what they contained and quickly hid under the table to avoid the splurge. She'd overheard Dandy Dan saying 'it was a revolutionary weapon that could take out their enemies from a distance of a few metres'. As the gang ran past her table splurging the unfortunates that had not hid, Doodle tripped and fell to the floor- dropping the gun in the process. He quickly pushed himself up. As he did so he spotted Louella. He paused stunned, trying to work out if it really was his boss's wife or not. Louella gasped as Doodle noticed her and desperately tried to think of a way to get out. She grabbed a nearby chair and chucked it at him. He scarpered before it hit him and she sighed in relief. But the nearby call of Bronx Charlie caused her to panic again. \"The gun Doodle, you dummy! Get the gun. You can't leave the gun!\" Louella scanned around and spotted the gun lying where Doodle had just fallen. She couldn't risk him seeing her again and realising it actually was her. Just as he ran over to pick it up she kicked it away from her, further into the middle of the speakeasy. He tripped again only managing to hold himself up as he ran forward after the gun. Once he had retrieved it he stumbled backwards, and decided to try and catch a glimpse of the girl he had seen before. Yet again Louella panicked as Doodle made an attempt to find her. If he saw her, she knew he would report it to Dandy Dan. Doodle stumbled backwards against the table Louella was hiding under and she screamed. However it made no difference to Doodle as the rest of the speakeasy was also shrieking and screaming as well. Bronx Charlie and Yonkers , tired of Doodle's useless efforts to retreat with the gun, ran in and grabbed him, dragging him back out of the speakeasy. Once the gang had left the noise died down. Fat Sam poked his head out of his office door and looked around before quickly smoothing out his suit and hurrying into the speakeasy. \"Ok everybody, it's ok! Nothing to worry about now! Back to your tables. Razamataz! Music!\" His little speech went unheard to Louella as she rushed out of the speakeasy. The gang were nowhere to be seen, but she knew she was going to have to get back before them.[Chapter 2] When the gang arrived back at Dandy Dan's manor Doodle considered whether to tell his boss about what he had seen at Fat Sam's Speakeasy. He was still unsure if the girl he saw was Louella or not. But then maybe if he was right and he did tell Dandy Dan he could be a more valued member of the gang. Like Bronx Charlie or Shoulders he thought. They always seemed to do right in Dandy Dan's eyes. Doodle rushed off to find his boss, leaving the other hoodlums stumped and left to deal with the guns by themselves. Dandy Dan was alone in his sitting room when Doodle burst in. He believed that it was a good sign that his boss's wife wasn't there. Dandy Dan looked up annoyed that his peaceful thinking time had been interrupted by Doodle. Doodle trembled at the angry stare from his boss, but remained where he stood. \"What is it?\" Dandy Dan snapped. Doodle stammered, pulling off his hat and passing it between his hands nervously. \"Er... Boss, earlier... at the speakeasy... I saw... I saw...\" Doodle paused, took a depth breath in and started again. \"I saw...\" \"Saw what Doodle? Don't waste my time if you haven't got anything to say.\" Doodle gulped. \"I saw Miss Louella, Boss... She was at the speakeasy... I-\" \"What?\" Dandy Dan snapped outraged. \"Don't you dare go accusing my wife of something like that!\" \"But I saw her Boss!\" Doodle cried timidly. \"She was there, right in front of me. I dropped the gun and she was-\" \"You dropped the gun?\" Dandy Dan repeated slowly but sharply, glaring at him. Doodle opened his mouth to speak, but instead waited fearfully for his boss's reaction. \"You dropped the gun?\" He repeated once again. \"I... I didn't mean to! But she was there, right in front of me Boss! I bet that's why she's not here right now!\" Doodle blabbed out quickly hoping it might save him from some kind of punishment. Dandy Dan raised an eyebrow, and without taking his eyes off Doodle shouted out of the door. \"Louella darling, can you come here a minute?\" Doodle's eyes widened as he realised he might have made a mistake. For a minute there was silence. As every second passed he became more and more hopeful. Dandy Dan dragged his eyes away from Doodle and glanced at the door before glaring back at him. \"Louella?\" He called out again, a little uncertain. A smile appeared on Doodle's face as he noticed that his boss was just starting to believe him. However his smile fell when they both heard the sound of heeled shoes walking across the wooden floor. \"Yes honey?\" She questioned, coming into the room and looking over the back of Dandy Dan's armchair. When she noticed Doodle in the room her mouth fell open, but she promptly shut it before he saw. Dandy Dan looked up at her and smiled. \"Hello my rose.\" He then turned back around and shook his head at Doodle slowly. Doodle trembled again. \"I think you'll find that you were wrong.\" Dandy Dan smirked, knowing he had got the better of the unfortunate Doodle. \"I'm... I'm sorry Boss! The fall... I must... I must have banged my head! I must have been seeing things! I didn't mean to accuse Miss Louella of anything!\" \"Get out Doodle.\" \"I'm sorry Boss! I'm so-\" \"I said GET OUT!\" Dandy Dan shouted, and Doodle fled the room terrified. Once he had left Dandy Dan turned to face his wife. \"Sorry about that my rose\" He apologised sweetly. \"Careful honey, if you keep goofs like that in your gang then you might not be as successful next time...\" \"Don't worry princess. There won't be a next time for him.\" Louella sighed in relief. She was safe for the time being.[Chapter 3] Sorry to all my followers and reviewers that have had to wait the ridiculous amount of time since my last chapter (I can't believe I let it get this long!) But hey, I'm back on it now, and so this fanfic is now getting the attention it deserves! And of course I don't own Bugsy Malone. I h ope you enjoy and do take time to review afterwards! A few hours later that day Dandy Dan was contemplating what Doodle had said to him. Doodle wasn't the smartest of his gang, but he was probably the most trustworthy. The others were sly criminals, just the type you wanted working on your side, but definitely not people to trust fully. Dandy Dan knew that for definite. Whether Doodle was telling the truth this time though, Dan couldn't be sure. None of the rest of his gang had come to him with this report of Louella being at Fat Sam's Speakeasy. It was either because they hadn't seen her there, or Doodle was lying. Maybe he was trying to save his own skin... Maybe he was using it as a way to get out of dropping the gun. Dandy Dan scowled. How could the dummy have dropped the gun? What if Fat Sam had managed to get it from him? As he started to think of more 'what ifs' his mood darkened. He clenched his fists tightly. Doodle must have been lying... Dan looked over at his wife who was sitting peacefully, listening to the cellist. Louella looked up and smiled at him sweetly. He couldn't help his face soften as he smiled back. She was his beautiful, innocent rose and she would never betray him. That was it, Dandy Dan thought. It was time to get rid of Doodle once and for all. He leaned over and stopped the cellist playing in the normal way: pressing on their nose. Louella looked up at him and pouted. \"Oh honey, don't turn that off! I was listening to that.\" \"I have to concentrate Princess.\" He answered smoothly. \"I have a little business to attend to.\" Louella looked down at the ground sadly. Dan always seemed to be busy- too busy to spend time with her. She couldn't help but think that this was why she spent time at the Speakeasy. Looking back up at her husband she shook her head slightly to rid the thought from her mind. She couldn't go back there – today had been a lucky escape and she knew it. Dandy Dan smiled at her and guiltily Louella dropped her eyes back to the floor. Luckily he didn't notice her reaction as the butler gently tapped on the open door to announce his presence. Dan nodded at him; a signal to show that he was allowed to speak. \"I've shown Mr Bronx Charlie and Company into the conservatory, Sir\" The butler then fell silent again, waiting to escort his master to the other room. Dan rose from his armchair, brushing down his suit and slicking back his hair with his hand. Not that he needed to; his appearance was always immaculate, but then he never did any of the dirty work. Louella looked up at him sadly. He'd just spent half the day out, signing some deal for a shipload of new guns and now he was up and leaving her again for his work. She was tired of being ignored. \"Ain't you gonna play no more honey?\" She spoke up adamantly. He glanced down, frowning slightly at the harshness of his wife's tone. Quickly Louella softened her features, pouting slightly and opening her eyes a little wider. For a moment she saw him hesitate as his frown disappeared. He then shook his head slowly. \"Later my rose, later.\" Kneeling before her, he took her hand and pressed his lips to it lightly. Louella blinked, her mouth parting slightly and losing the pout as she realised that she was to be left alone once again. Dan then left the room without a further word. As she felt the sobs rise in her throat she shooed away the musician and tried desperately not to cry. Any normal relationship, she thought, wouldn't be like this. Normal couples would surely spend time together, not ignore one another. Damn gangsters . She wondered why she stayed. It wasn't the money, although she couldn't deny that she enjoyed her lavish lifestyle. Sure, her family were affluent and had wanted their only daughter to be married to a rich man and nothing less. She'd had a fair choice of candidates to select from as well: bankers, high society gentlemen and heck, even a member of the lesser nobility, but instead she had relied on her heart and chosen the young, dapper gangster who had unconventionally wooed her at her parents private social event, not in the presence of an overbearing governess, like all the others had to. And the event was one that he most certainly hadn't been invited to. But he had been so charming and so funny that she couldn't resist. Luckily for her parents, he was rich, and therefore after a lot of persuasion they agreed to let the two marry. Louella sighed. She couldn't deny that she loved him. But the loneliness was getting too much to bear. She wiped her wet lashes, hoping her make-up hadn't run. Then an idea formed in her head. What if she just went and peered into the conservatory, listened in to what her husband was saying ? It sounded like a good enough idea. She stood from the chair, walked over to the doorway and glanced out. Down the wide hallway she could just see Dandy Dan talking to the line of Hoods through the glass doors. Slowly and being as quiet as she possibly could, Louella crept down the hallway until she was just outside the conservatory. She could hear her husband's voice clearly and, so not to be seen, she scooted behind a large potted fern that stood near to the entrance. She then peeked between the leaves to watch the group of men. As she did, the volume of Dandy Dan's voice increased dramatically. \"You goofed Doodle! You dropped the gun. And I don't allow mistakes in this outfit, 'cause mistakes put us all in the caboose and Sing Sing ain't my style.\" By this point Louella could see that the Hoods and her husband had encircled the unfortunate Doodle, and he began babbling some kind of apology. Louella watched concerned; Doodle was quieter than her husband, and she could only guess at what he was saying. Worry set in as she hoped it wasn't something about her. However Dan's voice came as a relief to her. \"Button your lip Doodle. You're all washed up.\" Then each member of his gang chucked a plateful of splurge at him, and Louella watched horrified as Doodle's body stiffened as the stuff coated him. She then heard her husband order the gang to remove his body from the house instantly and then stormed off into the garden. By this point Louella had turned her back, not wanting to catch another glimpse of Doodle's body. Her breath had become panicky and uneven; Doodle had done nothing wrong and ended up dead . She dreaded to think what would happen to her if Dandy Dan ever found out the truth.

N'hésitez pas à nous rejoindre : le lien est dans mes fav' !) Le but des nuits d'écriture ? Un mot, une heure pour rédiger un OS et le poster. Thème : Vampire L'amour est un vampire. Il te prend un jour et ne te relâche plus. C'était une chose que Jin avait retenu de son enfance. Un schéma qu'il s'était juré de ne pas appliquer. L'amour est un vampire. Il te prend, et emporte avec lui ta vie, ton quotidien, ton bon sens. Il te prend tout et t'emprisonne dans une toile de mots sucrés, de demi-mensonges pour rendre cet univers supportable, et fini par ravir ta vie. Jin avait juré qu'il serait aussi joueur que le vent... Oui, il se contenterait d'étreintes fugaces, de mots rapides de séduction. Facilité. Liberté, surtout. Oui, l'amour est un vampire. Il te prend, t'embrasse et s'empare de tout ce que tu as. Jin sourit dans le vent. Oui, l'amour vient de lui prendre son honneur de soldat. Vient de lui prendre le futur qu'on lui promettait – pouvoir, argent, reconnaissance. De quoi lui rendre la vie plus facile. De quoi assurer sa subsistance s'il se débrouillait assez bien entre les guerres de clans. L'amour lui a pris son bon sens également. Trop pris par les yeux aveugles de Mei, il n'a rien vu venir. Il n'a rien su voir, surtout. Ses mensonges. Ses silences. Elle l'a entraîné avec lui – et pire il l'a suivi de son plein gré. Il a tué ses camarades. Il s'est vendu à l'ennemi. Le pire, c'est qu'il savait déjà que l'ennemi lui en voulait. Mais ce n'était pas grave. Bien sûr, maintenant que Mei à ouvert ses yeux aveugles et que le filet lui est tombé dessus, il ne peut qu'en rire. Oui, l'amour est un vampire et t'attache par ses murmures flatteurs, par ses illusions de bonheur, t'attache et te laisse haletant tenter de te libérer. Il n'a même pas envie de se libérer. Il n'a plus le choix, de toute façon, alors qu'elle le tire derrière lui, qu'il trébuche sur la route à cause de ses yeux bandés. Il n'a plus le choix depuis longtemps – on ne lutte pas contre ce grand vampire. Il fera comme les autres. Il ouvrira les bras puisque sa dernière heure arrive et lui fera un grand sourire – puisque tu m'as tout pris, grand vampire, prend aussi ma vie. Oui, il aura un grand sourire et même l'indulgence de limiter les remords de Mei – pourquoi pas après tout, si ce grand vampire l'avait prise elle, les rôles auraient été inversés. Peut-être, peut-être que ce vampire l'a mordue elle aussi. Sa voix tremble un peu. Ma foi, si elle le tue, ce sera tant mieux. Le vampire la laissera partir, elle. La laissera vivre comme elle veut, et peut-être est-ce une bonne chose parce que leurs jours sont comptés. Jin relève ses épaules, attends le coup qui ne vient pas. Pourquoi le retenir ?

Churned in eddies by a malevolent gale, it plummeted from swirled, marengo clouds until it came to a peaceful rest as thick as a woollen blanket over the tall scrub grass of the plain: a wide, rolling expanse amidst the silver birch forest at the foot of the mountains. In spring it dazzled with ten thousand daisies, in summer was lush and green and, by autumn, it glowed with the colours of fire. But now, robed white, the snow hid its beauty from view. Across this plain traveled the man, bent double against the howling wind, with tattered cloaks of coarse wool wrapped tight for any warmth they could offer. He forced onwards up, over, and down the gentle curves of the land, trudging through the snow in boots soaked through. He led a pack horse behind him on reins of battered leather, the horse in turn pulled a single axel cart barely filled with firewood. The man's name was Old Xiàngmù and he was reaching his seventy-ninth year. He was plagued by arthritis and an incessant ache in his bowels which would flare to burning pain after every meal; but no ailment or pain could stop him from his journey, for without firewood there was no fire, and without fire he would freeze – such was the ferocity of the winter. He was a man of lowly birth and name - a turner of soil and planter of seeds - in a desolate corner of the land, a land held in the tyrannical grip of a dying imperial power; a wounded tiger fighting to the last breath. Merciless laws, extortionate taxes, and corrupt officials had reduced Old Xiàngmù's humble but pleasant life into an existence of brutal hardship. Old Xiàngmù led his horse and cart over the bleak and whitened plain, heading towards the North Path etched into the forest ahead. His gaze did not move from the forest before him but, as he neared the welcoming confines of the trees his attention was stolen for, over the way, the white blanket of snow was tainted with red spatters of blood. Small slivered lines at first they grew as Old Xiàngmù followed them until he came to a crimson pool in which lay the body of a woman. Dark, matted hair draped past a face of such beauty that, for a moment, Old Xiàngmù thought he had stumbled across the body of a goddess. She wears flowing robes in every shade of green possible, entwined with intricate designs of golden embroidery. But at her left breast the robes were damaged and soiled by a mortal wound, a black hole surrounded by flecks of congealed blood like the petals of a deadly flower. Old Xiàngmù's hands strayed to the wound where he found it wet; she died not long ago. He knelt beside her, whispered a solemn prayer, and wondered what circumstances lead her here, to this desolate plain: to her death. As he stood, Old Xiàngmù spotted another trail of blood moving east from the woman's body. Bracing himself against the wind, he followed the trail until he came across the body of an imperial officer face down in the snow, his black cap a few feet away and his dark uniform tattered and bloodied. Old Xiàngmù, guessing it was this officer who dealt the deadly wound to the woman's heart, spat on the officer with vehement anger and struck the dead man's side with his foot – too many a time had Old Xiàngmù and his kin been hounded by imperial officer dogs like he. Old Xiàngmù returned to his horse and sets off towards the forest and the North Path, his heart heavy with grief and anger. The North Path was seldom used, especially during a winter storm, so Old Xiàngmù jumped in surprise as, turning a corner, he saw a chestnut stallion before him. For a moment he feared it was the steed of an imperial officer, ready to steal Old Xiàngmù's firewood under the guise of one tax or another but, as he approached, he saw the horse's bridle and saddle did not bear imperial insignia. The horse was standing over a man, slumped against a tree and the snow about him splashed red. He wore robes similar to those of the dead woman from the plain but, instead of green, his were blue and gold. They were torn and bore the dark blood encircled holes of wounds. The man was young with a handsome face, pale with death, and did not move as Old Xiàngmù approached. Old Xiàngmù wondered how many other bodies he would find on his way home and knelt beside the young man, to offer another final prayer. It is then Old Xiàngmù saw the slow rising and falling of the man's chest. He was alive. He checked the man over and realised he was clinging to life by the finest of silver threads. Old Xiàngmù removed his outer cloak and, tearing it into pieces, fashioned bandages around the young man's more serious of wounds. As he bound the young man's right arm, a leather pouch fells from his fingers. Within the pouch were five small Kukri blades, their handles bound in leather and topped with slim and auriferous pommels. Old Xiàngmù drew a breath. Although the design of the knives were unusual, the image of them was a phantom symbol of rebellion to people like Old Xiàngmù; a sign of hope and freedom. The owners of these knives were members of the so-called Flying Dagger House, a secretive clan of warriors seeking to overthrow the corrupt government. The Flying Dagger House fought to keep the imperial armies away and the people of the land safe. There had been times when Old Xiàngmù and his village found sacks of rice at the doors of their homes, left by mysterious donors; on another occasion, the heads of an imperial general and his officers, who had attacked Old Xiàngmù's village and stolen all the rice only a few days before, hung from the trees with fresh blood dripping from their severed bases. Each time, only a single note had been left: regards from The House of Flying Daggers . Although no one had ever knowingly met a member of the Flying Dagger House, or gazed upon their knives, the stories and rumours travelled across the land like benevolent ghosts of fortune. And now Old Xiàngmù stood before one of their members, badly wounded but still alive: it was an auspicious sign, he was sure of it. Forgetting his exhaustion, and the pains about his joints, Old Xiàngmù lifted the wounded man from the ground and lowered him into the cart. He tethered the man's horse and set off once more along the North Path, hoping to reach the village before nightfall. ","Summary":" Pure and innocent as a child's heart the snow fell.

Beauty and love were like daggers tonhis heart, as breathing, their bloodnmingling- she faded away. - - It had been such anbeautiful dance-one that had been the beginning of what he had wantednto believe was love. Even now he refused to believe that such anthing had never been born between the two of them. He refused tonacknowledge that another had held fast to her heart-despite thenobvious love that he carried for the lovely woman with whom he hadnbeen so close. Had been… Even after what hadnjust transpired, Lao could not come to terms with the fact that thenlove of his life-his life of devotion to the House-was now dead. nDead at the hands of he, he who had claimed to love her too much tonlet her live a life in the arms of another! Still he could see thenlook of betrayal that was thrown across her face as his blade wasnthrown across the clearing. To pierce the heart henhad held so dear. \"Oh Mai-why could younnot find in within you to love me?\" Lao whispered brokenly betweennclenched teeth as he tried desperately to focus on the pain, thenphysical pain that shrouded his entire body. He had no desire tondwell upon the events of earlier-and already his mind was stubbornlynshying away from the memory of Mai's smile as he threw a drop ofnhis blood onto the trees, even as she threw the dagger towards thencrimson marker. He had meant to usenthat drop of blood to initiate the dance that had bonded them in thenbeginning. A dance of Edo-she hadnalways been so lovely when she had danced for him. Lao would thrownmarkers around for her, forcing her to listen to the sound of thensmall objects as they bounced off of the intended target. Henremembered the way her body moved like liquid, her sinewy musclesnsliding over one another as they strained to hit every spot in whichnthe object had hit-all of this dance had to be done with speed,nprecision, and memory. It was a deadly dancenwhen used in battle, and Mai had always taken to it with exceptionalnpassion… Passion he had wished to be turned towards a life with himnas her husband. Yet thoughts of Mainwere far too painful-and every time he imagined her face before him,na whimper would escape from his frigid blue lips that only darkenednwith the falling of the snow. \"Why couldn't younjust love me?

In three days time henhad come to love the person who he had been sent to betray. And nownas he thought about it-he wondered how it was that he had not lovednher even sooner… For despite the factnthat she represented the enemy to those whom he worked for, Mai hadnbeen a gust of wind that carried the scent of the sea-a sea whosenwaves rose and fell across the expanse of eternity. And now the rebel whonhad captured his heart-and had given hers to him in return-lay coldnand still within his arms, and Jeiin couldn't even begin tonunderstand why. The only thing he couldneven recognize was that she was gone-far out of his reach. And evennher song spewing from his mouth could not wake her again, and he didnnot think that any force on this earthly world could. Silently he blamed thenwar for her death, as he blamed the rebels, as he blamed Lao thenBetrayer, as he blamed them all! No rational sense could make himnrealize that it was also these things that had brought them together,nlet them spend time together-no matter how brief. And it had been brief,nreminding him of some flickering flame, one that would never last innweather like this-just as their love had not been able to lastnthrough the trials that had been thrown towards them-most note-ablynthe barrier that separated his soul and heart from hers. Death. Yet he did not think itnwould be too long before that shield was non-existent. For he couldnfeel his heart's blood fleeing from between the lacerations andngouges made from Lao's blade. But these wounds were merelynsuperficial to him, even the pain that China was experiencing seemednmeaningless and trivial to the agony he felt within his chest. A powerful blast ofnwind fell upon them, and he reflexively cradled Mai even closer tonthe warmth of his chest, shielding her broken body from thenfrigidness of the falling snow and the raging wind. \"Wind.\" Jeiinnmurmured quietly, remembering how important that element had been tonthem and their strange relationship.

The two men sat apart from each other, legs crossed, fists clenched, swords lying inches from their hands. Of course, one would die. It was inevitable, he knew that. He had known that the moment he saw the back of him. The day beyond the porch was bleak and cold, the heavy clouds threatening the first of the season snows. In the gardens the pond paved over with ice, and the herons had immigrated south. They were all but alone. The tense silence loosened their minds, just as wine had loosened their tongues, back in their youth. Adrenaline began to make itself known, nestling into the hollow of Jin's throat, and his heart quickened its disciplined pace. Beyond the window frame, white, pristine flakes began to descend from the heavens, heavy and unperturbed in their journeys to the ground. They needn't have worried, upon leaving the safe womb of their cloud, there was no wind to trouble them these days. He was not meant to have lived beyond that snow storm. But he had lived to see many. The first few years after her death, she had visited him in his dreams. As soon as the first snow fell, he closed his eyes and let her come. She was a spirit, a beautiful phantom who seduced and enchanted him. It was only when he awoke, did he feel the harsh sting of winter. Leo's eyes were narrowed, his jaw set, and his hair streaked into grey. There was no need for words, yet he spoke then, and his voice was throaty, grief induced. 'I am the last of the Flying Daggers.' Jin simply nodded, his face as calm as his body, while his insides ached with the strain of it. 'You know why I am here.' He nodded, again. 'And I know what you are thinking.' He sniffed slightly, the skin of his lower jaw tugging downwards, as he shot his nose briefly into the air. 'I think it too.' Looking down, 'I should have taken my own life' Jin was silent, he found the silence more satisfying, more maddening, more judgemental than anything else he could have said. 'Mei haunts me while I sleep, she hides in the recesses of my dreams, of the shadows of my nightmares. She only shows her face as the snow falls in the night. And her face is as white as the blizzard she finds me in. She only smiles though, but all the while, that smile, it terrifies me.' He finished, and looked up into the eyes of his listener. Why he was telling him this? Only he knew, only Jin knew the pain he was feeling, only Jin knew the woman he had loved and lost. The woman he had loved and killed. 'I reach out to her, but she flies around me like a butterfly.' Jin was silent for a few minutes longer, letting the silence seep in through Leo's ears and curl itself around his brain. Then he spoke, and his voice was so much changed, that at first he wondered whether it was the same man with whom he spoke. 'Mei visits me as well' As the years had passed, he found it far more bearable to speak her name. But it still pulled at the invisible seams of an old wound, to repeat it now. He went on; 'She visits me when the snow falls, and she takes me in her ghostly arms, and I can feel the heat from her heart against my living skin. Sometimes we re-act the one moment of satisfaction we shared when we were both alive, but mostly we talk, we talk about how we love each other.' Jin stopped there, failing to mention the fact that she spoke a few times of her love for Leo. Remembering her last visit, Jin's skin warmed slightly despite the frost. He remembered the passion, the desire, and the feel of her light weight limbs brushing softly against his own, her hair falling against his shoulder, and how she had smiled and sighed, when they released. Leo flinched, and recovered. He always recovered, no matter what the wound, physical or other. Now as an aging man, he found it very difficult to look the Wind straight in the eye, knowing all along, that he was the man she had chosen. 'You should not take your life Leo. I will not let you have the satisfaction of leaving this world to meet her again' Jin felt her presence against his neck, the ghostly touch of silk brush along his bare skin. Outside, the first of the snow flakes settled on anything they could find, and would remain there for months. He saw her reflection in the natural diamonds, the beautiful effervescent light which had captured and held her all this time. She was as alone as he. He observed Leo on a new level, his forehead was creased into y shaped frown. The scowl seemed permanent, as though the wind had blown it into shape. He chuckled darkly, knowing he had always been a source of discomfort in the other man's life. He seemed changed, more sincere maybe, but he could easily detect the short tempered young man hiding away in the corners of his dark eyes. He held onto his youth too much, the years had not seen him grow wise. Jin had often wondered why he had remained in this life for so long. But he felt the pull of something, whenever he had reached for Mei's last dagger, he had felt the pull of life and will, even if it was not his own. Now he understood. He had lived for this last moment, this one last moment of revenge, of understanding. 'You will never die, and we will never meet. I will never forgive you, and you will never forgive yourself' Wind spoke slowly and clearly, as though he were trying to explain something very simple and mandatory to a young child. He saw again, the flicker of anger streak through Leo's unchanged eyes. He carried on, 'Mei pities you. You will never see her in the afterlife. You will never be able to explain yourself to her, like you so often dream of doing. Even though, she knows why you did it. She understands, and it is because her hidden heart is strong enough to hold her love for you in its cage. But it was never enough for you, was it? Her love, you needed something more. Something to hold that love, to never let it slip. Because it could never grow.' He knew it, he had hit a nerve. The older man's face was puckered, and turning a sallow pasty colour beneath the visible sheen of nervous sweat. 'So kill me Leo. And what's more I will forgive you, I will thank you even. And me and Mei will visit you in your winter dreams.' Leo's hand shot into the breast of his robe, irrational as ever. And the dagger hissed even faster, into Jin's chest. The pain was more than he had anticipated, suffocating, acute, burning, but not enough to drown out all these years of remorse. Leo would never die while it snowed. Jin had waited his life to declare and to curse this upon him. He would never die in the winter, and he would never be reunited with Mei. With effort, Jin scraped his way across the porch, and into the snow of his home garden. Here, the wild flowers grew, despite the maintained appearance of his house, and the cold mocking remarks of his wife. Then, with one hand clutched tightly to the hilt protruding from his body, and the other curled beneath the biting frost around one such flower. Jin pulled the dagger grindingly from his chest. Hot, red blood pulsated from him, staining the snow. Now, at last, it was his time to die. The wind carried him up into the sky, where he dispersed with the falling flakes, and Mei joined him, curling and furling in and out of him, like butterflies in the playful, unseasonably warm winds. Author's Note: Really, I think that Jin and Leo probably would have died in the snowstorm, injured and cold as they were! But this is just what might have happened if they had both lived to tell the tale. I tried to do it realistically, but with a sense of the supernatural tucked away there to liven things up a little :) Hope you enjoyed it, and thanks for reading too! Also, sorry if there are any spelling or grammer mistakes, I tried to catch them all x p.s disclaimer: I don't own House of Flying daggers, but I did write this story!

You're part of the Flying Daggers and we're going to make you tell us where their headquarters are.\" Leo denied and denied of ever being part of the Flying Daggers. They chained him up and locked him the prison in which the kept Mei not so long ago. They used every technique they knew yet Leo wouldn't tell them anything, so they improvised… \"Leo? Why do you not tell them so you can go free and love me again?\" The voice sounded exactly like Mei's. Leo opened his eyes and looked up. Sure enough, there stood Mei. The imperial guards held her tight and didn't let her go loose. \"Mei, for you, I would do anything.\" \"Then tell these men what they want so you and I can go free to love each other.\" Leo caved into his love and told the imperial guards where the House of Flying Daggers was. They released him and both him and Mei left. Outside, the girl who claimed to be Mei revealed her true identity. She was not Mei, but and imitation. She said her name was Shi-Huang. She had a smug look on her face. Leo, realizing what he had done, ran. He ran to the bamboo forest and arrived at the House of Flying Daggers. He ran in and demanded to talk to their leader. \"Where is Nia? There is an urgent message!\" \"I am here. What is the urgnet message?\" \"The imperial army is on their way here.

It's not like she liked being the, quote on quote, 'trophy' in the battle between her two lovers. Her story is almost so messed up, who could unscramble it, well, we can. here is the real story behind Louella Rose. To get everything straight, we are going to have to start at the beginning, and i mean the very start. The first day of Louella's new life in New York, that's where the story starts. Louella rose was a small town girl who, when she turned 19, took all of her money and moved to New York. It was her chance for a new beginning, her opportunity for a brand new start. All Louella wanted to do was find a new life in New York, but by chance the first joint she walked into was an old speakeasy in astoundingly good shape. Fat Sam's it was called. You see, Louella didn't even mean to end up in that speakeasy that day, she just wanted to buy a book from this small little bookstore she found on the corner of one number and another. She didn't mean to pull out the book that opened the door to the speakeasy, and she sure didn't mean to be so curious that she decided to investigate. At first, the loud music and flashing lights of the underground establishment were too much for Louella, but in reality she began to enjoy it within less than a minute. This is what she had seen in New York, wonderful secrets and surprises around every corner. Louella walked over to a table in front of a small stage where dancers kicked there legs in tassel covered costumes. She set down her purse on the table and watched the dancers. 'What pitiful souls,' was the first thought that entered her mind. She had never understood entertainers, or really enjoyed the profession. Once in a while she would admit it could be fun to act out a little white lie, but that didn't make her a superstar. She only wanted to settle down, and that was the truth. The dream was to be a housewife to a wealthy man, and she knew she could achieve it. She pulled a small hand mirror and light pink lipstick out of her purse, re applying it on her lips. she was proud at the way it contrasted with her brown dress and brown hair, and matched her pink shoes and purse. When Louella put down the mirror she saw that someone was sitting across the table from her.[Chapter 2] \"Hello sweetheart,\" the tall, slender man sitting in front of her said. He was wearing an obnoxiously parallel pinstripe suit and a matching hat. A red carnation was pinned to the breast of his suit. Louella almost jumped out of her seat, she hadn't even noticed him sit down. \"Um, hello,\" she said, smoothing down her dress and putting her makeup items back into her purse. \"I didn't see you sit down.\" The words that came from her mouth did not seem smooth like usual, but instead rocky and stammered. \"Fat Sam, owner and operator of this fine establishment, if I don't say so myself.\" He held out a hand which wore a stainless white glove. He spoke with a very strong New York accent, Jersey sounding but with a little more of a gangster twist in the words. Louella meekly lifted her hand and shook his with a small nod and grin. \"Oh come on doll, don't be so shy!\" Fat Sam said, referring to the soft smile and weak handshake. \"This is Fat Sam's! Everyone knows everybody, even if you haven't met in your entire life! Anyone who steps foot in here is family, I take it upon myself to make sure of that.\" Louella didn't respond, no words flashed into her usually full brain. Fat Sam noticed the absence of speech and decided to carry the conversation on himself. \"So whats a beautiful woman like you sitting all alone up here looking like a rich little suburban girl?\" Louella looked down at herself. She did not look poor, that's for sure. Maybe the pastel tones of her dress and accessories showed she wasn't used to a city as flamboyant as the big apple, and the obviousness that her dress was made from real silk proved she was wealthy, but no man from where she grew up would ever be so forward in such an impolite way. \"I take pride in the fact that I'm from a small town, and my daddy's money is none of your business sir.\" She said, folding her hands on her lap and sitting up straight in an arrogant way.\" Fat Sam took up a sly grin upon his slim lips. \"Hm, your daddy's money? You really are a big town rich girl living in a small, small world Miss- well, it seems that I haven't caught your name yet.\" \"Louella, my names Louella.\" Fat Sam leaned back in his chair, kicking his feet up on the table and crossing his arms behind his head. His sly grin extended to his cheeks and up to his eyes until his smile took up all the space on his face. \"Well Louella, welcome to New York, We are going to have a lot of fun.\"[Chapter 3] \"What do you mean by that?\" Louella asked, leaning forward but still keeping her perfect posture. \"Well I mean I'm going to show you how much fun it is to be young and rich in New York.\" Fat Sam reached over to the table and picked a toothpick out of a dispenser, then placing it softly in between his lips. He bit it with his teeth and began rolling it to the sides of his mouth. \"Do you mean take advantage of my privileges? How could you suggest such an uncivilized thing?\" Louella asked, almost genuinely outraged but not quite. \"I'm not saying that you should go around blowin' all your money just cause you've got a big purse, Miss Louella, I'm just saying that if you've got beauty like yours, why sit around hunched in a corner looking like part of a birds nest waiting for time to pass? Live your life, and live it big.\" Louella once again doubted her fashion choices. \"So what are you saying, Mr. Fat Sam?\" Louella asked, beginning to become intrigued. \"Firs, stop calling me that awful title. My Name's Sam Stacetto, and just a simple Sam will do. And what I'm saying, lets get you lookin' like you've never left New York in your life.\" Sam stood up and motioned for Louella to do the same. Louella grabbed her purse and ran up next to Sam. Sam looked over to her with a smile and extended his hand. Louella grabbed it and they shuffled out of the speakeasy and out into the booming streets of New York.[Chapter 4] \"Bangles, what could be taking her so long?' Sam asked the lead dancer impatiently, tapping both his watch and his toe. It had been five hours since he had dropped her off at the Macy's on 14th and 6th, three hours since he had sent his best cab to pick her up, and, hell, what woman takes three hours to get ready? \"I dunno sir, I think the gal's might be helpin' her get all made up, I can check with them if you like.\" Bangles had a pure Jersey accent, and she smacked gum between, slightly crooked but, perfectly white teeth. \"If you could do that Bangles-\" Sam got cut short by the sound of a door opening from the top balcony of the room. Louella stepped out, dressed to the nines, and all jaws dropped. She wore a strapless striped black and white gown which started tight to her body and began flowing out at her waist until the trail dragged about three feet behind her. The striped on the dress were thick, about 4 inches in width, and just like the dress widened so did the stripes as they reached down the dress. A slight presence of jewels shimmered on the midriff of the dress, thinning and shimmering away as they passed shortly below the waist of the dress. A silver boa hung below Louella's shoulders and wrapped around her arms to let the ends hang down only about two feet. her shoes were silver heels which matched the boa and seemed to be made of the same jewels as on the dress. Her hair was curled and pinned tight to the right side of hear head, letting the curls cascade over her right shoulder. Red lipstick covered her thin but still beautiful lips, and silver eye shadow above her pure brown eyes and long black lashes made her shine like a million bucks. Sam raised his hand to his chest in complete awe of Louella's beauty. There was no sound in the whole speakeasy, packed to the brim with people, but the sound of her steps as she walked across the balcony to the stairs. She lingered for a moment when she reached the first step, letting her eyes take in everything in the speakeasy. Her view held at the door for a moment, but then she looked away and began making her way down the large grand staircase. When she reached the bottom she took Sam's hand and he escorted her across the room and up a much smaller flight of a mere five stairs to his private box, which presented not only a spectacular view of the stage, but a table for two and a candle lit dinner.[Chapter 5] Sam pulled out one of the chairs for Louella and helped her get seated before he sat down in his own chair. A waiter poured two glasses of champagne for them and exited the box. Louella elegantly took a sip from her glass, but all Sam could do was sit and stare. \"Wow,\" Sam said. It was all he could murmur, any more would overcome him. Louella smiled. \"What this, it's nothing.\" Sam didn't know whether to laugh or just stay in the state where he sat, eyes wide and mouth gaping. \"It is definitely not 'just nothing', it is everything, anything, pure perfection in one soul of perfect and eternal beauty.\" Sam blushed after he finished his extremely cheesy but still romantic statement. Louella blushed also and looked down. Sam grabbed her hand and, as she looked back up, looked into her eyes. \"This is you, Louella. You were meant to show your beauty, you were meant to flaunt how perfect and amazing you are.\" Louella, once again, blushed. The lights in the room dimmed and the ones on stage brightened. The dancers began running on stage in light blue beaded costumes and started singing. Louella though that it was actually cute, the way their short shorts, vests, and hats all matched covered in the same sky blue pearls. Sam moved his chair around the table and closer to Louella's, still holding her hand the whole while. \"Tell me this, Miss Louella,\" he started, \"Why did you come to New York in the first place?\" Louella though for a moment, even though she didn't need to, and then looked back to Sam. \"To live in a bigger world, one that I fit in. One that really felt like home. Back where I come everything was just so small and quiet, I didn't think I could stand it another second.\" Sam smiled at Louella. \"Well, you couldn't have ended up in a better place than here.\" As the lights to the first dancers song faded out sam leaned over and kissed Louella, and she kissed him back.[Chapter 6] She wasn't looking at the door when she stood at that staircase, she was looking at him. He just knew it, he knew it by how when their eyes met for what should have been a split second both their gazes lingered for what seemed like a lifetime. He almost dropped the pail of water he held when he saw her walk out of that room, but he caught it an inch above the floor. \"Dan, stop looking so 'dandy' and get back to work. You get paid to clean, not daydream.\" The waiter who had served Sam and Louella yelled at Dan, breaking him out of his thoughts. \"Sorry Knuckles,\" Dan said, hopping down off the bar and grabbing his rag. He wiped down the bar where he sat and began walking around the speakeasy. His gaze constantly flipped back to the box where Sam and Louella sat together, hand in hand. Dan had always hated Sam, he only took his job at the speakeasy out of a pure need for some money fast after he had moved to New York. In the four years he gad worked for Sam he hadn't been able to find another job, and now that he was stuck in a rut he hated himself for not trying harder. To sum it up, this girl was the turning point. He cringed when she met him at the bottom of the stairs, and it was even worse when he took her to his private table. Dan didn't know why, but there was just something different about this girl, the way her eyes shimmered and the way she seemed to float on air. But yet Sam had her, and there was nothing Dan could do. He sat down at what seemed to be the only empty table in the joint. It was covered in crumbs and some spilled soda pop, but he neglected to actually do his job and he watched the dancers. As they finished the song he took one last look at Sam and Louella just in time to see their lips meet in the darkness. He grabbed the ketchup off of the table and squeezed the bottle until it exploded. Just at that moment Knuckles walked by and gave him a nasty grin. Dan scowled and cleaned up the mess.

It's not like she liked bein"},{"Movie":"Darkman","Title":"An Unwanted Memory","Author":"Quazie89","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12239391","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's note: Hello, everybody! I'm sorry it's been awhile since I've written a story. I have all kinds of ideas I want to write. It's just writing them down that's the hard part. If you've been wondering what I've been into all of this time, I've been on a huge Liam Neeson kick for almost a year now, and I watched Darkman here awhile back. I think it's probably one of the best movies he's ever done. I also think it features some of the best acting he's ever done, and I just love the relationship between Julia and Peyton, so I just had to write a story for it. This one takes place during the movie/book and after Peyton comes back from the dead, but before Julia tells Louis that he is still alive and the famous elephant scene. I hope you enjoy it. I have more stories planned for other Liam Neeson movies in the feature, so don't be surprised if you see me post more fan fiction based on them. I think that's all for now. Sorry for the long author's note. I just wanted to let everybody know that I was still around and writing, but now we can get on with the story! An Unwanted Memory Julia couldn't believe it. Peyton was alive. Her Peyton. She hadn't almost wanted to believe it. After all of this time, she, thinking he had been dead, he had come back to her. She was almost mad at him, angry that he hadn't came to her sooner, but she was so happy to have him back she didn't want to stay mad at him, afraid he would be taken from her again. It all seemed almost too good to be true. Yet, he had called out to her while she had been in the graveyard, sitting crouched in front of his grave, and she had swerved around to the sound of his voice, even though she hadn't recognized it at first, hoping and fearing, at the same time, it belonged to who she thought had spoken, despite the staggering odds against such an unimaginable possibility. The doctors had told her they had found nothing left of him but one little piece of ear. Even if a person had survived all of that, they would've been in so much pain, for the rest of their meaningless existence, that such a life wouldn't be worth living, and she didn't want that for Peyton. She didn't want it for anybody. Julia, however, knew she wanted all of it to be true. The way she had held him in her arms that day in the graveyard, falling into his deep, warm embrace…She wanted it all to be real. She wanted Peyton to be real. The fire, much to her relief, hadn't changed him much. Wonder of all wonders, he was still the same old Peyton. The only thing that seemed to have changed was his usual deep, soothing voice, which was now raspy and hoarse, but still, somehow, beautiful. He also seemed stronger, somehow. Julia could sense a quiet, yet intimating strength about him that she hadn't been able to before, Peyton being the nerd that he had been. When she hugged him now, however, he felt bigger-built in the waist and arms, but he was still just as caring and loving as he ever was, her gentle giant, as always. She should've known something had been wrong. No one came out of a fire like that without a few burns and scars, not even Peyton, who, at the time they had been dating, had seemed so perfect and invincible to her. Oh, how young and naïve she had been. Sighing, Julia stood in front of the door to Louis Strack, Jr.'s office, tugging at her hair in frustration. She loved Peyton. She really did, but she couldn't go back to him the way he was now. She couldn't stand to see him like that. He had been so vulnerable and helpless, almost like a child. She never wanted to see him like that again. Taking a deep breath, Julia braced herself and stepped into Louis Strack's office. Louis Strack was, as usual, sitting behind his desk. He looked up and stood to his feet when she walked in, looking pleased to see her. \"Oh, hello, Julia,\" he said, motioning her to sit down in the seat in front of his desk. \"Make yourself comfortable.\" He sat back down himself, following her every movement with his eyes, which, for Julia, was more than a little unnerving. Julia forced herself to smile at him. \"Thank you, Louis,\" she said, sitting down on the chair he had indicated, relieved to get off her sore feet. After Julia had sit down, Louis leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers underneath his chin. \"How are things going?\" Julia was touched by his concern. \"I'm fine, thank you,\" she said, smiling at him. Louis nodded, strands of his shortly-cropped, russet hair falling over his forehead. \"That's good to hear,\" he said, a slow smile spreading across his handsome, angular face. \"Haven't had any interesting offers here lately, have you?\" Furious, Julia fumed, unable to believe he could be so forward. \"I'm not seeing anybody, if that's what you mean,\" she said, hoping Louis wouldn't question the matter further, and thought back on the last couple of times she had went out with Peyton. The first few dates they had gone on after he had 'come back from the dead' had gone great. She hadn't noticed anything strange about him on either one of them. They went to the movies, ate at restaurants, all of the normal things people did when they were dating. Nothing had went wrong and everything seemed right with the world. Things were going great until he had stayed over her at her apartment one night and she had mentioned the candles. The fucking candles. She wished she had never said anything about them. She had taken them out of the house afterwards. Anything that caused such a heartbreaking reaction in Peyton didn't need to be in her house. Julia couldn't tell Louis all of that, though. Peyton would be humiliated. Plus, Louis would be furious with her for not telling him Peyton was still alive sooner. Louis held his hands up in surrender. \"Relax, babe, I'm just messing with you,\" he said, laughing. \"Can't you take a joke?\" Julia turned away from Louis, lowering her gaze. \"I guess I can't,\" she said, frowning. Louis turned her around to look at him. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, and grabbed her by the arms, shaking her. Julia snapped her head up, trying to focus her gaze on Louis. \"Huh, what?\" she asked, when her eyes landed on Louis at last. Louis raised a disbelieving eyebrow at her. \"I asked you what was wrong,\" he said, repeating himself. Julia pinched her nose between her fingers, feeling a headache coming on. \"Nothing,\" she said, knowing Peyton would be embarrassed if she told Louis the story about the candles, not to mention angry at her for letting Louis have one on him. Louis leaned over his desk, placing his hands over the top of it. \"Bullshit, it's nothing,\" he said, grasping her hands in his. \"Something's bothering you.\" He bore his gaze into hers, making her feel uneasy. \"I can see it written all over your face.\" Julia pursed her lips. \"I said it was nothing, okay?\" She was getting annoyed. \"Just drop it.\" Letting go of her hands, Louis slammed his fist down on the table, making her jump. \"Damn it, Julia,\" he said, spittle flying out of his mouth. \"Why won't you tell me?\" Julia stared him down, refusing to give in. \"For no particular reason, really,\" she said, watching Louis stomp back and forth across the room with fascination. She was getting a nasty sense of satisfaction of seeing Louis rant and rave about the room. Sure, she and Louis had been going out long enough to be on first name basis now, and the two of them had agreed not to have any secrets between them, but that didn't mean she had tell him everything she had done that day. Louis banged his fist against the wall. \"Then why won't you tell me what's wrong?\" he asked, swirling around to glare at her. Almost overcome by an overwhelming wave of dizziness, Julia gripped the armrests of the chair, everything seeming to fade around her. \"Oh, don't worry,\" she said, hearing the tone of her voice growing distant. \"It's nothing personal.\" She felt like she was traveling to a different time and place, her mind going back to the night she had asked Peyton about the candles. On the night she had mentioned the candles, the two of them were sitting on the couch together, watching TV, much like the way they had used to do before the accident. The lights were on down low, Peyton's large, six-foot four frame was stretched out across the couch, his long, dangly legs hanging off the edge of the sofa, and she was laying across him with her head resting on his chest, her slender, narrow form nestled in the crook of one of his bulging arms. Peyton ran his big, awkward fingers through her golden hair, burying his face in her thick, fair curls. \"You don't know how lonely I've been,\" he said, pulling a lock of her out of her face. \"I've missed you so much.\" He kissed her on the cheek. Julia looked up at Peyton, giving him a grateful smile. \"I've missed you, too, Peyton,\" she said, reaching her hand up to rub his cheek. \"I love you so much.\" Peyton grabbed her hand, squeezing it. \"I love you, too,\" he said, kissing her hand. Julia looked around herself, in a daze, unable to believe her luck. After everything that had happened, she had never thought she would feel such happiness again. She felt like she was in a dream. She had Peyton back. He was alive and well. He had his health and she had hers. She had everything she had ever wanted. Still, she felt like something was missing, and she hated herself for it, knowing she should've been more grateful. She knew there were people, after all, who had been through fires and hadn't come out as lucky as Peyton, but she didn't know what it was she was missing until she leaned her head against Peyton's chest and roved her eyes around the room, her gaze landing on the candles she had set on the table next to the bed for just such an occasion. Peyton sensed something was bothering her. \"What's wrong?\" he asked, peering down into her face. Julia shook her head. \"Oh, nothing,\" she said, dismissing his concern with a wave of her hand. Peyton prodded her, giving her a playful nudge on the shoulder. \"Oh, come on, you can tell me,\" he said, and lowered his head, biting her neck. \"I won't tell anybody.\" Julia giggled, pushing him away. \"Oh, Peyton, stop it,\" she said, feeling her face blush a deep crimson. \"You're such a tease.\" Peyton grinned. \"I know,\" he said, sounding pleased with himself. Julia groaned. \"You're awful,\" she said, putting her hand over her eyes. Peyton pulled her hand away from her face, forcing her to look at him. \"Aw, now you've hurt my feelings,\" he said, his warm, blue eyes gleaming with a mischievous glint. \"In all seriousness, though, if it's something you're going to be embarrassed by, I promise I won't laugh,\" He gave her a sly wink, his gaze twinkling with mirth. \"Oh, it's nothing like that,\" Julia said, feeling guilty for making such a big deal over something so silly. \"You will probably laugh at me, though.\" Peyton continued to urge her on. \"Come on, then, tell me,\" he said, acting very much like a school boy. Julia looked away from Peyton, rolling her eyes. \"Oh, all right, then, but it's nothing,\" she said, her voice a low mutter. \"I just thought we could use some candles in here, is all.\" Peyton flinched, jerking awake from her. \"No, no candles,\" he said, his face turning white. \"Please, no candles.\" Much to Julia's horror, his lips started trembling, and tears started pouring down his pale face. Julia, started by Peyton's sudden, unexpected reaction, backed away from him. \"Peyton, honey, what's wrong?\" she asked. Peyton swallowed. \"Oh, nothing, Julia, it's just…\" he said, beginning to stammer. \"Ever since the fire…I just…I just can't stand the thought of candles, okay?\" Julia scooted back over to him, returning to his lap. \"Okay, no candles, then,\" she said, feeling sorry for him. \"I never should've mentioned them.\" She hated herself even more now, feeing like the lowest scum on the earth. \"I'm sorry.\" Peyton enfolded her in a warm, bone-crushing bear hug, his massive arms dwarfing her tiny waist. \"No, don't be sorry,\" he said, and pulled her away from him, giving her shoulders a gentle squeeze. \"It wasn't your fault.\" Turning sideways, Julia folded her arms under her breasts, leaning against Peyton's stomach. \"I should've known, though,\" she said, laying her hand on his heaving chest. \"I should've known that fire would've done something to you… changed you.\" She rubbed her hand down Peyton's chest, feeling for his heartbeat, just to reassure herself he was still alive. \"I think I did...but deep down, a part of me didn't want to accept it, you know?\" When she felt the rapid beating of his heart under her palm, she patted his stomach, a flood of relief washing over her. \"And I'm sorry for that, Peyton.\" Feeling disgusted with herself, she squeezed her hand into a fist. \"I really am.\" Peyton kissed her on the forehead. \"Don't be,\" he said, cupping her face in his hands. \"It wasn't your fault, all right?\" He rubbed her cheeks with his hands, narrowing his stern brow at her. \"You didn't know.\" He pulled his face away from hers, lowering his hands. \"It's my fault for not telling you before.\" He wrung his auburn hair through his fingers, a sure sign of nervousness if there ever was one. \"I'm the one who should be apologizing, not you.\" He lowered his hand, his arm shaking. \"I'm sorry.\" Julia still didn't feel reassured. She knew Peyton would say anything to make her feel better, but she didn't voice her doubts out loud. Instead, she closed her eyes, and, despite all of her troubling thoughts, somehow managed to fall asleep in Peyton's larger-than-life, yet comforting presence. Julia blinked, and shook her head, trying to clear the unwanted, but not altogether unpleasant memory from her mind. She was back in Louis' office, now, sitting in front of the man himself. She wondered where Peyton had gone after that accident. She knew he didn't have a home to go to, not after his apartment had burned down. She had offered to let him stay in her apartment on several occasions, but he had refused every time. Whether it was out of modesty or because of something else bothering him, she had no clue, but his behavior irked her. Louis' voice jerked her by the present. \"Now, where we?\" he asked, sounding as if he had calmed down some. \"Remind me, why did you come here today?\" Julia gave him a skeptical look. \"I have a job here to do, remember?\" she asked, unable to believe he had forgotten. \"I work here now.\" Louis pressed his hand against his forehead. \"Right,\" he said, sitting back down. \"Let's get back to business then, shall we?\" Julia, relived Louis was going to let it go, just nodded. She only wanted Peyton to be safe. Wherever he is, I just hope he's okay, and that he's in a good place, she thought, closing her eyes. Please, Peyton, just be safe. Coming back to his lab, on his way home from Julia's apartment, Peyton hung his head down, holding his face in his hands. Oh, you really fucked that one up, Westlake, he thought, cursing himself under his breath. Julia's never going to want to see you again. Not after that. She's going to think you're nothing but a big pussy now. He shook his head, looking back up to see where he was going. That was Darkman coming out, not Westlake. He ignored the strange looks he was getting from passerby. He had been getting used to them by now. When Peyton got to the lab, he staggered down the steps leading into the libratory, collapsing into a nearby chair. By the time he had gotten to the lab, the rest of Peyton Westlake's face had peeled off, revealing Darkman's bloodied, ravaged visage. The strips from his face hung down in tatters, falling down into his hands in jagged strips. Darkman snarled, glaring down at his hands. They aren't hands anymore , he thought, contorting his face into an expression of disgust. Now t hey're nothing but twigs for firewood. He winced and lowered his hands, turning away from them, an unanticipated, but not too shocking realization dawning on him. He knew he hadn't been afraid of the fire from Julia's candles. No, he had been afraid that, if she had lit them, and he had somehow managed to put one of his fingers through the fire by some freak accident, she would've seen the fire wouldn't have hurt him. He wouldn't have showed any signs of pain, and she would've thought he was some sort of freak. Hell, she probably already thought he was freak, after the way he had acted. Darkman wasn't afraid to admit that Peyton's skills as an actor were…lacking, to say the least, and they hadn't gotten any better. He thought his former shelf had put on the helpless schoolboy act a little too thick, but deep down he knew part of it hadn't been an act. Darkman snorted. He had found one thing Peyton still couldn't do, even with his newfound superhuman strength. Looked like all of the great powers he had just gained hadn't approved his acting abilities any. From a dark corner somewhere in the room, he heard a timid meow. \"Hello, kitty,\" Darkman said, relieved to see a familiar face this night. \"Come here, kitty.\" Turning around in his chair to face the direction from which he had heard the cat meow, he patted his ruined hands on his knees, coaching the cat to come from out of the darkness. The cat meowed, and slunk out of the shadows, approaching him with a tentative caution that broke his heart. Someone had hurt this cat, hurt it bad. Someone had beaten it and left it here in the lab to rot. For how long, Darkman didn't know. The cat had been in the lab when he had found it. He didn't know how the cat had gotten here, or what had happened to his previous owner. He didn't even know if its owner had given it a name, and he hadn't taken the time to give it one, but it had been one of the many things he had been meaning to do ever since he had gotten the lab. He was just glad to have another companion in the room he could talk to, even if that companion was a cat with hostile tendencies, a ferocious feral creature that hissed at him every now and then. Darkman grunted in surprise when, stopping at his feet, the cat leaped into his lap. \"Ah, hello, kitty,\" he said, trying to get his breath back. \"What have you been up to while I was gone?\" The cat just turned his head sideways to look at him, gave another meow, and curled up into his lap. The cat was asleep within seconds. Darkman chuckled. \"Good kitty,\" he said, calmed in an instant by the cat's contented purrs. \"Just don't get too comfortable.\" He scanned his weary, yet still unwavering gaze across the room. \"We've got work to do.\" The End ","Summary":" Author's note: Hello, everybody!

It was a dark, bright and shiny night in the city of Los Angeles, the streets are crowned, and local prostitutes are out looking for action with local johns. At Hollywood Blud, a strawberry blonde-haired, young woman is walking past several other local prostitutes where she is being spotted by a local pimp in a shiny gold Cadilliac, she sees him and she start running.

They were awesome movies though a little sad. Here is just a short poem about Payton's life after his accident. It turned out a little dark (no pun intended) but this was the mood that I personally felt at the end of all the movies. Please enjoy and review! Darkness, a thing that all mortals fear, Devoid of laughter and cheer. Away from all that is divine, It causes chills to climb up spines. Men stand straight with their foolish pride, Try as they might, they slowly die inside. Bravely they fight this empty abyss, Soon they question why they exist. This enigma is were I thrive Caught in this evil, somehow I survive. All that I loved was stolen away. I was left for dead, to slowly decay. But somehow, by Gods blessing or spite, I came back into this never ending night. Days went by, weeks came and went Yet I was still caught in my torment. The answer alludes me, right out of my range.

Stuff like that. FHOD not mine. Fanfic only. Don't hate. Chapter 1 The forest was dark and quiet. The Flying Daggers clan had scurried back to their homes for an upcoming storm. But Leo just looked up to the darkening sky. The raindrops filled his eyes, as if Mei were there, weeping into him. How could he betray her? For three years he tried to find her and marry her, but she fell for that stupid amateur, Jin, in three days! He looked down at his soaked clothes and sighed, walking back home to his hut in the forest, the only existence he had away from the Flying Daggers and Government. \"Lougi, I'm home.\" He called as he walked into the house doors. \"Mew,\" was his response. While walking through the forest he found a cold, hungry kitten buried alone under a pile of leaves. He kept the kitten as his own, naming him Lougi. He became Leo's only beloved friend. The young cat pranced to greet him. Leo smiled down at the cat and scratched him on the head. Not much had changed about Leo since his betrayal to the Government; his hair had grown longer and thicker and facial hair began to grow. His clothes were tattered and worn by all the weather. His appearance hadn't changed much in two years, only dark circles hung like moons under his eyes. He rose and walked to the edge of the hut where he laid his sword on a mat. The hut was small with a fire pit in the middle and two beds; one for him and a small one for Lougi. He sat down by the dying fire, fed it with twigs, and placed a tea cup beside it. Leo noticed something odd in the hut. He sensed some kind of foulness in the air. He looked around when he noticed a dark figure. \"They said you were part of the Flying Daggers.\" Leo jumped to his feet. Lougi ran underneath a pillow. A woman dressed in the Flying Daggers uniform emerged from the shadows, her long hair tied back and her lips painted blood red. \"Who are you?\" He asked sternly. The mysterious woman smiled. \"That is unimportant.\" Leo stared at the woman confused. \"What do you want?\" \"Nia sent me.\" \"What for?\" The woman took a step toward him, and he stepped opposite. She smiled again, but in an evil way. \"She requests a conference with you.\" Later Leo walked through the doors of the Flying Daggers. He gasped at how the main room had been fancied much more; the stone had been polished and all the leaves had been swept up. On the walls hung beautiful curtains and tapestries that told of the Flying Daggers history. Nia was seated at a small table with her green robe and hat that covered her face. \"Please sit, Leo.\" She said, stretching her arm out toward a cushion on the ground perpendicular to her. He sat down slowly, as she regained her hand position. A servant came by and served tea to the two. Nia sipped her tea in silence. \"You wished to see me…\" Leo finally said, shaking nervously. Nia lifted her head. \"Yes. It's about Mei; Mei's daughter.\" There was a long silence between them. Leo was flabbergasted. \"Mei's daughter? \" \"One would assume so. Mei and this young woman are very alike. She told me her story and I believed her to be Mei's kin. I asked her is she knew anyone of the name, but she said not. She could be Mei's reincarnation, possibly her twin.\" Leo was stunned, but also happy. His true love was alive! \"What's her name?\" Nia eyed him coldly. She remembered how dreadful he was to Mei once they had met after three years. \"You do not have an easy hand with me, you know.\" \"I understand, but I regret every action I cast on Mei.\" He looked her in the eye, hoping she would hear him out. She sipped her tea and sighed. \"Her name is Izra.\" \"May I see her?\" Nia set her tea down. She sat in silence for a moment until finally speaking. \"Like Mei, Izra is strong. She will not be hurt by you like Mei was. I will not let that happen either. I will let you see her, but you must pass three tests. Your first test will begin tomorrow at sunrise. Do you understand?\" \"I understand, Ma'am.\" Leo bowed his head toward her. Nia looked up at him. \"Do not force me to stain my dagger with your blood once again, Leo.\" She said standing up, Leo following. A servant came by and picked up the tea cups. \"We're through here for now. I will be expecting you tomorrow. Do not be late.\" She said and walked out of the room. Leo bowed behind her and exited the Flying Daggers with a smile spread across his face. As he headed back to his home, he knew this time he would not make the same mistake again. He could finally redeem himself to the Flying Daggers and even Mei. Tomorrow would be a good day.[Chapter 2] Sorrynguys for the LONG delay. I was on fiction press. P Thanx for thenreviews! I love you all! smooch and thanx for the info Birdie!nTruly helpful :D. Oh, I introduce a new character. MINE... Chaptern2 \" MEI!\" He screamed, cradling her in thencold snow. Blood poured from her stiff body onto the white ground. Shenwas gone; never to return. The next thing he saw was a fading face of thenwoman he loved, and then, the roof of his home. Leo sat up, slowly,nand looked around. Putting a hand to his aching head, he laid downnagain. That day still haunted him. Why did he do that to her? If hendidn't hurt her they would have been happily married. But thennagain, she would have been with Jin instead. I'm an idiot…I'mna fool… he thought. Even if Izra did accept me… Oh damn. He jumped up and grabbed his clothes, puttingnthem on without a care in the world whether they were backwards,nupside down, or unsightly. He tied his hair in a half bun, and afternbidding Lougi a goodbye, he ran outside. The sun was nearly risingnover the forbidden sky. Relieved, he mounted his horse and rode outntoward the Flying Daggers. He wouldn't mess up anymore. Somewherenelse All was well. General Queda stared at the softnplains of the forest. It was going to be his now. He had successfullynover-thrown the Emperor two years ago and now he was able to becomenthe new one. The first thing he had to do was get rid of those sillyndagger people. After he succeeded with that, he would exterminatenthat foolish Leo. Queda was born with immense fame. His fathernwas a general in the government who had fought in many famousnbattles. His horrible mother was with the flying daggers. She was sonoverprotective of him, always telling him to never be like hisnfather…that he would become an undisciplined being and he would bena terrible leader. She was killed by Queda's father much later. Butnthat was what Queda's goal was; to become the leader. He wantednmore fame than he had now, and he definitely wanted to be the leader. \"Sir, mission; ambush with flames, hasnsucceeded!\" A man announced to Queda. \"Are they ALL dead?\" Queda firmly asked. Henwanted to make sure no one would run away and rebuild the clan later. \"Yes sir! We sent out our men to scout for survivors, so far, we'venfound none.\" Queda smiled evilly. Daggers down; Leo's death, next. Later It was suspiciously quiet in the forest at thatntime of the day. Leo looked around, as he jumped off his horse andntied its rein to a tree. The whole forest was bleached a brightngreen. There was no other color, where as, you had to be the bestneyed human to walk through the forest without bumping into a tree.nThe leaves were the same color as well. The leaves piled on thenground like a Slowly, Leo walked through the forest.nSomething was definitely not right. He took a few steps, and suddenlynheard a startling crunch. He looked down. It was a single black leaf,nwhich made the whole forest look crooked just by its color. He bentndown and touched it, startled by the warmth it gave. A black leaf?nWhat is this, misfortune? He thought. He felt a softness settle on his head and feltnit. It was a fallen leaf from the trees above. This one wasn'tnblack, but healthy. Suddenly, there was a heavy weight on his backnthat pushed him down. He was straddled, and a familiar, but sternnvoice came to his ear, before his eyes were forced into darkness. \"Don't worry; Death doesn't bite wherenyou're going.\" Ya!nChapter 2!

The room he was in was cold and smelly, and itnseemed like there was someone…or some people in the room with him.nHe was laying stomach down behind two people who were facing a fire.nTheir backs were facing Leo, and their hair was tied up in a bun onntheir heads. Quietly, Leo tried to get the rope off of his hands andnfeet, when something startled him. There was Izra, right beside him. She was lying like Leo was, but herneyes were closed. Her hair was down and frizzed, and her kimononseemed worn with dirt. \"Izra!\" Leo scooted toward her, whispering. \"Hey, shut up!\" One of the two people threw a piece of stalenbread at him, hitting him in the forehead. Leo flinched. He looked at Izra again, before he fell into annunexpected sleep. What happened? Leo's Dream \" IZRA!\" He screamed, cradling her in thencold snow. Blood poured from her stiff body onto the white ground. She was gone; never to return. \" HOW COULD YOU?\" He gently placed his beloved in the snow andndrew his knife. \"I'LL KILL YOU!\" Leo'sncold voice faded away as he awoke. The sunlight shone in the room andnon his face. Izra was gone, and his hands were untied. She hadnprobably snuck out and forgot him. He began to look for a way out,nbut he stopped. This room was so familiar, but the walls werenbleached black and beaten rags hung amongst them. He knew he hadn'tnbeen there for a long time but, why did he feel so at home? 1\" Sir!nSchließlich sind Sie wach !\" A female voice rang behindnhim. He turned his head and a white haired, tan girl ran up next tonhim.2 \" Wir müssennjetzt gehen, bevor mehr der Männer kommen !\" She grabbednhis arm, pulled him up, and ran with him into a long hallway. \"W-wait, I…I um...uh. Wha-\" Leo stammerednas she dragged him along. The government's men ran toward them. Shengrabbed her daggers with the other hand and flung them at them. Theynall fell to the floor. She stopped suddenly and signaled to Leo to benquiet. She tip toed to the end of the hallway and looked down thenstairs. Suddenly, Izra appeared, looking rushed. \"I've got them stalled for now, run!\" Shenpushed both of them down the opposite way. They ran into the room andnstopped. 3\" Eingeschlossen !\"nThe girl with the white hair said. \"No, wait.\" Izra ran to one of the corners. Leo sat and stared at Izra, wide eyed. Hencouldn't believe he was actually spending some time with thenincarnation of the only woman he ever loved. Izra was just like Mei;nshe was swift as a butterfly. She sped around the room so gracefully.nHe couldn't help but wonder if she really was her! Leo removed hisngaze. Stop it . He told himself. Focus on what'snhappening. \"Um…e-ex-excuse me, uh…what-what's going on?\" Leonstuttered. Izra whipped her head around to look at him,nand then turned it back to look at the wall. \"We're in thenGovernment's quarters. I know how to get out. Don't worry I-\"nshe jerked back for a moment. The wall which she was inspecting flewnback and into the stiff grass of the forest. \"Run! Hurry!\" Izranmotioned to the both of them to follow her through the hole. They ran past tall trees and parades of rocks until they finallynstopped. They fell to the ground and panted hard. \"We should be (pant) safe here.\" Izra sighed in relief. Leo sat up to face her. \"Izra?\" Izra looked at him. Their eyes met; again. She smiled, \"Hello,nLeo.\" \"You know my name?\" Leo asked, shocked. \"Yes…I was supposed to train with you, Nia told me.\" Izranlooked beside her. A deer took a leaf off one of the trees and atenit, gracefully. \"But then the government came. They took there gunsnand torches and ripped the forest apart. The last thing I remember isnmy garden; it was burning. It was like my whole life was flashingnbefore my eyes.\" She closed her eyes. Leo swallowed hard. He feltnso much pity for her. Izra wiped her face and sighed. \"Well um, this is Kina.\" She pointed to the woman with the whitenhair. 4\" Hallo !\"nKina waved. Leonlooked confused, but waved back. \"Oh, she's a German. She justnsaid hello.\" Izra said. Leo nodded in understanding. There was ansmall silence in between them. Then Izra stood up. \"We've got tongo to the House of Flying Daggers. We need to look for survivors.\"nLeo stood up as well and nodded. Theirnjourney was finally beginning. 1 Sir!

The policeman at the tape line hadn't been kidding. It was awful. On a sudden urge, he checked her cell phone, the time stamps on the texts she'd just gotten from Julie Westlake. The coroner looked at her pityingly, and pressed a hand to the back door of his van. Even if he would have let her, she wouldn't have dared to look at the body. The fire had been brought down under control, the explosion had happened only twenty minutes before. The pile of burning debris, the ash, was still burning is some places. She could see though the end of the building to the other side where a new sign was going up for rental boats. It would happen just as she came back home. She turned to the officer who had walked up beside her. \"You didn't find another body?\" He shook his head, and seemed uncertain how much more to indicate. Gail just walked away from him and into the mess of a bottom floor, her shoes hissing as she stepped on a hot board. She combed through some of the papers that hadn't been touched, kicked over a pile of charred wood, half hoping she would find something to make sense of. A fireman had followed her in, and cleared his throat. \"Far as we can see, a lighter got too close to some of the chemicals.\" \"But, they didn't smoke.\" \"It's a lab; maybe they needed it for an experiment.\" She knew he meant well, but she wanted desperately to hit someone until they bled. Instead, she reached down and pulled out a picture that had mostly survived the fire. The frame had protected all except the edges. Drawing in a ragged breath, she broke away the melted back and dropped the glass. Someone called to the fireman, and he left her to wander the open area. She found a stack of disks, marked with crazy names and numbers. The backup for the research. Tucking them into a plastic bag that had been in her coat for a year, she dropped them and the photo inside and rummaged, hoping for a few more keepsakes. She found a file that had been seared, but the main body remained intact. A few more papers, discs, and another photo. It was Peyton and Julie's wedding picture. They were grinning hugely from behind an iron railing strung with ribbon and flowers. Julie still had that horrible perm, but it worked under the veil. Turning around to look at the embers of the building, Gail measured up the remains of her parents' lives. She began chanting to herself her mantra for the year: \" I'm seventeen, I can handle it. I'm Seventeen, I can handle it.\"[Chapter 2] 2 The investigators had spent the past year trying to convince Gail Westlake that there was nothing else to find. It was unfortunate, but her parents had died while working. A mistake, an accident, the end. She refused to accept it. The synthetic skin was too important to her Dad to take risks of any kind. Her Mom had been too vigilant to let him make an oversight. It didn't add up. Somehow they let her keep it open for nearly twelve months before slamming the door shut. They need the money and manpower elsewhere. During the initial investigation, a cop, only a few years older than she was caught her in the hallway, and whispered, \"I'm not supposed to say anything, and I can't do anything about this. But there's talk that a guy named Robert G. Durant was there. I don't know why, but if he was there, he'd have been involved. Don't let his business man persona fool you. He likes to bake pies and then stick his fingers in them.\" He relaxed a little. \"I really am sorry about your folks, and if there's something I can do, let me know. Just don't tell anyone I told you. And don't tick him off if you ever do meet him. I don't want to scrape you off the pavement.\" At least it gave her a name, something to look at after everyone said there was nothing more to it. It was probably the most comforting thing anyone had done for her during the whole ordeal. The cop's name was Benny Prickles, a fact no one let him forget. His girlfriend was a dispatcher named Marcy. They took the shell-shocked Westlake girl under their scrawny but welcoming wings. She spent hours talking to them (or listening to them) while helping Marcy convert files from paper to computers. It was there she saw what Benny meant about Durant. He cropped up far too often to be an innocent bystander. How he connected to her parents, she didn't ask, and never saw. Somehow it seemed a random event, particularly in view of how he normally appeared. Over the course of time, she was hired by the police to do odd jobs around the building. Gail often suspected Benny of hinting to his superiors that she needed the work and it would help her move on. Besides, she had lab experience; she could help downstairs, right? She owed Benny, if that were the case. It had helped to keep her from going batty for the next year and a half. Her mind was jerked rudely back to the present by a shout from the lab tech behind her, slapping at an intern. \"You think that's anyway to mix that junk? That's why the sticks are there, numbskull.\" Henrietta turned brown eyes flashing from an equally brown face on Gail. \"You're done. Get out.\" Gail smiled, and left the building. It would do no good arguing with the giant woman. She hailed a cab and went to her parents' grave. Sitting with her back against the warm rock, she closed her bright blue eyes, and relaxed a little. \"I've tried, Mom. Really tried. I guess I've said that? Yeah, thought so. I'm nineteen now, and I hate it. Do you know what an apartment goes for? I'm still looking for one with some privacy. I'd be happy if I could find an upper floor, or back rooms. Most of them are so high I'd have to make double what I do to pay for it alone. How did you and Dad do it?\" The stone had their names, dates of birth and dates of death. Only one urn of ashes had been placed below, only one body had been uncovered. She ran a fingernail inside the carved letters, digging out moss and dirt. There was no reason to keep coming back, she scolded herself. It was not accomplishing anything beyond reminding her of her loss. Her parents had always told her to live, to move on. Julie especially. She could remember her mother comforting her after a fake friend had turned coats. Her blonde hair and clear look as she stroked her daughter's arm gently. \"Sweetie, it's okay. It won't feel that way for a while, but eventually you'll find a better friend.\" Peyton had been leaning on the counter, and raised an eyebrow. \"Until then, you'll just have to make do with Mom and me.\" Julie shot him a glare, telling him he was not helping. He gave her a face that asked what? Didn't they care enough to be friends? \"Don't let one bad friend ruin your life. Just live it, and let the world be jealous.\" Standing, Gail walked around to the other side where she'd had their pictures carved, and nearly fell over a large bundle of yellow roses. She looked for a card or mark of some kind, but there was nothing. They were fresh enough they couldn't have been there for more than a day. She looked around, but all she could see was a homeless man wrapped in a giant coat moving slowly along behind his shopping cart, head down. Her nearly black hair blew into her face, and she pushed it behind her ears impatiently. It wasn't the first time she'd found flowers or items on the grave, usually several days after the fact. It was becoming disturbing. It was starting to get dark by then, so she decided to leave. She returned to the microscopic house she shared with three other girls, all in college. They were into each other's things constantly, including hers. It was only a matter of time before they would have snooped in her parents' things, so she'd put on a show one night as supper, crying hysterically, telling about the last year without them and how she just couldn't face it. Then, with an almost ceremonial resolve, she put everything in a lockbox under the bed. A few sniffles on the anniversary of the Westlakes' death had reinforced the barrier around her memories, and what was left of her father's research was safe. Not that any of them would have knowingly hurt her or revealed something, but it was something she was not willing to risk at that point. They were in the middle of a Nickolas Sparks marathon when she walked in; each of them had at least two friends there. The kitchen and living room were joined, and every flat surface was being used to hold a girl or a soda pop and chocolate bar. Gail had forgotten it was Friday. \"This is one where someone dies in the end, right?\" She quipped on her way through, earning a glare from Chris. At least she had her room and the bathroom to herself for an hour. She showered, and went the room she shared with Danita. Pulling the box out, Gail chose a disk she hadn't looked at yet. As expected, it didn't play in her laptop any better than the others had. She just didn't have the set up to read it. Putting it away, she looked through the mangled papers again, hoping she could understand just a little more this time around. These readings were usually met with better luck, but it was rapidly getting past her Lone Ranger routine. She needed to find somebody in the same line of work as her father to explain what she was looking at. Preferably someone she could trust to keep their mouth shut. The sound of shuddering tears cued her to put everything away, and find a pair of PJs that were cleaner than the rest, and crawl into bed. As she did, a newspaper in the trash caught her eye. Opening it up, she found the racy headline stating \" Darkman on the Prowl: Who is he targeting now?\" The article only took up about three inches of print, with a picture twice that size showing a poorly lit, grainy shot of someone running off. It could have been anyone, of almost any description. It was just a blur on the page. At the station, the police were getting fed up with the Darkman. He was scaring entire neighborhoods, and a few people were starting to claim he was responsible for any heinous act they happened to witness where there were no suspects. One person claimed they had seen him lift two fully grown men, one in each hand and toss them aside after taunting them with questions. Other than the fact he was tall and strong, there was no other description. Some of the college friends her roommates brought around claimed he was an alien, or ghost. She'd heard that he was hired muscle, or criminal. Or a criminal trying to make up for his past. But those were just rumors, and if anyone knew anything for certain, they weren't talking. She set the paper on her nightstand, folded so the article and picture showed. Flicking off the lamp, she eyed the blotch the picture made in the shadowy room. If this Darkman were real, it opened up a world of possibilities.[Chapter 3] 3 Gail's eyes snapped open to a squeal from one of her roomies. Chris or Jenna from the sound of it. Danita couldn't sound like a girl to save her life. Rolling out of the quilt, she hung her head between her knees and stretched until her hands touch the floor. The sound came again, and she pushed her hair out of her face, and wrapped her robe around herself determined that if she had to die, it would be modestly. Waddling out, she found not an invader, but her three co-renters at the window, bouncing up and down excitedly. \"What's going on? I though you guys were being mauled.\" She opened the fridge and decided that was not a good idea. It was as barren as the Sahara. What there was had a think growth of fuzz going. \"Look at that guy.\" They all said in unison. Somehow that just made it creepy. She shuffled over, and saw a motorcycle with a man on it. He was lighting a cigarette, and looking at the houses around him. He pulled out a paper, and checked it against the houses again. He had a long buzz of red-ish hair, and an almost too perfect tan. He was one of those people who seem better than they are. Gail had seen her share at the station over the past year. With a grunt, she returned to the kitchen to consume a raw pop-tart and a gallon of coffee. The girls started jabbering, and suddenly fell silent as the bell rang. They stared at each other, and then Danita inched over and opened it. \"Yes?\" The Motorcycle Man stood there, smiling charmingly. His eyes roved over the other two girls who had followed her to the door, and the smile wavered uncertainly. \"Is there a Miss Gail B. Westlake here?\" Three sets of eyes turned to a slouched figure at the table pushing dark hair back. She stood up and made her way over. \"Who are you?\" She demanded. \"Cole Madison. I work for the police.\" He gave her an ID, which she handed back within a few seconds. Returning to her pitiful breakfast, she looked back at him thoughtfully. \"What do you want me for, Mr. Madison?\" He glanced at the other girls uncomfortably. \"I…was given your name by Officer Prickles.\" The usual snickers followed this statement. He shot a look over his shoulder and sat down. \"Look, Benny said you have a good nose for stuff that's…off. I got a really weird case, and the department said as long as I hired someone already employed by the police, I could get help. At least come and take a look at what I've got and then decide?\" Shoving the box of pop-tarts over to him, she poured him a cup of coffee. \"My usual salary?\" \"No, you'll get a sizable bonus. There is a risk factor.\" He refused the tarts, and swallowed the coffee in three seconds. \"Can you come now?\" Eyeing him, Gail could see that he was really unhappy about something. Nodding she stood and waddled back to the bedroom. \"Give me twenty minutes.\" Gail slid off the motorcycle, not sure if she liked it or not. Her shoulder length hair had been semi-permanently blown back where the helmet had not covered it. Raking it into a ponytail, she followed Cole into an old warehouse, marked as storage for a company. He nodded at the guard and opened a side door, showing that it was a police run facility. There was some equipment, mostly vehicles and computers. Five motorcycles identical to the one outside were parked in a neat row with a couple of cars and a van. There was a gap where another motorized item would go, but it was out for whatever reason. A makeshift kitchen and living area showed that nights could be passed there as well. Cole started a computer with three letters on the cover; DDO. \"Whatever I show you, never happened. Even if you decide to help and mostly if you don't.\" She nodded, and sat backwards on a chair to look. He drew a breath and pulled up a list of names, dates and places. \"These are all occurrences with the same factor, mostly built on witness statements. If you want to walk after I tell you what, I won't blame you.\" He paused and let out the air he'd been holding. \"It's Robert Durant. Please don't laugh.\" She didn't. Instead she took the laptop and read the list. \"That may be the only factor that matters if it can be proven.\" The undercover cop took a second to understand what she was saying. \"Wait, you're going to help? Really?\" \"Yeah, why not? I can do part of it at the station anyway so no one will notice anything.\" His face lit up and he took the computer again, pulling up a file of statements. \"A lot of these sightings happen in this general area. A few outside, but it helps narrow down places to look. I mean, he's nearly untouchable, that's why I'm pretending to ferret out sources and not him. You do realize what can happen to people who get in his way?\" His face fell at that part. She nodded, recalling the wreckage of her former home. Cole went on. \"I have an informant, but he won't agree to come forward. So, whatever we find is up to us to substantiate.\" \"Sounds fun.\" Gail recalled the amounts of files in the stations, and shuddered. \"There's another guy, kind of a pain, but he'll help and keep quiet. I'd rather not introduce you to either until the time comes. Just in case.\" \"I get it already. I'm another snoop.\" She said impatiently. \"What do I do?\" He grinned, and handed her a paper. \"Next week, I'll pick you up after work. Just tell them I'm a boyfriend or cousin or something. Mostly, we just walk around trying to see anyone we can take in and question. A lot of street folk and the working class have connections to Durant somehow.\" \"Follow drugs, money, and so on?\" \"Exactly.\" Gail grinned back. After being caught in hiatus for so long, it felt good to move. ","Summary":" 1 Gail stepped out of the cab, her eyes looking slowly over the mess.

Into The Night Some fear the night. They avoid it, shun it,rnstay in the light of the day, where all is visible and there are no dark,rnhidden corners and faces. Others embrace the night, and are embraced by it.rnThese people feel no fear in the dark, they use it as a cloak, a shroud, arnshelter from everything. They do not walk through the world at night, they walkrnpast it. You can pass these people on the nighttime streets and not even knowrnit. You may look straight at them and yet not see them; and, likewise, do notrnpresume that they see you. One suchrnman walks the night in this fashion. He is walking it now. His name was oncernPeyton Westlake. He now goes by the name 'Darkman'. He lives in shadow, andrnhides in plain view. He is everywhere and nowhere, everyone and no one. He isrnknown of many, but few know who he is. He is a man of contradictions, never stable.rnAfter being brutally beaten and burned, he was subjected to an experimentalrntreatment for burns victims - he can feel no pain, but as a result isrnemotionally unstable, given to mood swings and outbursts of violent intensity,rnfurther fuelled by the increased levels of adrenaline that grant him (or cursernhim with) strength beyond that of ordinary men. But he has fears too. He fearsrnthat he will remain a monster (for that is how he sees himself) forever. Hernfears that he will never be able to make a life with the woman he loves, and hernalso fears for her safety - he is a scientist, and he knows that he isrndangerous. But he doesrnnot fear the night. Perhaps he should. And perhaps he soon will. ToddrnMurphy, on the other hand, does fear the night. Unfortunately, he has littlernchoice but to walk it. The night patrol list never seems long enough. His namernkeeps coming back around again. Last time he was on night patrol, he saw thernDarkman for the first time, and look what happened then. He discovered that hisrnpolice chief, Claude Bellisarius, controls most of the city's organised crime,rnaccepting bribes to allow certain...private enterprises to conduct theirrnoperations, unhindered by such slight inconveniences as the strong arm of thernlaw. This alsornscares Todd Murphy. But what scares Todd Murphy even more is the prospect ofrnmeeting the Darkman again in one of these back streets. An uneasy ally, thernDarkman , thinks Murphy, who cares not for justice, but revenge . Andrnnothing will stand in the way of that desire for revenge, he knows. Murphy doesrnnot require revenge, of course. He wants to see Bellisarius pay for his crimes.rnThe man must be punished for his wrongdoing. That isn't revenge. That'srnjustice. What Murphyrndoesn't want, is to meet the Darkman. But we don't always get what we want. Andrnsometimes, that turns out to be a good thing. Eventually. There isrnanother who walks abroad on this particular night who does not fear it, but notrnone who walks with the subtlety and calm of those like the Darkman. Thisrnindividual has need for neither. He simply stalks the back-alleys and by-ways,rnfulfilling his task. Smackwater Jack is a hitman. His modus operandi reflectsrnhis night-walking - crude, but effective. He does not go by his real name, thatrnwould be foolish, so his pseudonym, as with so many such pseudonyms, describesrnhim in some way. He is named for a song. He cannot sing, but he does carry arnshotgun. One of many from his collection, customised and personalised. The modelrnhe carries now, concealed under his heavy coat, and attached to it by means ofrna holster that he himself invented, with adjustable straps and a quick-releasernclasp, is one of his favourites. It is surprisingly compact. Triple-barrelled,rnsawn at the ends, maximised for a closed-cluster hit, and with clumps of threernshells lined up along the top of the extended grip on metal tracks. He canrnreload this gun in 1.25 seconds. It is designed for a specific purpose, a quickrnhit. That is what he wants tonight. He knows that his target is dangerous, hernwill not get more than one chance to dispatch him. Jack has estimated that,rnwith luck, he will have the chance to fire off two rounds. That, he guesses,rnwill take about 3 seconds. Six shells will be enough, he knows, to obliteraternhis target's chest. Death will be guaranteed. Jack smilesrnto himself, and walks faster. The Darkmanrnis not happy. It's been a lousy week. Not even backing Bellisarius into arncorner over the prostitution racket has cheered him up. He doesn't want to hidernbehind the shelter of blackmail, he wants revenge. But this, he supposes willrndo for now. He'd be furious if he wasn't so tired. Even with increased levelsrnof adrenaline, three or four days and nights with no sleep will push a man tornexhaustion. And he has still made no breakthrough with his work. Not that hernexpected to, of course, not so soon, but he had hoped to get further than this.rnNot even his newfound knowledge that he can consciously improve and sharpen hisrneyesight has helped him. He can see the cells of the artificial skin he createsrnmore clearly, but it hasn't led him to any new knowledge, no way of extendingrnthe skin's 99 minutes of life except by darkness. And he hasn't seen Julie again.rnHe knows that he shouldn't because he knows, intellectually, that there is nornhope for their relationship under these circumstances, and being with her againrnwould only make his longing worse, and the distance between them greater. Butrnhe wants to see her so much, cannot bear this being away from her. It isrntearing him apart, more than any explosion ever could. He can feelrnhimself getting worked up, feels the grief well up inside him, so he tries tornextend his senses to calm his overwrought emotions. He stands still, a darkrnfigure in a dark night down a dark alley, and listens, and looks. He hears thernscraping of an alley rat, foraging for scraps to feed on. As he turns his headrnand peers harder into the gloom, he sees it scrabbling around, desperate tornfind something hidden in the night that it did not have before. The Darkmanrnwatches, fascinated, as another rat approaches it from behind and attacks,rnready to steal what has been uncovered by its kinsman, not caring that itsrnunfortunate victim has found nothing. As bloodrnbegins to flow in a futile, pointless struggle, the Darkman turns away. He doesrnnot like mirrors, and the animal kingdom can often seem as such. He is aboutrnto withdraw into himself once more and head back to what he must now call home,rnwhen he hears something from the next alley that does not sound like an animal,rnat least not of the smaller variety. He moves quickly to the wall, flatteningrnhimself just around the corner from the Noise. He concentrates harder, noticesrnthe shadows deepen as his hearing is given priority over his eyesight. Thernscientific part of his mind files this new experience away for laterrnconsideration. The rest of him tenses; few walk these alleys, and fewer arernfriendly. Whoever isrnapproaching is doing so slowly, carefully, deliberately, silent to an ordinaryrnear. By the length of the stride, the Darkman estimates that the Walker is arnfew inches short of being six feet tall. He listens harder, and hears anotherrnsound, besides those of footsteps. It is barely audible, a muffled thump, hernhears it between each step, a regular rhythm. Something swinging at thernWalker's side? Muffled...probably by a coat, perhaps under the coat. Not at thernWalker's side, though - the sound would be intermittent, not striking the bodyrnon every step, not when the Walker walks so stealthily. The Whatever-it-is mustrnbe in front of the Walker, attached to the inside of Its coat. Not long, butrnquite heavy. A sawn-off shotgun? A footrnappears from around the corner. The Walker has arrived. The next foot isrnaccompanied by a trenchcoat and a head, which turns to look down the alley andrnwhose eyes barely have time to register the large, black-clad man in front ofrnthem. The Darkman lashes out. SmackwaterrnJack was not happy. He didn't like it when time slowed to a crawl, as it alwaysrnseems to do when one is falling. This must be the Darkman , he thinks asrnhe falls back under the force of the sudden attack. As he falls, he reachesrninside his coat for his gun, moving as if through treacle. How did he know? he asks himself, as the clasps pop open and he points his shotgun outward. Forrnthe first time, Jack fears his prey. Perhaps this is why, as he fires his gun,rna fraction of a moment before he feels the impact of the ground, his aim isrnoff. The Darkman stumbles as the shells tear through his thigh, but continuesrnhis advance. Timernreturns to its normal state, Jack rolls to the right, rises to one knee againstrnthe side of the alley away from the corner he turned around, breaks, reloadsrnand snaps the gun barrel back into place in one fluid motion. He brings his gunrnup once more, sees the Darkman and fires. This takes less than three seconds.rnJack almost forgets to reload his gun when he sees the Darkman still coming,rnuntouched by the second round. The gun is still pointing down when the Darkmanrnreaches him and rewards his hesitation with a two-handed clubbing. So fast ,rnJack thinks as he races down that black tunnel to unconsciousness. He reachesrnoblivion before his head hits the ground, and does not see the Darkman collapsernagainst the wall, leaving blood on the grimy brick, clutching his left side. Notrnfast enough , thinks Darkman as the alley dissolves around him. A darkness as deep as the night in which he seeks shelterrndescends upon him.[Chapter 3] 3. Dawn Breaks It was when he heard the gunshots that Todd Murphy wished hernwas somewhere else. Anywhere in the whole world, really. He wasn't picky. Justrnnot here, and not definitely not now. He ran toward what he thought was roughlyrnthe direction of the noise, a feeling of dread growing in the pit of hisrnstomach. Murphy sincerely hoped this was nothing to do with Darkman. He knewrnthat it was more likely than not, though even Dr Campion at the hospital hadn'trnseen him since that time five weeks ago. The man freaked him out. There was anrnintensity to him that Murphy found disturbing. And Murphy really didn't likernthe dark. But still he ran on, toward his duty. It took himrnover forty minutes to find the place. The back alleys of the city are a maze.rnIt is not unknown for wayward travellers to fall foul of the denizens here,rnwhere perpetual twilight reigns during the day, and a deep darkness falls atrnnight. Few of these denizens are foolish enough to attack an armed, nervousrnpolice officer chasing a gunshot of course, but Murphy was not to know this.rnNor would this knowledge have made any difference to his state of mind. Fearrnwill do that to a man. Murphyrnarrived on the scene breathless, gun in hand. There was nobody to shoot at,rnonly a figure, prostrate on the ground. Murphy approached cautiously. As he gotrncloser, he saw the man's clothes. He knew it was a man, for he knew only onernwho dressed in this fashion, in an old gentleman's dress coat. He saw the hatrnnearby. Only the Darkman dressed this way. He gripped his gun tighter, andrnmoved even closer. It was then that he saw the blood. Smackwater Jack's head hurt a lot. He had been lucky he thought, as he lapsed in and out of consciousness. The Darkman had been thrown off his stride by the gunshots, hadn't been able to strike properly. Jack could barely move as it was. He'drnonly managed to crawl around the corner a couple of minutes before the policernofficer had arrived, and hadn't made it far enough into the shadows of the nextrnalley to avoid a thorough search. One quick look at the officer himself,rnhowever, told Jack that a thorough search was not something to worry about. Thernman was terrified, too terrified to venture further than he had to into therndarkness. Jack smiled with relief. Now hisrnonly concern was to get medical attention before something bad happened to himrnout in the alleyway. He was known here, and was confident that his reputationrnwould provide him safety for a short time, but the longer he was here, injured,rnimmobile, the more dangerous his situation became. People were scared of Jack,rnand he knew that Fear was Power and that Power has always been Law. But now it was time to move. Herngripped his shotgun more tightly. ***** Hospitals were depressing. Then again, thought Dr SallyrnCampion, everywhere was depressing at this time in the morning. She ran a handrnthrough her hair, got up from her desk and headed for the bathroom. She had tornwash her face. It had been an awful night. At least she could go home to bed inrna couple of hours. No more night shifts for a week. This knowledge might haverncheered her up a little if she hadn't seen a police officer running down therncorridor toward her. She sighed. It had to be... \"SergeantrnMurphy. What can I do for you? Have you seen our friend recently?\" \"He'srnhere,\" the man panted. \"He's injured.\" Thisrnstopped Campion in her tracks. The sergeant had been in every couple of daysrnasking questions ever since the Darkman incident. She kept telling him that PeytonrnWestlake (for that is his name, she repeatedly reminded the policeman) was arnseverely unbalanced individual who would probably never show his disfiguredrnface again. Murphy was obviously under therndelusion that Westlake cared for justice. A mistaken impression, Campion knew,rnpatently mistaken. She had thought him a scientist, though. She thought hernwould contact her in that capacity. She had been wrong again. Another dead endrnin her dying career. Westlake and his synthetic skin had been her last chance.rnAnd now, weeks later, he was here? \"What happened?\" \"I was on night patrol, I found him in an alleyway, I heard a gunshot, he's... he's been shot, and I don't know who did it, I didn't look much further, it doesn't pay to be too curious round there, if you know what I'm saying, I just thought...\" Murphy was slowlyrnturning an unhealthy shade of blue in his attempt to detail the situation inrnless than sixty seconds. \"Sergeant, you can stop to take arnbreath if you like.\" \"Yes, but...\" She tried to compose herself.rn\"Don't worry sergeant, I'm on my way now. Where did they put him?\" \"He's in a secure ward, Sally, restrained and under guard. Werndon't want your monsters running around this hospital.\" He said that withoutrnmoving his lips , she thought, until it occurred to her that Murphy probablyrnhadn't learned how to throw his voice, and that the response had actually comernfrom behind her. It was too early in the morning for this rubbish. She turned. \"Dr Simons. Good morning. Wernweren't expecting you for another hour or so.\" She tried to keep the disdainrnfrom her voice. \"Is 'monsters' a medical term now?\" \"Yes, I came in early,\" hernreplied, a raised eyebrow his only acknowledgement of her jibe. I thinkrnsomebody was asking for you down in the secure ward. After all, this thing isrnone of your, er... patients, isn't it?\" \"Yes.\" She brushed past Simonsrnand headed down the corridor. \"And his name is Peyton Westlake!\" she shouted atrnhim. So much for going home. She was going to be here for some time longer. Pain was not an issue for Peyton Westlake. He felt none. Herncould feel broken bones, he could feel burned flesh, he could feel open wounds,rnhe felt all of this in detail in his conscious moments, but he felt no pain. Itrnwas physically impossible for him to feel pain. So he had to concentrate veryrnhard on feeling something else, and it wasn't easy when he was drifting in andrnout of consciousness. If he didn't, he knew that he could break these bandsrnholding him to the bed, and then he'd end up breaking somebody's head, and thatrnwouldn't go down well with hospital security. He was finding it difficult tornstay conscious and focussed. He'd lost too much blood. [lost? no! taken,rnstolen, shot - shot - Yakitito!] and he wanted revenge [ No! I mustrnremain in control, concentrate! ] and he could escape and... Stars exploded behind his eyesrnand all he felt was rage. Then he heard somebody shout his name, a woman [Julie?] ,rnand he sank into the bed once more, the fire behind his eyes quenched by therntears that now welled up. Through the haze of semi-consciousness, he saw arnwoman's face [\"Julie!\"] look over him. He wanted to hide himself away from her. She couldn't see him, herncouldn't allow it; he felt this more strongly and more acutely than everrnbefore. And the sorrow was unbearable. Before hernfell into darkness once again, he considered that he was not completely withoutrnpain. Murphy was worried. He was worried that someone would findrnout that the Darkman was in the hospital. Campion had just shouted his realrnname loud enough for everybody to hear. He would have to mention that to herrnsometime. He was the one who had insisted on a secure ward, allowing onlyrnCampion access to him. He had also removed the man's coat and hat (he had notrnbeen wearing his bandages) before the ambulance team had arrived. The alleywayrnhad actually had a name, though he was surprised that they were willing tornventure down the back streets in the dark. That's a sense of duty alright ,rnhe thought. Murphy knewrnall about duty. It was linked to power He watched Campion attend the Darkman'srnwounds, watched her doing her duty. He himself, well, he'd been doing his dutyrnall night, and now he was here fulfilling it again. They both had power, of onernsort or another, and using one's power properly, well that was duty, wasn't it?rnBut the Darkman himself? He was lying there, shot after a back-street brawl. Hernwas shirking his duty. But Murphy had no power over the Darkman. He couldn'trnforce him to do anything. He would have to accept his duty on his own terms.rnMurphy feared that Peyton Westlake would not live long enough to do that.rnMurphy suspected that, right now, Peyton Westlake would not mind that at all.rnAnd then what hope would there be? What was it he'd said? It sounded like a name, 'Julie'.rnSally Campion filed it away for future information. After all, she was buildingrnup a picture of this man. She could finally add something else to his file.rnThat was reassuring for her, as she extracted the rifle rounds from his body,rnand cleaned the wounds. She liked order. Which was ironic, because she hadrncreated disorder in the mind of Peyton Westlake. Only willpower could keeprnWestlake sane. He was certainly capable of it. It was a question of whether orrnnot he actually wanted to control his urges, his rampant emotions - his anger. It seemedrnto Campion that Westlake wanted to cultivate his anger rather than control it.rnHe would allow it to grow and increase until it consumed his enemies. He wouldrnfind it difficult, she knew. From there, his anger would keep on growing and hernwould not be able to stop it. Then it would consume him also. She sighed as sherndressed the wounds and stepped back to look at the man lying on the bed, at hisrnravaged face. Unblemished skin remained only around his eyes and upper leftrncheek. The rest of his face was horribly scarred. His lips were had all butrnbeen burnt off, and his teeth were all visible. And he would destroy himself,rnshe knew. Despite all his brilliance and genius, he would destroy himself. Andrnhe didn't even realise it. \"Will Irnlive?\" The question took her byrnsurprise. She hadn't expected him to be awake. She collected herself. \"In thernshort term, yes. The wounds aren't infected, and given your powers of recovery,rnyou should be mended in a week.\" \"Excellent. If you would be sornkind as to undo these restraints, I'll be leaving now.\" \"However,\" continued Campion,rngiving no sign that she had heard him, \"in the long term I'd say somebody'srngoing to shoot you again, and if they have any sense they'll shoot you in thernhead and then there'll be nothing I can do for you.\" \"Doctor, please don't lecture me.rnI would remind you that I am a scientist, and perfectly capable of makingrnrational decisions.\" \"No,\" she said, deciding to pushrnher luck, \"you are a freak, you are dangerous, and you are staying here!\" Westlake's face changed in anrninstant. His brows shot down, his mouth curled into a terrifying snarl his eyesrnnarrowed, and a flame was lit behind them. The transformation was frighteningrnin its alarming suddenness. Campion braced herself to run for it. She had gonerntoo far. Then his face relaxed again, andrnhe let out one of his rasping chuckles. \"You will not bait me that easily, DrrnCampion. Now let me out of here. I have work to do.\" She hadn't expected him to dornthat. Perhaps his control had improved more than she gave him credit for. \"Yourrnwork. The synthetic skin.\" \"Yes.\" \"You haven't been back here sincernI helped you last. You haven't told me anything about your progress.\" \"Because there has been nornprogress.\" It was now that she began tornreconsider her last assessment. She looked into his eyes. There was angerrnthere. A great, fiery anger that was barely concealed below the surface. Shernlooked more closely at him. He was tense, very tense, and it belied the calmrnexpression on his face. Well, except for the eyes. Perhaps his control isn'trnso good after all. He's just learning to hide it. From himself as well, Irnthink. \"Fine. So you're just going tornleave now, then? Go back to your warehouse and hide?\" \"Yes. I am. Just as soon as yournrelease me.\" Westlake's impatience was growing, and it showed in his voice. \"Fine.\" She over to him, notrnbreaking eye contact, hoping that she could last out. It wasn't easy to starerndefiantly into those eyes. They were truly terrible. Whatever the expression onrnhis face, she could look straight into his mind through those eyes. For all hisrnefforts, he was unguarded. He had been stripped of more than his ability tornfeel pain. All vestiges of pretence were gone, his civilised mask had beenrnburnt away, and all could see what was underneath it. No wonder he hid behindrnbandages, and covered himself with darkness. He was undefended and unprotectedrnagainst the world. She felt sorry for him. But he still scared her. So she was surprised when hernlooked away from her. She unfastened the restraints and stepped back, but notrntoo far. She wasn't going to cower in his presence not now she had the upperrnhand. \"Thank you, Doctor.\" He stood,rnbut still did not meet her gaze. \"Now, could you please ask the good sergeantrnMurphy to bring me my hat and coat? I would also be grateful if you could findrnme some bandages for my face.\" He looked up suddenly, at the door. \"Ah,rnsergeant Murphy. Do come in.\" Campion looked at the door inrnshock as it opened, and Murphy entered cautiously. He looked like a rabbitrnskewered by the headlight beams of an eighteen-wheeler. \"Well come on man! Whatrnare you waiting for?\" cried Westlake, sounding for all the world like arnderanged Sherlock Holmes. Murphy scurried in, and handed Westlake his clothesrnand a roll of bandage, with an expression close to awe on his face. It wasrnalmost comical. Sally shook herself and tookrncontrol once more. \"Mr Westlake is leaving now, sergeant. I believe you alsornhave duties to return to?\" She looked quickly over at Westlake, and saw his expressionrndarken when she called him by his real name. The cloud past almost as soon asrnit arrived, however, and when he saw her looking at him he averted his gazernonce more. He wrapped the bandage around his head, started to put on his coat,rnand then decided better of it. Coat and hat in hand, he headed for the door. The doctor allowed him to put hisrnhand to the door before saying, \"Someone tried to kill you today.\" Westlakernstopped, frozen. \"Who was it?\" He turned his head toward her andrnmade eye contact again. His eyes were all she could see of his face through thernbandages. There was a hard edge to the anger in them now, an edge that hadn'trnbeen there earlier. He seemed more confident. Something had changed in the lastrnminute. Whatever it was, she was no longer in charge here. \"He was an assassin. A hiredrnkiller. And he won't be the last.\" His growling voice was harder now as well,rnmore determined it seemed. Moments ago he had been almost vulnerable. What hadrnchanged? He opened the door. \"There's a storm coming,\" he said. Then the Darkman was gone. ","Summary":" Darkman:[Chapter 2] 2. Into The Night Some fear the night.

All names, characters and events from the original film are the property of Darkman Productions Ltd; they have been used here without permission. No copyright violation is intended, and no profit has been made from this piece of fan fiction. The first chapter is essentially a summary of the film, and the last few lines are quoted from it. Characters and events in this story not portrayed in the film are original and of my own creation - other authors are welcome to borrow them and incorporate them into their own stories (but please bring 'em back in one piece!). I hope you enjoy this story - if you do, write one of your own! Please note that although this story has been given a PG-13 rating (an accurate and fair rating, I think), the original film (here in England, at least) was rated '18' (the equivalent of the American 'R' or 'NC-17' or whatever you guys call it). For the purposes of this story I have completely ignored the two sequels, both of which, I am assured, are not worth the celluloid they are printed on. The city in which the film was set was never specified - it was a fictional city. I have seen fit to leave it nameless in this sequel. O.M. 9-6-01 Darkman: New Beginnings Before... My name was Peyton Westlake. I was anrnindependent research scientist, and the project I was working on could havernrevolutionised the medical world. Skin grafts. There are thousands of them every year. Many are given tornvictims of accidents and crashes, but many more cannot be done, the injuriesrntoo severe, the techniques imperfect. I was inventing synthetic skin, precise,rncomputer-controlled technology - only a photograph needed to create a perfectrnreplica of a hand, an arm, a foot, or even a whole face. But the cells of thernsynthetic skin were unstable, they never lasted for more than 99 minutes beforernbreaking down and melting. Until the day the light dawned. Inrnfact, it was the day the lights went out. The lights in our lab failed, and thernskin did not break down. Somehow, it was exposure to light for 99 minutes thatrntriggered the collapse of the skin's cell structure. It was a momentous day, arnday I shall never forget. The day my life was destroyed. Robert G. Durant and his hitmen,rnhired by real estate tycoon Louis Strack, filled my lab with gas, and blew itrnup. After shooting Yakitito, my assistant and dear friend, before my helplessrneyes and half-drowning me in a vat of lab solvent, they blew up my lab with mernin it, Strack thinking me a threat to the empire he was, literally, building. I was found in the river, barelyrnalive, and taken to an experimental burns clinic at the hospital. They treatedrnmy injuries, neutralised the parts of my spino-thalamic tract that sent painrnimpulses to my brain. I couldn't feel pain anymore, and my brain compensated byrnrelying more on my emotions for stimulus. My adrenalin flowed unregulated, so Irnhad great physical strength. But I didn't care. All I wanted was my life back,rnand the woman I loved...the woman I love...Julie Hastings. Most of my equipment was destroyedrnin the blast, but I salvaged the essential components, tried to perfect myrnsynthetic skin, but it always melted - only 99 minutes of stability. I foundrnalso that my emotions were now unstable, I was prone to violent outbursts, andrnwith strength enough to do so I killed all those who had ruined my world, butrnstill I told myself that all could be as it was. Night after sleepless night I spent,rntelling myself it was just a burn, skin deep; it doesn't matter! [but my handsrnthey took my hands and my face they took them away[Chapter 2] After... I was sitting in the wreckage of my new home. I trapped members ofrnDurant's gang here and blew them up as they had done to me only a month before.rnAll that was left was the backup material I kept from my experiments. I am arnscientist [not a monster i am not arnmonster ] and I was methodical in my work. I had the money I took fromrnDurant and Strack. I could buy the equipment I need, I have all my programs,rnall the software. But as I looked around I saw only my life, in ruins again.rnLike my face. In ruins, destroyed. I could see it, reflected in a bit of glassrnon the floor. All I could think of was Julie. I grabbed my coat and hat andrnran. Perhaps you think I simply wanted to escape, that I could no longerrnface the woman to whom I had proposed a mere few hours before my disfigurement.rnBut why couldn't I face her? She wanted me back. To my surprise, she had clungrnto me, and I wanted her back so badly. So why did I leave? I told her I couldrnlive with myself, with what I had become. Was I wrong? What had Strack told me?rn\"You can't do it, you couldn't live with yourself.\" There was no fear in hisrneyes, as I held him there, 650 feet above the ground. I've learned to live withrna lot. I can even live with the look on his face as it was overwhelmed byrnterror when I let go. Yes, I could live with it. Was it a desire for justice thatrnmade me do it? He was evil, corrupt. He bribed the Zoning Commission, thernpolice force, had people killed. He was getting his punishment for placing hisrnempire over human life [ my life he destroyed[Chapter 3] [Chapter 4] Later... a flash [my eyes!]. an impact. what? another impact.rnfalling [so this is what it feels like to be shot]. blackness. a face, leaningrnover me, leering [no colours! my eyes!] - blackness [floating in and out ofrnconsciousness]. lifted up [snapshots, like strobe lighting]. a window, open.rnthrown - falling! the ground rushing up [ no! ]. impact Murphy ran from the building, he didn't want to be there,rnhad to get out. His entire life he had served justice, had wanted to protectrnthis city, this city that had killed his parents, had put a young boy into anrnorphanage. And now he finally had the chance, he was working for a police forcernthat put the 'organised' into 'organised crime'. He ran downrnthe steps, half falling, and collapsed against the side of the building at thernentrance to an alley, drawing in great lungfuls of air; he felt sick. Therndarkness surrounded him, and he wondered what on earth he was going to do. Thenrnhe heard a noise, a rasping, dying rattle. He walked further down the alley,rnchecking his sidearm. A bundle of rags on the ground - a person? He bent down,rncould now make out an old-fashioned black coat. \"Help me,\"rnit rasped. Then Murphy saw the hat, and reached down hesitantly to turn therncreature over. He fell back when he saw the face, his legs crumpling beneathrnhim. Bandages were hanging off it, and what was visible was horribly burnt andrnscarred. The hat, the coat, the voice - the Darkman. Still alive?! Murphyrnlooked up. A window was open. Shot and thrown from the window and still alive? Murphyrnsteeled himself and moved back to the man. \"I'm going to get you an ambulance,rnto take you to the hospital.\" He felt a bony hand clutch his trouser leg andrnrecoiled in terror. The Darkman tried to say something, but the grip suddenlyrnwent slack. Unconscious again. Or dead. Murphy had no time to lose. still dark. help me! a figure. blue? [police!rnpolice! no!] ambulance? hospital! [no! they did this to me!] no! I ... darkness light can't see. eyesight clearing [what happened?]. shot!rnsaved? police! I...The hospital. I'm in the hospital. Restrained! What have yourndone to me this time?! What have you done to me?! \"Dr Campion?\" Sally Campion looked up from herrndesk. It was an orderly. She sighed. Now what did they want from her? After thernfailure of her burns project she had become the laughing stock of the hospital.rnProbably she was needed to clean out some old lady's bedpan. \"What is it, Michael?\" \"It's your John Doe, Dr Campion -rnhe's conscious, and trying to demolish his bed.\" What? \"The ward nursernsaid I should fetch you, so...\" \"Woah, woah, time out! Michael,rnwhat John Doe? What are you talking about?\" Michael rolled his eyes, and Sallyrntried not to lamp him - even the orderlies were treating he with contempt. \"One of your old burns clinicrnpatients. You didn't know?\" he said with disdain. \"No, I... From the burns clinic?rnWhere is he?\" The burns clinic! Filled with excitement, Sally followedrnthe orderly. This was it! Her chance to regain her professional standing. Calm,rngirl, calm - be objective, don't indulge false hopes. \"How did they know itrnwas one of mine?\" \"Something about hyper-stimulatedrnadrenal glands, no receptivity to pain, and...\" Michael stopped and pointed at arndoor on the left. \"Well, look for yourself. The patient had to have severalrnbullets removed, he's patched up like an old bicycle tyre, and he's restrainedrn- he tried to attack the staff. The guy that sent for the ambulance is sittingrnin the waiting room just down the corridor. He's a police officer.\" He walkedrnoff. Sally glared at his retreatingrnback. \"Asshole,\" she muttered. She pushed open the door to the room, andrnstepped in. The man in the bed let out a chilling roar when he saw her. \"Who are you?\" he screamed. Shernwas slightly taken aback by this outburst, glad for the restraints - until shernremembered that a clinic patient breaking out of restraints just like thesernones was what had caused her fall from grace. \"I...I'm Doctor Campion, I'm herernto help you. You were one of my patients, do you remember me?\" Sally's spine was crawling - shernhad a bad feeling about this. It was not made any better when the man in thernbed stopped struggling and just looked at her. She returned his gaze. Andrnrealised that it was a mistake. In those tortured eyes she saw pure hatred andrnrage, supernovae exploding. And she was afraid. \" You! You did this to me,rnyou made me a monster!\" he spat, rearing up again, the restraints breaking. Then she recognised him - howrncould she forget? He was the one who had escaped. \"We...I tried to help you,\" shernretaliated indignantly, her fear dissipating in the face of her wounded sensernof professional pride. \"You call this help?\" herncried. \"You've turned me into a freak show ! I'm a monster !\" \"You are not a monster, you justrnhave overactive emotions,\" she pressed him, anger creeping into her voice. Hisrnresponse was a ferocious cry of anger. The something inside Dr SallyrnCampion snapped, all the pent-up emotions of the last couple of monthsrnsurfaced. She was a professional, she was not responsible for creating monstersrnor freaks, she was a doctor, and she helped people. \"No!\" she cried, bounded over to the bed and slappedrnthe patient, open-palmed, full in the face with all her might. He stoppedrnmoving. Before she could turn away, shernsaw that his eyes were fastened on her. The rage was no longer there, except inrnthe contorted expression of fury on her own reflected face. He was raspingrnsomething. Oh no, don't tell me I've injured him, please no, my career wouldrnbe over! It was a second before she realised that he was chuckling. \"I'm sorry,\" she mumbled. \"Don't be. You should havernexpected an extreme reaction, though. What was it you said? Violent mood swings?\"rnHis voice was still confrontational, but she didn't seem to notice. \"Hmm? Oh, when you were in thernclinic first? Yes. I did. I was speaking to the hospital's chief researchrnco-ordinator and his team that day. That was when you escaped wasn't it? Yes.rnThat was the day they shut me down.\" Her eyes had a faraway look in them. Shernsmiled weakly and looked at him. \"No more monsters.\" To her surprise, he looked as ifrnhe was going to cry. Mood swings. Right , she thought wryly. \"Help me.\" His voice was small,rnpleading. She sighed. \"I can't. I want to,rnI really do, but I don't know how to help you.\" She was too weary to care aboutrnthe risk of another violent outburst. But the man said nothing. He just lookedrnat her, helpless, fear rather than anger building up in his eyes. She tried again. \"The only personrnwho can help you right now is...well...you. Have you noticed anything, anything atrnall, that has distracted you from your over-active emotions?\" She expected nornresponse, but his eyes lit up in a way she hadn't seen them do yet. It was thernway one of her colleagues' eyes lit up when they solved some thorny problem. \"Yes! Yes, in an alleyway. It wasrndark, I tried to see better - I was angry - and I could see better, and thernanger faded a bit!\" The words came out in a rush. He was obviously excited, butrnfor what reason? Sally looked at him, puzzled. \"Scientific method!\" hernexclaimed. \"Why should my anger fade because I could see better.\" He paused,rnand looked at her, his eyes shining. \"Let me out of these restraints will you?\"rnShe complied with barely a second thought. \"Now,\" he lowered himself downrnfrom the bed and made his way to the chair in the corner of the room, \"what isrnit about my eyesight that can affect my anger?\" Sally couldn't help but berninfected by his new-found enthusiasm. \"Er...when you see things inrnclearer focus, you're not quite so angry about everything?\" \"No, that's psychological, myrnemotional problem is physiological in basis - because my brain no longer hasrnpain input to process, it heightens my emotional states to extremes torncompensate.\" He suddenly clicked his fingers. \"That's it!\" he turned to her.rnShe shook her head. \"The toothy smile that spread across his face turned hisrnscarred visage into a hideous, grinning skull. She shivered at the contrast. \"No,\" she said, shaking herself,rn\"I don't get it.\" \"My brain requires more stimulusrnto make up for what it's lost. Up to now, we've assumed that that stimulus camernfrom extreme emotional reactions. But why couldn't it come from any otherrnsource? All of my senses provide input to my brain, so any one of them couldrncompensate!\" Campion was getting excited nowrntoo. \"So by heightening all your other senses, your brain wouldn't draw sornheavily on your emotions! You'd have better control of yourself, and increasedrnsensory acuity.\" She tried to keep hold of her scientific objectivity, butrnfound it difficult. This could be her chance to get her burns clinicrnre-instated. \"You'll have to work at it, though. Your default setting is wildlyrnuncontrollable emotion, so to you'll have to consciously override that like yourndid in the alley. If your concentration ever slips...\" Neither of them needed to finishrnthe sentence. \"You need to work on it,\" she said \"You can't go anywhere for arnwhile, and you need to take it very easy while you recover. There are multiplerngunshot wounds that need time to heal. Do you need anything?\" \"He looked up at her. Myrnequipment. I'm a scientist, I was working on a project. Most of my equipmentrnhas been destroyed, there are a couple of disk drives in an old warehouse downrnat the abandoned industrial plant. I can also tell you where I hid enough moneyrnto buy the necessary hardware. You...\" \"Hold on, hold on, what's thisrnproject you were working on?\" He looked up at her as if itrnshould be obvious. \"Synthetic skin. Ironic, yes? I was in my lab when...\" hernstopped himself, clearly trying to avoid another outburst. She nodded,rnunderstandingly, she hoped. \"Alright - wait - syntheticrnskin?\" The burns clinic! was all she could think. \"You can creaternsynthetic skin? Then why didn't you...\" she gestured at his face. He grunted. \"Why didn't I make myself a face?rnThe skin isn't stable. After 99 minutes exposure to light the cells break down,rnand the skin melts. I'm...I was working on a way to fix it.\" Her face fell. \"You have no idearnhow much that would have helped my work.\" She immediately regretted saying it. \"Yes I do,\" he rasped. \"But itrncan still work, I know it can. If you help me, you'll get your burns clinicrnback.\" Murphy sat in the waiting room, thinking. This creature,rnthis Darkman, if he recovered he had the power to rid the city of therncorruption he had discovered. The police officer looked at his watch. It hadrnbeen nearly 18 hours since he had brought the Darkman into the hospital. He hadrngone home, unable to sleep, and called in sick at the PD. He had just sat inrnthe waiting room all day. A woman doctor had entered the room a few minutesrnago; he had been watching the door of the room he knew they had taken thernDarkman to. All he knew was what a nurse had told him, \"Your friend's conditionrnis stable,\" she had said. He hadn'trnhad the heart to tell her that the Darkman was not his friend, and that hernsuspected that the man's condition was far from stable. But he had the power,rnthis dark figure, to change the things. Forcibly if necessary, but he couldrnchange them. Perhaps he didn't know it, perhaps he just wanted revenge onrnBellisarius. Murphy didn't understand revenge. Bellisarius had sold out to thernbad guys, and Murphy wanted to see him pay, he must be punished: Bellisariusrnhad committed a crime after all. But Murphy didn't want revenge. He simplyrnwanted justice. He stood up. The doctor had left. Hope had entered his heart, for thernfirst time in too long. He was angry still, very angry, but he could wait. Hernwould bide his time, build up his lab again, maybe even help this doctor, andrnthen take his revenge on the 'law'. His reverie was broken by the door opening.rnBefore him stood a figure dressed in blue. The figure started to speak, but herndidn't hear the words. Before him stood the law, but he didn't see it. He sawrnJulie. Everything that he had lost, because of the 'law'. His world contractedrndown to that single face. Everything else went black. The roar ofrnpain, rage and despair that he let out was heard down the hall. So was thernsound of the impact against the door. Murphy walked into the Darkman's hospital room. The man wasrnsitting in the corner of the room; Murphy couldn't see his deformed face.rnProbably a good thing, since his confidence was draining slowly away. Betterrnget it said, then. \"You have to help me, help this city, because you can dornthat, you can get justice done, you...\" the words came out in a rush, but stoppedrnwhen the Darkman rose, his eyes flashing dangerously, his expression one of fury.rnMurphy backed away, the expression of fear on his face turning to terror whenrnthe Darkman let out a bellow of rage. Murphyrnturned and fumbled the door handle, but his attacker was faster than he looked,rnand was across the room in a moment. He slammed into the policeman and the doorrnat the same time, but then drew in a rasping, gasping breath and fell back,rnclutching his chest. Blood was soaking his hospital-issue shirt; he couldn'trnbreathe. Murphy turned around again and just stood gaping. He could hear thernDarkman say something, but by the time he had bent down to listen, the man wasrnunconscious. BeforernMurphy raced out of the room to get an orderly, or a nurse, or someone ,rnhis brain had enough time to register that it had sounded like the Darkman was repeatingrnthe name 'Julie'. blackness replaced by light blurred blue grey [can'trnmove!] and \"Good afternoon. How do you feel?\" The Darkman opened his eyesrnfully, blinked once and fastened his eyes on the man in the police uniformrnsitting on the chair on the other side of the room. \"I attacked you.\" Arnstatement of fact. \"Yes, yourndid. You managed to re-open a couple of the bullet wounds as well.\" Murphy wasrnuneasy still. The Darkman had adjusted too easily to the light, too quickly. Hernremembered what the doctor had said, that the Darkman had the ability tornconsciously sharpen all his senses. He shivered. \"Ah. Well,rnit seems I am restrained, so I don't think I'll be attacking anyone for arnwhile. Who are you and what do you want?\" \"My name isrnTodd Murphy, and I want you to help me change this city.\" The Darkmanrnwas silent for a moment, and then started wheezing hideously. Murphy was atrnfirst taken aback; then realised that the other man was laughing. \"You...want me ...tornbecome a crime fighter?\" Murphy feltrnhis face going red. \"Yes, because you can,\" he replied, offended and a littlernangry at being mocked. \"I overheard your little confrontation with Bellisarius,rnand you have to stop him. Maybe that's why I brought you here in the firstrnplace.\" The Darkmanrnstopped laughing. \"You saved my life, then? Thank you. But perhaps it wouldrnhave better if you hadn't.\" He closed his eyes (was that a tear?) and restedrnhis head back against the pillow. His fists were balled, but he wasn'trnstraining against the restraints. Murphy took this as a good sign. Still, thernpolice officer felt nervous when the Darkman looked back up. There was no angerrnin his eyes, but there was...something else, something cold. \"Veryrnwell,\" was all he said. Encouraged,rnMurphy began again. \"You can work on increasing the effectiveness of yourrnsenses - the doctor told me all about it! - and then you'll be better, yourrnemotions won't be as much of a problem. You'll need to train hard though.\" PeytonrnWestlake shook his head, wondering at the sudden boyish enthusiasm of the man,rnlike this was some kind of childhood dream for him. Maybe it was. My lab, Irnmust have my lab back! he thought. He would move it to another part of thernindustrial plant as well, somewhere Julie couldn't find him. He had to tell thatrndoctor what to get for him. And this police officer, he could be useful. Therernwas a lot to do.[Chapter 5] New Beginnings. The Darkman lay in his hospital bed, healing. The doctor,rnCampion, visited him often, and the police officer occasionally stopped by asrnwell. He felt no pain, but found that if he concentrated hard, he could sensernwhere he was injured. Once, he thought he could even feel the wounds close,rncould feel the new cells grow. It didn't last long, and he had to practicallyrnstopped breathing. He did, however, feel calmer than he had since...before. Hisrnability to improve his vision, hearing, and sense of smell got better everyrnday. And his revenge would be that much sweeter and swifter for it. Let Murphyrnthink his intention was to fight crime in the city. It didn't matter. Nothingrnelse did. Todd Murphy returned to his work, but found he could notrnconcentrate. He desperately wanted to help this Darkman, but knew that it wasrnreally only so that he could see justice done. Well, mostly. There was still arnlittle apprehension though; and he had not plucked up the courage to ask whorn'Julie' was. He started hatching plans, ways to expose his chief, but knew thatrnthey needed hard evidence, evidence of all the various pies in whichrnBellisarius had his fingers buried. An idea was forming in his mind, as hernremembered the first night he had met the Darkman, and what he had been toldrnabout that night by the Darkman himself. But he would need the Darkman's helprnif it was to work. So Murphy waited. Sally Campion went around in a state of perpetualrnexcitement. She had found the Darkman's stash easily, and had bought all thernequipment he had asked for. As per instructions, she had set it all up inrnanother part of the industrial plant - underground, below the warehouse that hadrnbeen the lab's home until the Darkman had blown it up himself. She understoodrnsome of the technology, marvelled at the innovative techniques, but admitted tornherself that only the 'Darkman' ( What was his real name? she oftenrnwondered) knew how it really worked. And it could make all her work, her life'srnpursuit, viable and even better. Not only did she have the chance to study arnpatient of her old clinic at close range - she knew of his plans to become arncrime-fighter, thanks to the irrepressible Todd Murphy - she also had the addedrnbonus of the possibility of synthetic skin. The stage was set. \"I'm ready to leave, aren't I?\" Thernquestion caught her by surprise. \"That's what you came to tell me, yes?\" Shernnodded. \"Yes. Howrndid you know?\" \"I can feelrnit. I know my wounds have healed. How long has it been? That I'm not sure of.\" \"Just underrnthree weeks. Your powers of recuperation are astounding. Conscious effort?\" Shernknew what the answer would be, but wasn't quite sure she could believe it. Allrnthis with the power of a mind deprived of pain? Theoretically thern'everything-else-as-a-mental-substitute' idea was interesting and possible, butrnit wasn't scientifically quantifiable. And pain was useful, every biologistrnknew that. So where were the drawbacks? There had to be some, there... \"Yes. I canrndo more than I imagined would be possible. Not bad for a freak.\" Campion never knew when he wasrnbeing serious, when he was mocking himself, or when he would fly into a rage. Irnguess the state of his mental health could be put down as a drawback , shernthought wryly to herself. Out loud she said, \"You should go. Murphy isrnwaiting.\" His head snapped up. \"Murphy?rnWhat does he want?\" \"He has an idea for your firstrnact as the newest crime fighter in the city,\" she said, amused. \"You know about that?\" She nodded again. \"If you needrnany help...\" He inclined his head toward her,rnand walked past her and out of the room. She stood, slightly surprised at thernsuddenness of his departure. She shook her head and smiled. This was going tornbe interesting. And unpredictable. It was a dark night. No light shined through the thickrnlayers of cloud over the city. But Peyton Westlake could see just fine. He wasrnthe Darkman. He moved silently through the back alleys, searching for the one thatrnhe had visited that night, three weeks ago. He found it. And his target wasrnstanding outside, alone. Foolish. He smiled grimly and made his way down thernalley, creeping up behind his victim. \"Remember me?\" he whispered. Jennyrnturned, saw - no, it couldn't be - \" You !\" She had no time to react as herngrabbed her, placed his hand over her mouth, and wrapped his free arm aroundrnher, pinning her arms to her side. He physically lifted her and carried herrninto the shadows. \"Yes, me.rnAnd if you make a move for the knife I know you have concealed away, I'll breakrnyour neck. I just came to give you a message: it's over. Bellisarius' littlernsecret - well, one of them - is out of the bag. Namely, you. The fool keptrnbusiness records of all his dealings with you.\" Jennyrnmentally cursed Bellisarius, for screwing up that and for not finishing thisrncreature off permanently. She tried to speak, and the Darkman removed his handrnfrom her mouth, warning her to be quiet. \"He willrnhunt you down and he will kill you!\" she spat. \"He runs this city, and he runsrnits muscle. He doesn't always go out in the middle of the night to beat uprnprostitutes himself. You don't stand a chance, you're just a man in a big coat,rnan old hat, and some head bandages!\" Westlakernspun her around to face him, his eyes narrowed, gleaming. \"I am the Darkman!\"rnhe exclaimed. He whipped his coat up in front of her face and she threw herrnhands in front of her eyes, a reflex reaction. When sherncould see again, the Darkman had vanished. Bellisarius was in his office the next day when the callrncame. \"Bellisarius,\" he said, answering it. It was Jenny. \"You fool, what arernyou doing calling me here?\" he hissed at her. \"I'm arnfool, am I? Well, I'm not the one who thought it'd be a good idea to not onlyrnkeep a record of my illegal dealings and racketeering, but also to leave themrnlying around for some freak with a severe skin condition to find!\" \"Jenny,rnwhat the hell are you talking about? Nobody knows about my dealings with yournand your little whorehouse, and I certainly don't keep records of...skinrncondition? That damnable Darkman's back?!\" \"Yes, yourncouldn't even kill him could you? No wonder you couldn't keep your records fromrnhim!\" \"I don'trnkeep any records, woman! I'm not that stupid. I know exactly what you owe me.\"rnHe paused. \"Wait a minute - he told you this? What did he say?\" A sinkingrnfeeling descended on the police chief. \"He saidrnthat it was over, that he had your private records, or something.\" \"Did he sayrnwhere he'd gotten them?\" \"No! Andrnyou just said you didn't keep any!\" \"I don't,\"rnBellisarius said thoughtfully. Then his voice took on a tone of finality.rn\"Maybe he was just trying to scare you. Get off this line and don't call mernhere again. I'll contact you shortly for your next payment toward yourrnprotection.\" He slammed the phone down hard enough to knock the it off therndesk. He cursed, and bent to pick it up. That was when he noticed the smallrnpiece of metal attached to the bottom of it. A police-issue phone-tappingrndevice. The bit of paper stuck next to it read, ' I heard you. And I'm notrngoing to go away. DM. ' Darkman! Murphy, whornwas walking past the door to the police chief's office, heard Bellisarius' cryrnof fury, and smiled with satisfaction. It was evening, and the sun had set when Murphy and Campionrnarrived at the agreed meeting place. The sky was a deep, dark blue, nearlyrnblack, and there was very little light - only a sliver of moonlight shonernthrough the clouds. The shadows were deep; this was not a good time to be onrnthe streets in this part of the city. The dirty buildings loomed up around thernpair. \"Maybe hernisn't coming after all,\" said Campion, shivering at the cold. \"No, he'llrnbe here. I know it,\" Murphy assured her, and looked around. He jumped back asrnWestlake melted out of the shadows. \"Here. Takernit, he growled from under the brim of his hat. His coat was wrapped tightlyrnaround him, the bottom flapping in the breeze. He held out a hand with arncassette tape in. \"Your little gadget worked.\" Murphy grinned. \"That'srngreat!\" \"Why is shernhere?\" The dark figure nodded at Campion. The doctor stepped forward. \"I wantedrnto see how you were doing.\" \"I'm fine,\"rnwas the reply, although it was clear from his tone that he was not fine in thernleast. Murphy,rnoblivious, was still bubbling. \"This is great! We've started bringing justicernto this city...\" he broke off, unsure what to call him. \"Er...what should I callrnyou?\" Murphy felt uncomfortablernaddressing this man; he seemed indifferent, even annoyed with their success. The figurernlooked up slightly, and Murphy could see two eyes, narrow and yellow,rnunderneath the brim of the hat. The rest of the face was in shadow, but herncould see the corner of a malformed mouth, bare, lipless teeth glinted arnlittle, the skin around them charred. When the words came, the voice was hard,rncold, guttural, and so vicious that Murphy physically stepped back. \"My namernwas Peyton Westlake. But you can call me Darkman. And I know nothing ofrnjustice. That word is yours, not mine. Deceive yourself all you wish, but Irnwill not -xa0 I call it what it is:rnrevenge. And I will have mine. I will have my revenge!\" With that,rnthe Darkman spun on his heel. He stalked off into the night, and the darknessrnswallowed him.

Peyton Westlake thought as he reminisce the development of the pastnmonths. It as been nearly half a year since that incident and yet henwonders if he would feel being appreciated and cared for again. It was thenonly time that he felt that he mattered and did something special, not tonmention being accepted after the event that forced him to become Darkman. He was nowhere near in completing his work than before, although henwas able to move on a new level on his skin, he wasn't able to complete it.nIf in the past he's synthetic skin was able to hold up after 99 min. and 99nseconds now the skin can hold up in 3 hours giving him more time to prowlnthe streets and keep an eye on danger. And speaking of danger, Peyt was broken from his reverie when hisnalarm censors sounded \"INTRUDER ALERT\". He looks at his monitor screen andnsaw an intruder leaning on the walls for support before dropping on thenground. From the angle his watching he can't tell for sure if it's a girlnor a man or even if it's a trapped to lure him out from his hiding placenlike before. But the doctor inside him is still strong and the call to healnis urging him to see if the intruder is indeed hurt. With a grunt he strode to the door and into the intruder. When he wasnon his way to the intruder he noticed the blood painted on the walls,ndefinitely that wasn't there before, it seems that the intruder is indeednhurt. But he was not sure if the who it was and how did he arrive on hisnplace, he wondered if there are people waiting for him to show ready tonjumped on him but from his enhanced senses the only thing in the tunnelnwith him is the faint stirrings coming from the injured person before him. Once that Peyt was sure that nobody is there ready to jumped at himnonce he showed up, he kneeled and examine the person, when he reached outnhe can tell that the person was bleeding badly and that there is already annamount of blood had been lost. He turned the intruder to see on what isnthe extent of his injuries. After he turned the person he was shocked atnwhat he saw. \"It's a woman.\" To be continued…[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't own Darkman… Somebody else does. Chapter 2 Peyton carried the bleeding body of the woman into his lab. At thensame time wondering on how on earth did a woman got into his tunnel andnwhy. He found only a nametag on her, and the name it said was Kathleen Hal,nand to his great surprise another doctor like him, although it doesn'tnexactly say on what field of medicine she's been specializing on. Once he arrived on the lab, he quickly lay Kathleen down and startednadministrating on her injuries. He tore her shirt out and studied theninjury, the bleeding was caused by a bullet wound on the stomach that isnthe only major wound she's got, after he got the bullet out of her body, henstarted stitching it and then focused on the other light wounds. Apparentlynshe must've hit her head on something cause there's wound there, and annasty flesh wound on her shoulder too. His protectiveness is surfacingnalthough he doesn't know why, he's a doctor and helping people in need isnwhat he does but the caring one in him died long ago, or so he keepsntelling himself. It seems whoever she was; she was running away from someone with angun who wants her dead. He almost laughs at the notion that there is angroup out there who wants doctors dead because in the past someone did trynto kill him. When he started to clean her up, he noticed how beautiful she was,nwith the silky raven hair, from her angelic features, asleep she almostnlooks like an innocent child, from her small nose, to her sensual lips. Shenhas soft curves and her smooth almost translucent skin in color, althoughnbluish at the time because of the bruises she received. He's protectivenessnis growing more intense by the minute and it is turning into anger atnwhoever harmed this woman before him. He's emotion's was starting to act upnagain, he can't help to have another one of his hallucinations when hisntreating his patient, he might do something to harm her. It's a good thingnthat he has been improving in reining his mood swings; otherwise he mightndo something he'll regret later, like kissing this woman before her. Nownwhere the hell did that though came from! Instead of thinking about itnPeyton just focused on fixing his patient up. He was almost finish in cleaning her up, when she stirred and moaned fromnthe pain she's feeling, very briefly she opened her eyes and he wasnstartled to see hazy blue eyes looking at him, for a moment he considerednif he should asked her who she really was instead of how she is feeling atnthe moment. But before he could utter a word, her lids closed again andnfell into a deep sleep. \"You have been underground way too long, Peyton.\" Peyton said shakingnhis head to himself. That girl is dangerous to him. Peyt thought to himself. She might bensent to infiltrate him and still his life's work or something but he reallyndoesn't know for sure and he doesn't want to care and be involve, the thingnis once he helped her and took her to his lab, he is already involve. Whatnto do, the only thing to do is to send her back wherever is that. Oncenshe's okay he's going to bring her up to the surface, away from his worknand from his emotions. Because this girl before him is getting to the wallnhe erected around his emotions, he never felt like this before not evennwith Julie, and he knows that he still loves her even though he knew thatnthey couldn't be together. The worst part is that Kathleen wasn't evennconscious at the moment but she can already bring out his protective sidenand wake up the man he once been, the one who died when they took his wholenlife from him, because to him he's no longer Peyton Westlake but thenDarkman. To be continued…[Chapter 3] 1.1 DISCLAIMER: I don't own Darkman… Somebody else does… 2 Chapter 3 Peyton was watching T.V and was disgusted at the news. It's about ancertain millionaire who was being investigated of murder and corruption. Itnis said that the millionaire had an accident and was not seen in publicnsince. What a miserable guy, Peyton though to himself why doesn't he justnuse his money to fix himself up, if he were in his position, he would donjust exactly that, if only he had the means then he won't be suffering herenin a tunnel with rats and pest to be his company. Well for the moment henhas a beautiful unconscious guest. Peyton frowned. Disgusted with himselfnfor allowing such thoughts to enter his mind, he continued with hisnexperiments without waking his female guest. ***** \"Mikey, Mikey would you please calm down.\" Multi millionaire DanielnScott told his brother who is currently in a hostile mood, since the newsnon T.V. about his accident and the murder charge he went ballistic, fromncursing to throwing things around the place. \"How could I calm down, I have a murder case against me not tonmention that blasted news about my accident! How the hell did that comenout? If I found out who leaked the information whoever he is will wish henwasn't even born!\" Michael said while shooting the ceiling to mark hisnpoint. \"If the media is watching the estate right now, and saw you rampagingnlike a caged animal instead of a educated person that you are, you'renalready ruined reputation is going to be ruined some more.\" \"How could you stay calm, after what happened?\" \"If I turn into a maniac like you, who would take care of thenproblems we are currently facing right now, huh, little brother.\" \"It's you're fault why we are having problems right now.\" \"If you are talking about Kathleen's escape, that wasn't entirely mynfault, you have your men shooting down at her, if I didn't interfere theynwould have killed her, and by the looks of things I think she is alreadyndead.\" \"…\" \"Don't forget, you're entire healing is on her hands, since doctornPeyton Westlake died, she's the next best thing to solving you're problem.\"n\"I can see that you are tired… why don't you rest and I'll handle thisnthing.\" Daniel said taking in the exhausted look of his brother. \"Okay, I'll go to my room, sorry about this brother, I just don'tnlike my accident being talked about.\" \"It's okay, I'll find out who leaked the info. Stop worrying about itngo to rest.\" Daniel watched as his younger brother leave, since the accident thenwhole house was covered with darkness. And as Michael go to his room anstray of light caught his features. Daniel felt sorry for him every time henremember that faithful day that chanced the life of his only living familynleft. Daniel closed his eyes and allowed the bitter memory creep inside hisnmind. Exactly over a year ago, he and Michael was visiting the laboratorynthat produced the chemicals they used to built microchips and weapons withntheir clients. The container that Mike was looking at was hit with a straynbullet from his own gun when he killed one of their clients who are doublencrossing them. The container exploded unable to hold the chemicals. Michael had nontime to run and the chemical swallowed him whole. He could still remembernhis brother's fevered screams of help while the chemical burned his skinnaway and exposing the muscles hid underneath. Michael's left arm wasncompletely burned away and was now replaced with a mechanical one. Now anhideous monster replaced Michael's blond playboy look. Until now, Daniel still feels guilty for what happened, but Michaelnnever blamed him for everything, he promised himself that he's going to doneverything he can to bring normalcy back to Michael's life. No matter what it take's. To be Continued…[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own Darkman, somebody else does. Chapter 4 Pain. Kathleen woke up with an aching body, her muscles felt laden with lead, and she got a blinding headache. And when she tried to sit up she felt like she was being hit by lightning, jolts of pain shot throughout her entire being. With a moan she finally settled back into her bed. She tried to remember what happened, and more importantly where she is now. This place doesn't look like a hospital, but looking through the wounds that she can actually see, she was properly taken care off, and the neatness in the dressing of her wounds tells her that a doctor patched her up. She closed her eyes and tried to remember what exactly happened to her, and how she got in this place. With a sickening thud, it all came flooding back to her. She remembered working for the Scott's as a doctor inventing a skin that would help the younger brother to recover from his hideous state. In the Scott residence she got everything she needed, from the state of the art equipments to the experienced people she needed to help her in her research. Although she has everything a scientist could ever ask for, she wasn't allowed to wonder the mansion, she is to stay in her lab and do her work, if she wishes to go out, she would have to tell one of the guards to accompany her, she is never to ask a question on the happenings in her surroundings, all she has to was her job. Being a spit fire and a curious person as she would mildly put herself to, she always asked questions she is forbidden to ask. She always suspected that the Scott's are doing something illegal, she loathed to work for them, but the opportunity to be able to complete her research and project with the generous help from them is very tempting. So at night she would prowl the mansion, hiding at every corner when somebody walks in, she just wanted to know the people she is working for, as she would always tell herself when the idea of being caught is getting to her. Once when she was caught, Daniel the older brother, patted her cheek and coldly stared at her while reminding her the reason for her stay. And telling her in a not so subtle way that if she found out something, anything at all, she would find herself in the streets or worse...being the stubborn lady she is, she retorted that they could never find another one like her, nor find another soul who can find a way to make a synthetic skin that could help his little brother. Daniel only laughed at her which made her more furious, she is not a prisoner damn it!. Daniel grabbed her hard and kissed her square in the lips, she pushed him away and delivered a rather hard slap and stalk out the room. She knew many women would want to be kissed by the dashingly handsome Daniel, with her blond playboy look, and cool baby blue eyes of his, many ladies are swooning all over him with just a single smile. But for her, she finds him cold and calculating, always on the look out, not to mention in her opinion a bastard who deserve nothing better, and only a demented person would fall for him. Then she remembered that particular event that causes her to leave that place. She was on her nightly prowl when she heard an argument coming from the end of the hallway. Daniel was having an argument with one of his \"clients\", the argument was heating up, then suddenly Michael got fed up and started shooting at the unsuspecting man, even Daniel seemed shocked. Daniel ordered him to stop but Michael wouldn't listen, he kept firing like some demon from hell has taken possession of his body. The wild look on Michael's eyes as he kept firing his gun, was a something she would never forget. Even Michael's burned features is nothing compare to the horror that she witnessed that night. Being a burned specialist she was accustomed to the sight of burned people, some of them was unrecognisable, and yet those are nothing compared to what she saw. She tried to escape and was found, they started shooting at her, she remembered what it felt like when the bullet entered her body, she decided there and there she would never in her life get shot again, the pain she felt was so intense she though she was going to faint, but her determination to escape gave her the strength to continue. She hid in the darkness, then when she was certain that they were gone, she continued on... she already lost a lot of blood, and she was already staggering. She found a small whole in a wall that she used to hide her work she manage to take with her, she would not let those people get something she spent almost her whole life on. She remembered walking on some more when she fell into some sort of a tunnel and hit her head. She used the walls for support, but the pain and blood lost is really getting to her, the last thing she remembered was a alarm system going on when she passed out, then after sometime she could swore she just saw a pair of two hazel brown eyes that seemed to stare right through her soul. That pair of eyes is the only thing that she used to cling to when she was haunted by dreams, those plus a deep baritone voice that is telling her everything is going to be alright. And now that she is awake, she still hadn't have a clue where she is or who saved her. She tried to sit up to look around and see if she could get a clue on where she is, but her body kept protesting and pain shot through her ones again, so with a grunt she fell back to bed and let the darkness and the peace of sleep get her ones more. TO BE CONTINUED...[Chapter 5] Darkness' Salvationn Chapter Five He was by something but his fogged mind was not helping him focus,nhis thought was still in the dream that has resided in his subconsciousnsince the incident, and yet there was something different. but the dream isnalready fading as his mind starts to function properly then the cause fornhis to awaken made itself known. His guest for the past week seems to be trashing in her sleepnprobably because of a nightmare. She has proven herself strong. In the daysnwhen her body is burning from fever and infections, she struggled andnfought for her life, and now that the danger had passed her body onlynneeded rest to recover, everyday she's getting better, her color isnreturning, and she seems to get more beautiful as the day goes by!!! Peyton stop that particular train of though as he search hisnscientific mind on how that particular though came for the hundredth timensince he helped the woman. And for the hundredth time he told himself thatnit's just an admiration for her strength, that combined with the fact itsngood to take care of someone, it has been a long time since he felt like anreal doctor again. Of course there's also the reason that his patient is anfellow doctor but a beautiful one as well. \"Damn.\" Peyton said. *** The dream is already fading and with it came a voice, a softlynaccented voice soothing her that she found oddly comforting, she was ablento relax gradually she was able to focus and open her eyes. To say Kathleen was surprised to see a handsome man with hazel eyesngazing at her was a vast understatement. All her life she wanted to meet the man whose vast knowledge innsurgery, burns and synthetic skin had inspired in taking this career, butnbefore she met him, he was killed in an accident in his lab. at least thatnwas what the news said. But now the man of her dreams is standing over her with the warmestngaze and the softly accented voice asking her if she were all right. Shenvaguely wondered if she was still dreaming. Peyton was getting uncomfortable with the way his patient is staringnat him. And she is still yet to respond to his inquiries, maybe shensuffered a head trauma, sometimes there is no knowing that until thenpatient's regain consciousness or. \"Dr. Peyton Westlake.\" Kathleen finally whispered. He stared at her a momentary panic settled into his beautiful eyes,nbefore the shutter came and just a neutral expression adorned his face. How can this woman know who I possibly 'am. Was she a spy? 'No.' Peyton though to himself, he could see real confusion and awe in herneyes. such an expressive eyes. her midnight blue eyes should be able tonhide her emotions but instead it's open like an open book that makes herneasy to read. \"How. the news, s-said that you died in the accident at you lab. How can.\"nKathleen asked. \"Please, calm down you suffered a very serious wound.\" \"Wounds?\" \"Don't you remember anything that happened to you\" Peyton asked. \"Um. yes the gun shots, I-I was shot.\" \"Good, I manage to pull out the bullet in your stomach and that wasnyour major injury, although there are bruises sporting you body as well.\" \"I understand. By the way I'm Dr. Kathleen Hal, burns specialist\"nKathleen said by the way of a introductions. She saw how that statementntook him aback, but then he quickly overcame it. \"Good, you're a doctor. Then you know the drill about your case,nplease try to take some rest, I will see you again later.\" Giving a smallnsmile, he left. Kathleen noticed that he didn't introduced himself to verify whethernor not he is who she though he is. But the shock of seeing that man and thenexhaustion of talking even for a short time, testimony how weak she stillnis, she fell asleep thinking of hazel eyes and soothing voice. *** Trying to ease his troubled mind Peyton walked through the darkenednstreets of the city, extending his senses for trouble with inhumanncapacity. Through the years he had learned how to use his senses in a waynno normal could ever do, in this way he could usually eased his troublednthoughts. With the implant last year which proved to be fatal produced anmiraculous result, he can now feel through his skin although only a littlenbut each day through extensive practice and patience, it's growing. He could now feel the breeze as it passes by but not the coldness itnbrings, or the warmth of the sun, it has been ages since he felt thosenlittle things that became important to him now. But now, nothing seems to work in easing his mind with the chaoticnthoughts racing in his brain. Thoughts of midnight blue eyes. His thoughts were interrupted when he picked up a heated discussion,nthrough one if the abandoned buildings in the area. He was about to interfere when he caught what they are saying. \". damn it!, Where could that girl be!?\" said a male voice. \" This is all your fault! We wouldn't lose her if it wasn't for yournstupidity, now the boss is really pissed.\" Answered by an accented voice. \"Don't worry the Hal doctor was shot, she wouldn't last long. atnleast long enough to talk. let's get out here.\" \"Yeah, this place gives me the creeps, what kind of low life couldnactually live here anyway.\" By the time Peyton arrive at the scene the men where already gone. 'So they're looking for his beautiful patient.' Peyton thoughtngrimly.

sabida sino planeada muerte de jack harper 44 ella había llamado a su hija jacqueline o jackie, volaba de regreso de el puesto de vigilancia y mantenimiento 35 con vika 35 haciéndole la clase introductoria de lo que era y como había quedado el planeta y los recursos y planes que había mientras volaba el vehículo aéreo a través del cañón; julia y jack 46 se habían sorprendido, sin beech los sobrevivientes eran mucho mas precavidos o paranoicos, todos sus puestos o puntos estaban vedados para jacks o vikas y su tecnología, así que julia y jacqueline vivían en la cabaña con un vehiculo volador y escaladores le vigilaban y a los otros desde lejos, julia escalaba a veces, buscaba arroyos, de grietas, de lluvia; y vieron las dos el lago, la cabaña y a vika 46 que caminaba y nadaba en este, vika 35 dice \"bueno, alguien tiene mi tipo de cabello y \", se fija mejor, julia piensa *¿ajustando los opticos vika?, todavía ajusta o trata jack de ajustar los aparatos o maquinas vigilantes*, vika 35 voltea a mirar a julia diciendo \"¿soy yo?, ¿que puesto?\", julia le contesta \"ese es un dato protestado, la tecnología y datos de los puestos y torres son de los jacks, las vikas y mías, pero en nuestro conjunto, todos los sobrevivientes liberamos agua de una deposito en un sitio profundo no permeable y plantamos peces y plantas de mar, van a pasar mas meses, otros años pero no van a salinas después, creemos que durarán\", y vika dice \"esperemos, quizás\". julia rusakova y la vika 35 están observando los costados del cañón del arrollo-rio y a los vigilantes de los sobrevivientes terráqueos y julia le explica \"en realidad ellos están en la altura o profundidad de el terreno como estaba antes de los desastres naturales y la guerra, aparte del polvo lunar que todavía cae y cambia nuestra atmósfera y nos creemos que el proceso que nos permitió este lugar es la erosión de tierras no bien fijas\", vika observa y dice \"yo nado en mi puesto\" duda un poco \"donde vivo o vivía\" , julia le abraza con un brazo diciendo \"y no hay problema, los materiales son superduros y perduraran\", julia observa hacia arriba \"y los lugares donde están parecieran geologicamente estudiados\", vika se pregunta pensando *y ¿la energía y el agua?, uffff, si este fue un gran paso y difícil para mi*. julia estaba adormilada en un sarape que le habían dado los mundanos y una de las vikas estaba diciéndole a otra vika \"... en nuestro puesto yo empece a tener sueños, un poco irreales\" la vika que esta hablando voltea a ver a julia y la otra vika le voltea a ver, ella como para asegurarse o seguirle la corriente a la otra, la vika continuo \"pero que había olvidado y que ahora recuerdo por lo que me dijo julia rusakova de el rio que erosionaba las paredes de los récodos formando el cañón\", la vika que estaba escuchando se agacha y dice \"¿y me lo estas contando por ...?\" y sonrió, la otra vika se sonrojo un poco y dice \"te contare, y veremos, estoy en un barco de tipo bote pero barco por varios asientos y una lona de techo y veo a una joven rubia que esta viendo el, creo, rio, y después me siento o veo preguntando por algo, y veo un lago o rio

mano derecha se puso el dedo indice en los labios. julia y una vika, una de las otras vikas ya que julia había visitado el 44 con nostalgía y había visto con sus propios ojos los restos de una pequeña batalla, una maquina centinela contra los ocupantes humanos del puesto y a la vika de el puesto muerta, la habían enterrado tan cerca de la base de la torre como los cimientos de supermaterial lo permitieron, una de esas veces en que le había acompañado alguien a esas torres y que había ocultado su asombro, viajaban hacia la torre a verificar si funcionaban los aparatos y, si el agua estaba aún limpia, y la vika dice \"se que por algún proceso eres joven, tan joven como nosotras y los jacks\" la vika voltea a ver a julia y continúa \"¿cómo era el pasado?, ¿como era jack en el pasado?\", julia se tarda un poco y dice \"gente, grupos de humanos\", julia señala la tierra desolada con la cabeza, continúa \"multitudes de humanos, grandes paises con grandes diferencias, de gustos, de vestir\", julia sonríe, dice \"te tengo que mostrar la gorra de jack y su guante, practicaba el deporte de beisbol sin jugar con un equipo por años\", julia voltea triste, dice \"ojalá pueda recuperar y poder mostrar lo de la 49, su vika sabía\" julia decide cambiar de dirección el vehículo aereo y sigue los instrumentos cuyo uso ha terminado de aprender con otro jack y decide darle una perspectiva de a lo que van a vika \"bien victoria vamos a la 44, donde me llevo jack y buscaremos conseguir registros o comunicandos de vigilancia, aparte de si sus aparatos estan en uso\", la vika se pone en guardia y contesta \"yo era quien manejaba eso, no es lo que habíamos planeado pero hare lo posible\", julia continúa pilotando el vehículo y dice \"tambien quizás te sorprenda o moleste el aspecto y el estado como quedo, así que volaremos alrededor, dime lo que sientes o si tienes problemas\", siguieron el vuelo y a lo lejos vieron a la torre con el puesto habitaculo en la cima y julia dice \"bien, ahí vamos\" y ven una de las paredes laterales transparentes destruidas, la maquina centinela destruida dentro y julia le dice a la vika \"de la batalla con esa maquina solo jack sobrevivio\", y la ve, palida y concentrada julia explica al hacer el final de la aproximación a la plataforma en lo alto \"el cuerpo o los restos de la vika que conocí estan enterrados en la base de el puesto, si quieres ...\", a lo que la vika le contesta \"no, no, esta bien, a lo que vinimos\", y julia aterriza, y abre el vehículo y desciende, voltea y se regaña a si misma *se me olvidaba que ellas no salían, hay que ayudarlas* y se acerca a el lado de vika y le tiende la mano diciendo \"vamos victoria, son solo unos metros\", y toma la mano de vika, esta estaba blanca y vika estaba paralizada,

46 y de pronto observa o siente que ya es el atardecer y julia baja la cabeza y parece esperar y de pronto voltea y camina hacia la plataforma de la alberca, y de pronto julia oye la voz de vika \"mal momento\", la voz se interrumpe por unos segundos, julia casi siente la sonrisa de vika 46, oye \"¿escuchas?, viento, ¿y la rotura de la pared transparente por la nave centinela?\", julia lo piensa un poco *¿habrá vidrios?, ¿plásticos?, frío aún no* y se desnuda pensando *bueno, una alberca en el rascacielos* y se lanza a la alberca, julia no ve la mirada sorprendida de vika 46 , ni oye el grito, al salir a la superficie julia ve a vika 46 inclinada al lado de el agua y oye \"oye\", le observa sonreír, \"creí que buscabas entrar y que el sonido de el agua era la pared venciéndose\", julia alza una mano y dice \"quien mejor que tu para saber si es seguro nadar, ¿vienes?\"; y julia se sorprende al ver que vika 46 le mira y le dice \"mmm, no, ahora no, ya esta atardeciendo y \", julia ve que vika 46 voltea y piensa *ouch* mientras escucha a vika 46 continuar \"hay que encontrar la forma de entrar\", ve a vika 46 voltear a verle \"y ayudarían bastante las herramientas de el vehículo aéreo\" y ahora es vika 46 quien le tiende la mano y le dice a julia rusakova \"¿si?\", y julia le toma la mano y se apoya en el borde y apoya la rodilla y se alza halándose, vika 46 le suelta y le mira, luego voltea y se encamina al borde de la estacion, julia le sigue con la vista y después se comienza a secar el cuerpo con las manos y camina hasta su ropa y la recoge, camina con la ropa frente a ella hasta el vehículo aéreo y se inclina a revisar. vika 46 ladea la cabeza al sentir el toque de una mano en el hombro, y dice \"julia, me debiste de haber tocado en el otro lado\" y voltea, ve que el viento mueve el cabello negro en tiras de ébano de julia rusakova y ve que la piel de julia rusakova muestra el efecto de el viento al secarlo, después ve que julia rusakova muestra las herramientas, cuerdas y algunos mecanismos y que, sin decir palabra, se aleja pasándose la mano libre por el cabello, mientras con la otra sostiene su camiseta y vika 46 le ve y piensa *¿cuantas ocasiones me ha secado el viento afuera?* y trata de recordar como se abrió la puerta vidriera cuando debieron de haber llegado jack 46 y ella a la caseta 46 pero no pudo recordarlo y suspiro, se inclino y realizo un inventario y decidió tomar la cuerda y un seguro de gancho de metal y se encamino a el vehículo; por unos pasos camino agachada pero después alzo la vista y vio que julia rusakova se había puesto la camiseta y se disponía a poner la ropa interior ya sentada de lado en el asiento, vika 46 se detuvo junto al vehículo y enseño las cosas a julia rusakova, julia rusakova le grito \"¡pero me esperas, eh¡, ¡digo, cuando trates¡\" y vika 46 se acuclillo y aseguro la cuerda en el vehículo y camino soltando cuerda en el piso, cuando llego cerca de el limite de la plataforma se sentó y miro alrededor, miro la pared fracturada o rota por la maquina centinela y los destrozos, pensó *pero, a los problemas inmediatos* y continuo el estudio de la maniobra de entrar por la rotura; vika 46 asegura de una manera practica la cuerda, dejando un espacio por el cual pudiera pasar el cuerpo de julia rusakova por medio de una polea rodamiento con palo o extensión y julia rusakova paso pensando *solo me falto una escalera puente, vaya vika*, y fue tomada ya dentro de la estación por vika 46, julia rusakova dice casualmente \"vika, bien, estaba pensando en suministros de la estación, comer una cena\", vika 46 levanta seria el brazo con luces de obscuridad y las asegura y dice \"una cena bajo las velas entonces\", después le dice \"sigueme\" y guía a julia rusakova por el local; en el dormitorio vika 46 esta ya acostada y de lado cuando julia rusakova se sube poniendo la rodilla y las manos temblantes y se deja caer controladamente y vika 46 duerme.[Chapter 3] julia despierta sobresaltada al escuchar gritos y extraños sonidos y se sobresalta aun mas al ver que vika 46 no esta a su lado en la cama así que ve para todos lados vigilante y ve luces encendidas lo cual la tranquiliza un poco ya que si fuera un ataque serían humanos terráqueos, que habrán trepado y no habrían encendido las luces, lo mismo que las maquinas centinelas que iluminarían con sus propios haces de luz, así que se levanta y camina siguiendo la luminosidad y llega a donde esta vika 46 y observa por sobre el hombro como la maquina centinela dispara sobre vika 49 y luego a jack 49 desactivando la maquina julia dice como susurrando \"vika 49 era como la líder practica y pragmática, jack era como el tecnico a domicilio, innovativo y arregla todo\", vika 46 se voltea y dice enojada \"sus funciones y perfiles\", aún viendo a julia vika 46 dice \"aquí vika, el equipo necesita ver el archivo 5455\" aparece el rostro femenino de la operadora \"hola vika , vemos que la humana que le pedimos a jack esta contigo, por lo que anotare que sigue habiendo problemas con jack\", vika 46 dice \"sigo investigando en que pude haber fallado\", oyen \"es comprensible, esperemos que corrijamos el error, aqui también tenemos problemas\" y vika 46 espero a que en lo grabado la latita con la planta fuera dejada caer por vika 49 y ahora es julia la que oye pasmada y asustada \"es todo por ahora\". vika 46 espera que aparezca el rostro de la operadora y dice \"a falta de jack yo voy a salir en el vehiculo volador, con julia\", el rostro contesta, después de unos segundos \"esperaremos su reporte,, esperamos que sea tan eficiente como siempre\", vika 46 le dice a julia \"preparemonos\" y abre unos anaqueles de ropa y calzado, julia dice \"¿me das permiso de tomar una ducha?\", vika 46 muestra visiblemente su exasperación pero dice \"buena idea\" y tomo dos toallas y dos bolsas con utensilios femeninos de baño; ya dentro del baño vika 46 le aplica algunos liquidos al cabello de julia y le cepilla bajo el agua, vika 46 susurra \"se que jack 49 viajo al espacio, ¿pero se tardo unos segundos de espera?\", julia duda y pregunta casi murmurando \"¿unos segundos de espera?, pero vika, esta grabado, en titan estaba el artefacto o estructura, unos minutos de retraso en contestar en transmición , o de varios meses de trayecto\".[Chapter 4] julia rusakova y vika 46 están revisando las cosas y el estado del puesto, mientras vika 46 abre la puerta de entrada julia asegura con cuerdas una de las hojas y la orilla rota y capta a un grupo de terráqueos que están sentados allá lejos y julia le grita a vika 46 \"¡vika, ya asegure la puerta, ¿estas lista?\", y julia le hace una señal y levanta el brazo señalando a el grupo a lo lejos, vika observa donde julia indica y la voltea a mirar directo por unos segundos y dice al fin \"tengo que reportar nuestro vuelo, esperáme\"; vika se sienta en el vehículo y dice \"vamos a revisar una bomba aspiradora de agua, la operadora insiste en que es prioritario, tengo unas coordenadas\", vika 46 se pone 2 dedos en los labios y luego se los pone por varios segundos a julia continuando \"yo conduzco, o yo piloteo\", mira a julia a los ojos \"lo de los dedos es de jack\",julia reacciono volteando los ojos, su mirada, al sitio donde estaba o esta el muñeco temblón y se pregunto por un momento si era el vehículo aéreo 46, 49 o 35 y cuando volteo a mirar a vika esta miraba al frente tranquila y conducía o pilotaba en aire limpio y soleado y vika 46 se las arreglo para recordar una coordenada de alguna otra maquina y tecleo sonriendo un poco y dijo a una sorprendida julia rusakova \"jack 46 me veía nadar y me dijo alguna vez de su posible plan, la planta\", julia rusakova asiente pero dice \"si, bien, entiendo, pero ¿y la costumbre de jack?\" y vika 46 ríe \"tablero, hay otros trucos que note, que cualquier seria vika creo que notaría\" . vika 46 charla un poco con julia rusakova durante el vuelo, entre otras cosas de la posibilidad o imposibilidad de los terráqueos de vigilar u observar los nados de los 49s o el nado reciente de julia en la alberca o en lo que sería el cañón de la zona 46, completa \"por lo del grupo de ayer\" y llegan a una de las maquinas bombeadoras de agua marítima y aterrizan, vika 46 saca la motocicleta y le pide a julia rusakova que la prepare y mientras vika 46 regreso al vehículo volador y lo programo para volar y grabar la gran maquina , dice \"es un pequeño riesgo pero no hay de otra\" casi a si misma, pero julia rusakova la oyo y separadas las dos observaron el despegue de el vehículo volador y julia rusakova hasta reacciono sorprendida al oír \"¿todavía no?\". julia rusakova conduce o maneja la motocicleta sintiendo el aire seco en el rostro y el cuerpo calido de vika 46 en la espalda, aun recuerda sus palabras \"ves tu ubicación\", julia rusakova lo pensó mucho después *¿tenemos gps?* y ahora empieza a oler la humedad, hasta vika 46 se alza y señala, un punto que se agranda en el horizonte; julia rusakova y vika 46 observan el gran salar y como se explican entre ellas observan la caída variable del agua \"por los vientos\" que distribuye ya rocío hasta su posición\" y ven algo que las hace voltear, una silueta que salta y mueve los brazos.[Chapter 5] julia ve y se dirige a jack 46 y un grupo de terráqueos que rodean una carretilla grande con una maquina, algo que noto julia fue que carecía de monitor pero que de todos modos algunos miraban hacia ahí, julia siente en su hombro la mano de vika 46 y señala hacia arriba, a la gran maquina bombeadora y gran deposito y julia observa, habiendo bajado la velocidad unos terráqueos colgados o sentados de ese monstruoso deposito cerca de el limite de la pared y la parte baja, pero observa colores de prisma de agua y el agua, pero no siente fresco, quizás gotitas de y por el liquido y se detiene junto al grupo; jack 46, bajo la mirada expectante de vika 46, saluda jovial pero casi formal a julia y piensa *¿qué será lo que sentiste julia?, la única julia rusakova, una mujer joven máximo madura que sabía que su jack era de vika la 49 y que ahora sabe que había pasado mas de 50 años en criógenía y hay jacks por todas partes* y contesta el saludo mas amistoso de jack de un beso en la mejilla y oye que jack 46 comienza \"que bueno que vienen, ¿algún problema al venir?\", vika 46 se le adelanta a julia, o quizás julia le dejo contestar primero \"ninguno en la ruta, pero estamos verificando porque esa cosa esta fuera de su lugar\", y señala a el deposito, continúa \"un encargo de la encargada de control, de la 49\", jack 46 baja la mirada y dice \"la encargada, esperemos que en la pantalla y solo por la pantalla de\", luego sube la vista y les dice a los terráqueos \"tenemos que hablar\". julia rusakova esta sentada en el suelo, explicando a vika 46, de pie, que las gotas de agua eran prismas y que la luz se dividia en 7 colores, antes julia había esperado a que sus manos tuvieran agua y se lo había puesto, un poco, a los ojos cerrados, pestañas, parpados cerrados de vika 46 y le dijo \"abrelos un poco\" y vika 46 vio colores grises y blancos y eso dijo \"veo tonos grises y blancos\" y julia sonrio enojandose con ella misma y le dijo \"de nuevo\" y le puso mas agua en los mismos puntos y le dirigio el cuerpo de vika 46 al sol y le dijo \"ahora abrelos un poquito\", y ahora vika 46 le dijo \"veo colores y reflejos\", patea el piso y pregunta \"¿porqué veo colores y reflejos?\" y julia se sento en el suelo y comenzo a explicar[Chapter 6] vika 46 percibe a lo lejos que jack 46 le hace señales para que vaya con el y vika46 le dice a julia \"me habla jack, ya sabes julia, hay que recordar que jack 49 lo dejo amarrado y tirado en el desierto, aún debe estar resentido\" , vika 46 le guiña un ojo a julia rusakova, \"pero tu eres la julia de todos los jacks\", julia se espanta un poco, solo asiente y dice \"las grabaciones de la 49\", vika 46 le dice \"calma, no se cuanto recuerdes de la pelea, por eso es necesario recordar, lo que hacíamos en nuestro equipo\", julia esta ahora seria, vika 46 se ríe y se levanta y mientras se levanta dice \"te faltan cabos sueltos, me faltan cabos sueltos, julia la ve alejarse hacia jack. julia rusakova, habiendo vika 46 ido a ver a jack 46, que era su equipo, recuerda, pero mueve de un lado a otro la cabeza, *son otros tiempos* había decidido de antes, y estaba en eso cuando se acercan unos terráqueos con un anciano de 80 o 90 años, de la guerra con los aliens, *... de la guerra con los aliens ...*, y otra vez empalideció, el anciano le dice \"vamos señora, no podemos ponerla siempre así, triste\", julia rusakova dice seria \"disculpeme son los recuerdos\", solo el entristeció, un terráqueo le trajo una silla, otro le trajo otra silla a julia rusakova, el anciano comienza, \"hasta que obtengamos y pilotemos los vehículos de las torres, nuestro campo de ... \" y julia rusakova escucho y escucho y dijo algo, que si creía que habían encargadas por cada torre o si creía que era una sola puesto que vika 46 había apareció en la torre 49, julia rusakova habló de inteligencias artificiales, el señor les recordó de las maquinas y el concepto de computadoras diferentes; ellos se fueron y julia rusakova camino buscando a vika 46 y jack 46 que no veía por ningún lado, y es que el olor y los recuerdos; julia rusakova ve que de entre un grupo de terráqueos sale vika 46 y se le acerca y la detiene, vika 46 le dice \"te señale que había terráqueos casi colgados ahí arriba en la maquina deposito, algunos de ellos habían visto y \", vika 46 voltea, continúa \"y comido animales así que buscaban ver animales marinos medianos\" vika 46 voltea a ver a julia, sigue \"atún, salmón, bacalao\", sonríe , \"y están cocinando, ¿hueles?, pero nosotras debemos de volver, ¿ok?\", julia piensa en lo que se le ha dicho y dice \"bien, volvamos\" y buscan la motocicleta e inician el viaje de retorno para encontrarse con el vehículo aéreo, vika 46 hablándole a julia de si tuviera un traje de buzo y otras cosas como buscar edificaciones limpiando el lecho de la fosa; vika 46 dice frente a la pantalla \"un día eficiente, le he mandado los datos\". julia esta con vika 46 al lado de la piscina y le daba a conocer de los gustos compartidos, los estudios compartidos de los originales jack y vika en geología y espeleología submarina y de cuevas o visales, \"bastante peligrosos\" dijo julia, vika 46 empezó a abrir la boca para decir algo cuando julia aparece los protectores de los ojos de la motocicleta o vehículo terrestre y se los da a vika 46 diciendo \"me debes algo\" y le señala a vika la piscina; cuando vika se desnudo y se metió al agua, julia rusakova mira el agua y le dice a vika 46 \"me sacas mi ropa, una zambullida, una pieza de ropa, ponte los protectores de los ojos y ve debajo del agua\", a julia rusakova si le preocupo que vika 46 batallara un poco para ponerselos.[Chapter 7] julia rusakova esta en los restos de el edificio señalado por la grabación de los últimos días de los centinelas o maquinas, que era donde la encargada había detectado la señal de sus biocapsulas, y recordó un poco de su pasado y uso un poco el mirador, pero no pudo hallar lo que buscaba, el sitio de su descenso no controlado, y uno de los terráqueos centinelas le dio una moneda y le dijo \"insértela, \" él le sonrió, continúo \"en realidad usted tendría que hacer lo mismo que jack 49 le hizo a nuestra boya, desactivarla o descomponerla\", jullia dice \"por lo que vika 46 esta en la torre 49, \" julia inserta la moneda y recomienza la observación sistematizada del horizonte, continúa \"por si la encargada\" julia hace una mueca, \"reacciona igual o hace lo mismo\", el terráqueo comprende su mueca y complementa \"que es lo que queremos\", júlia ve unas ruinas y dice viendo el camino \"voy a caminar un rato\", le indica con un \"vamos\" que la acompañara; julia acepta el silencio del terráqueo, petición que le hizo cuando julia volteando a ver el mirador le dijo \"yo y el jack original visitamos el lugar y pasamos un buen momento, el sitio en aquella época era altísimo, de mas de 100 metros de altura y grandes multitudes lo visitaban\", fue ahí cuando el terráqueo le dijo \"creo,\" y se apunta a su pecho ,\"yo, que hay que olvidar lo grandioso y ser prácticos\", el terráqueo mueve el brazo abarcando todo lo alrededor y le dice a julia \"esto es lo que quedo\", y julia estuvo en silencio y pensó *si, quizás sea lo mas práctico*, y penso en vika 46 en el puesto 49 y en los terráqueos corrigiendo o arreglando su aparato, todo eso para localizar vikas y jacks, cuando vió que había cerca un como ala gigante, que parecía un escalón o una banqueta y fue corriendo y barrio un trecho con el pie, julia penso y le dijo al terraqueo \"me imagino a jack pasando por encima con la motocicleta\" julia se agacha a ver el borde, continúó \"a veces se ve mas caminando\" y entonces vio a varios humanos, *que seguían el sonido de sus pasos*, y le hablo al terráqueo, que alumbro con un papel que encendió con la chispa de un encendedor sin gas, y vieron personas con los ojos ciegos y a pesar del color de la piel, pálidos; julia rusakova no se lo espero nunca, esas personas pusierón vasos de vidrio pegados al vidrio. julia despierta con sobresalto y ve la luminosidad, una de tantas diferencias entre los de las torres y los terráqueos, y todavía seguía pensándolo, comparando y hasta recordando en sueños *4 años de existencia dormida* y lo que les había recalcado, a todos, principiando con esas personas, sobrevivir a la guerra, a los desastres de la naturaleza, encerrados con comida pero en un lugar donde muchas cosas habían fallado o faltado, pero habían hablado y en esa forma de comunicación resonante juiia rusakova había dicho su nombre y ahí se recordaba de un gran viaje a uno de los planetas gigantes, la pregunta era \"¿se logro la misión?\". julia rusakova escucho la difícil historia de un edificio que estaba junto a una distribuidora de alimentos, vegetales y conservas que por los ataques de un enemigo constante y empedernido que parecía seguir y destruir lo que se moviera se quedo sin poder recibir o distribuir, el otro factor era el proyecto de generación de energía o poder del agua, con subproducto de oxígeno, y el cambio de su vista, eso si un problema.[Chapter 8] julia rusakova estaba en comunicación vía vasos con la gente de el edificio enterrado vía resonancia, ellos mismos le explicaban que su aire o atmósfera interior se generaba de motores o baterías eléctricas de conversión de agua a hidrógeno y oxigeno, que como debía saber siendo julia una astronauta habían aprovechado la ley de usar para producir lo mas necesario aunque pareciera un gasto de recursos, julia intentaba imaginar a que se referían y por eso ella seguía con su guardia terráqueo , solos, comunicandose con los brazos doloridos aún sin avisar a los demás, no fuera a ser que hubieran tenido que hacer cosas para sobrevivir, ella escuchaba y recordaba de ventanas extrafuertes, de doble hoja y recordó ella sola de galerías y grandes centros de espectáculos pero pensaba en los jacks y vika 46 y vika 35 y en lo peligroso que sería nadar bajo el nuevo lago, y julia rusakova siguió hasta que su guardia terráqueo le recordó que tenían que volver a la estructura del transmisor, julia lo mando; después julia vio a dos figuras que se acercaban, el terráqueo que la había acompañado y otro,que ella reconoció era del grupo de terráqueos que la acompañaron a tratar de poner en funcionamiento el aparato transmisor, él le dijo \"a mi me dejaron de guardia en\" se detuvo y continúo como si nada, solo viendo las ventanas \"a esperar su regreso\", él le indico al terráqueo que acompaño a julia que caminaran para estar mas cerca de julia y completo \"con el aparato volador\", julia entendió las precauciones y dijo asintiendo \"entiendo\", luego señalo a los ventanales y continúo \" yo creo que es de importancia que me este aquí\" , julia le señalo a los terráqueos a por donde vinieron y dijo \"ustedes vayan a reportar eso, que uno se quede vigilando el vehículo volador\", el que recién llego le dijo a quien se había quedado de guardia \"bien, dejemosla\", volteo a mirar a julia \"acompañese de ellos,\" le señalo a julia los ventanales \"se por experiencia que es lo mas difícil, no peligroso\", julia volteo a ver el atardecer y asintió, ambos terráqueos saludaron despidiendose de julia y desandaron el camino, julia se acomodo sentándose y uso el vidrio para decir \"¡voy a estar aqui\"; en el anochecer llego el vehículo aéreo, los subterráneos trataban de despertar a julia, del vehículo bajo una vika con el arma rifle, miro a julia, observo y dijo a través del vidrio \"ella es nuestra ozymandias\" y se sentó mirando a todos lados y de reojo a julia, pensö *estoy del lado incorrecto de la albera *, pues julia rusakova dormía y los ventanales estaban debajo, *como allá*.[Chapter 9] en la mañana julia ve que esta junto a ella una de las vikas, julia esta por preguntarle cual es cuando nota o siente o escucha a la gente subterranea y voltea a ver a los ventanales y varias y varios le señalan a la vika mostrando en papeles \"victoria olsen\" y en varios de esos papeles se añadía unos signos de interrogación, julia rusakova voltea y les trata de trepidar que si es ella, cuando ve un cartel donde están ella y jack de una misión de una época anterior a la guerra por los americanos, julia recuerda el nombre de jack harper y recuerda bromas de el sobre su apellido, de pronto siente un toque en el hombro, es vika que le dice \"antes de que me expliques me puedes decir si soy victoria olsen y ¿porqué te arriesgas así?\", julia se vuelve a ver en un recuerdo con los otros 6 que estuvierón en la misión y solo habla como mirando desenfocada \"tu eras la copiloto o astronauta victoria olsen, representante como otros 6 a una estructura que flotaba u orbitaba en júpiter, entre esos 6 estaba el astronauta jack harper y yo, su esposa\", vika 49 se acerca a julia y le dice \"¿júpiter?, porque lo demás es comprenderlo\", julia ve a la cara de vika 49 y le dice \"se sopesaron varias teorías de porque jupiter,naves nuestras como la juno, que les indicaría tecnología ahí, o la detección de algún elemento de suministro, en el planeta o alguno de sus satélites, o esperaron, ¿a quienes?, a nosotros\", vika 49 pregunto \"¿naves propias?\", julia le dice volteando al cielo \"si vika, ¿o te llamo victoria?, por ejemplo lo que vio jack, ¿comprender? 50 años flotando a la deriva de la inercia, o tu y jack en un encuentro después de 6 años de viaje, con algo que les hizo a jack y a ti tomar la determinación de separar el modulo con nosotros en biocapsulas\", vika 49 oye pensativa y julia sigue \"si, tu original y el original de jack eran los pilotos y estaban despiertos\", vika 49 pregunta viendo hacia arriba \"los rayitos cortos y líneas cortas que se vieron durante unos días en el cielo, ¿era tu modulo?, fue hace muchos años\", julia rusakova observa el cielo recordándose a ella misma observando el resultado de el plan de jack 46 y su sustituto, piensa *eso si duro días, no se como haya sido*, y a julia rusakova se le ilumino el rostro, contesto \"no se como haya sido mi reentrada, recuerdo de este tiempo, desde hace 10 años, el despertar con jack 46 y vika 46\", julia se sienta y palmea al lado suyo diciendole a vika 49 \"sientate, podríamos intentar abrir donde esta esta gente con el rifle, pero debe tener una entrada\", ve a vika 49 sentandose y sigue \"tu original era hace 70 años una astronauta así que tratemos de recordar, mira, todo objeto astronomico tiene por su masa una propiedad\" y voltea a ver a vika 49, que espera un poco antes de entender, vika 49 dice \"gravedad, lo que nos permite estar sentadas\", julia sonrie un poco,piensa *si*.[Chapter 10] al día siguiente, después de otra noche solas, vikáa 49 le dice a julia con una cara de seriedad que le llama la atención a julia \"julia, por lo que dicen los habitantes de este edificio subterráneo, nosotros fuimos enviados al espacio después de la gran guerra contra un enemigo que vino de ese mismo espacio\", julia sonríe triste y le dice a vika 49 \"sigue\", vika 49 continua \"el problema es, bueno, lo que trato de entender es , si derrotamos a ese enemigo, es lógico que nosotros fueramos encontrados como fuimos encontrados y haciendo lo que estabamos haciendo, digo ¿no? \", julia rusakova recuerda su despertar y ver a jack 46 y a vika 46 en un puesto que parecia habitación de hotel de lujo, realmente le había recordado el libro 2001 una odisea del espacio, algo que era una vida tan natural en las condiciones de antes de la guerra, su miedo de seguir en criogenia, de haber perdido la razón y fantaseaba, y eso le explico a vika 49, por lo pronto había que discutir con los terráqueos acerca de las informaciones o datos que esa gente, los subterrneos tenían, así que julia le pidio a vika 49 un resumen de lo que ella sabía de lo antiguo, de sus platicas o de las noches con los datos de las pancartas, así que vika 49 comenzo a hablarle desde las grabaciones del puesto 46; cuando llegaron los terraqueos julia rusakova y victoria olsen 49 les dijeron que tenían que hablar mientras cavaban.[Chapter 11] los jóvenes de los terráqueos que habían llegado comenzaron a intentar liberar la ventana de comunicación o visible; julia y vika 46 se apartaban con algunos veteranos, julia, al caminar, le dice a uno de los terráqueos viejos \"los edificios de antes de las catástrofes tenían entradas en los techos, las partes de arriba\", julia pasa su mano por arriba de su cabeza, luego la baja hasta casi tocar el suelo, continúa \"lo que sería nuestro piso o suelo, me parece raro que no tengan entradas o salientes por el techo, es mas, si pudieran limpiar hasta lo solido y ver si hay una configuración o relieve\", el hombre se puso una máscara y hablo algo, atrás a cierta distancia ya se oye un clamor y algunos tomaron picos y empezaron a picar en algunas partes, el hombre, junto a otros, solo le asintieron a julia y a vika 46; ya casi fuera de distancia visual julia se detiene y espera a que los otros y vika 46 se detengan, volteándose a verlos julia agarra la mano de vika 46 y dice \"esa gente recuerda que hubo la misión espacial a titan, la que iba a ser el destino de ella, las otras vikas y los jacks\", julia voltea a ver la mano de vika, continúa \"yo quisiera decir que trajeran a vika 35 para ser vistas juntas ella y vika 46\", julia voltea a ver a los demás, continúa \"quisiera expresar mi apoyo para ellos y quisiera que consideraran que es lo que les vamos a decir al momento de hacer contacto \", los terráqueos se ponen sus máscaras y julia y vika 46 escuchan una conversación de ruidos electrónicos, julia rusakova piensa *como si fuera al revés, como si su modo de comunicación fuera de extraterrestres*, piensa antes de hablar, puesto que piensa *a pesar de su comunicación interna deben de tener micrófonos para escuchar el ambiente* y julia voltea a ver a vika 46 \"estan usando un medio de comunicación interna pero deben de tener micrófonos de ambiente\", vika 46 le sonríe viéndole, julia se pregunta que pensara vika 46.[Chapter 12] en la relativamente lejana escena de una expectante muchedumbre que de pronto dirigían las miradas a los viejos que discutían con sus cascos o mascaras de comunicación y en alguna ocasión miraban a julia rusakova y a vika se empezaba a notar inquietud por la aparición de expresiones corporales que expresaban que en la discusión o conferencia había varias opiniones o por lo menos discrepancias, lo que fue notado por una vika que le pregunto a julia de que se trataba la discusión \"de los que respiraban y hablaban aire libre y normal\", julia le intento explicar diciendo \"una reunión como la que vemos es, como explique, hablan y discuten, la tardanza de terminar exaspera a los que esperan, realmente espero que hayas visto la grabación de mi capsula y como yo estaba como dormida,¿si?\", vika 46 contesto asintiendo con un movimiento de cabeza, esperando la continuación de la explicación de julia, julia continúo \"entonces yo pase mucho tiempo así, durmiendo, sin hacer mas movimiento que mi pecho al respirar, así esta gente se mueve, quizás sin querer, o se tensa, en respuesta o reflejo de lo que discuten\", julia tomo la mano de vika 46 y le dice mientras comienza a moverle la mano \"cierra los ojos, ahora, esto sería al revés y cuando vika 46 cerro los ojos julia puso su mano en su rostro y julia dijo \"mi frente es de piel seca por el sol, mis ojos son de cejas delgadas, no como las tuyas que son algo gruesas, y pestañas largas, que tu también tienes largas pestañas, ahora, recuerdo que en mis tiempos de antes, podrías ver que las mias son de color negro y tu verlo aún con casco ylas tuyas de color rojizo con tonos amarillos\" vika 46 fruncio el rostro tratando de recordar y julia rusakova dijo \"noto, yo, unos cambios en tu piel y en tus labios, eso, eso, es lo que ellos notan\", vika 46 rió, y asintió tratando de recordarse a ella y a julia, julia pensaba en cambios entre vika 35 y vika 46.[Chapter 13] de repente, de la muchedumbre, unos gritos, vika 46 voltea a ver pero baja la vista y mira su mano bajo la mano de julia rusakova, levanta la vista hacia el rostro de julia y ella mueve la cabeza como pensando o diciendo \"vamos\" sin soltarle la mano y empezo a caminar llevando a vika 46 un tanto nerviosa; los terraqueos hablaban entre si, pero vika 46 notaba que estaban un poco alejados y al acercarse se dio cuenta que había un mal olor muy fuerte y jalo a julia, ella para detenerla, escucho que julia decia \"el olor es de \", vika 46 completo \"es como la del agua y el pez,\" detuvo totalmente a julia terminando \"o los pescados\", julia espero y miraba ambas partes, la apertura del edificio y a vika 46, alguien las alcanzo desde atras y les pusieron a ambas cascos o máscaras; julia rusakova desperto con vika 46 al lado, había mascaras de otro modelo. fin ","Summary":" la rusokova, la única julia rusokova que el mundo conocía actualmente ya que ante la no sabida

More or less drunk already and full of fun the little group was on their way through the New York night life. One by one filed away home, until only Claire and her best friend Jenna rested together. They decided to have one last drink in the latest scene club and eventually got stuck there until 4 o'clock in the morning. Suddenly, Jenna felt sick and could barely manage it out on the street before throwing up. Claire wanted to call her a taxi, however as usual when needed the cabs were everywhere but there on the spot. \"There's a …sub station…\" Jenna murmured and tried in vain to put her messy hair in order. \"Think… gonna … make it.\" \"I don't think this is a good idea\", replied Claire. \"Let's go inside again and call a cab!\" \"No… need fresh air! I'm just fine… walking…let's go to the subway!\" The two girls stumbled towards the next subway entrance. Shortly after they sat on the station and waited for what seemed an eternity. Some shifters arrived at the opposite track, and then it was lonely again. Claire could not remember having seen that an empty station in all her life in New York. Granted, she had not been out that long… and she did not use the subway very often. Her overprotective parents would surely be worried…. But what the heck, she was 23 now, and at the moment and after the passed exams she felt over exited and ready for all kind of adventure the world could offer! Perhaps , she thought, I should color my hair black and wear contact lenses instead of these stupid glasses… uh… and I could learn to walk in these high-heels, Jenna likes! Yes, time to finish this mousy existence! She laughed and embraced her friend. Tomorrow she would go and buy some really high-heels… Finally, Jenna's train arrived and they had to part. With slow, dozy steps Claire went to the staircase. One instant later, she was wide awake, as two strong hands grabbed her. She squeezed her eyes, discerned two guys: a Latino-looking one and a bulky White with tattooed arms. They grinned. \"I… I have 50 bucks…\" Claire said hastily and fumbled in her bag. \"Good, take 'em as surplus!\" the Latino laughed and tried to rip the girl's jacket open. She cried and struggled in panic. She knew some Karate, but now she was far too boozy for that. Nonetheless, she got away, but only a second. Then the white boy had her in his grip again. He seemed to have much fun in her futile attempts to escape. \"Quite a wild cat, woowoo!\" he yelled. Claire called for help. No one answered; the station was as empty as if they were the last human beings on earth! She got a hit in the face and lost her glasses. Not knowing how, she ended up lying on the rails, one of the boys ready to jump down, too. Without a second thought, she was on her feet and on the run into the tunnel… When she stopped, totally out of breath, she realized no one had followed her. It was nearly dark around her, only a little light in great distance. It was moving… Claire tried to focus. A train… O God, a train! Desperately, the girl stretched to move her trembling legs away from the danger. But where? The train was fast, so fast! And she was not fast enough to get into one of the little worker's hide outs. The passing subway grazed her and threw her against the wall. === Underground near the shut down City Hall Station === Once, he bore the name Peyton Westlake. But this was in another life. A life, long long gone by now. He lived in the darkness of the underground for so many years, that he found the name some people had given to him fitting. 'Darkman'. Yes, a dark man, a shadowy creature hiding by daylight and only emerging at night! He knew there were some myths around about him already, exaggerated stuff the most, like it was the case with myths. The truth was, he was tired. Tired of making his researches without the smallest progress, tired of checking the tests, tired of waiting and tired of hoping. More and more, he felt too tired to even leave this dark cavern for a walk outside. Some years ago, he had lived for his revenge on the ones who where responsible for this miserable existence. But now, he had had his revenge. The criminals were dead; some of them he had killed with his own hands. It had not given him any deeper joy after a first bolt of satisfaction. Their suffering, their deaths could not undo what was done to him, could not give him his old life back, his face, his family, everything he had lost! With a sigh, he gave up trying to sleep and walked through the twilight of his hiding place. He had covered some of his sensitive equipment with plastic sheets; a thick layer of dust had settled down in the months. It looked as if a bunch of grey-clad ghosts where frozen in their movement by a powerful spell. In between, the remains of an old TV. He had smashed the screen in one of his rages, not willing to hear any more of these stupid advertising like \"anti-aging-creams\" or \"best electronic shaver ever\"… all this nonsense! And people out there spent millions to get these items, or they went through plastic surgery to look 20 years younger or more perfect. The thoughts alone made him outraged once. He would give anything to see a wrinkle in his real face! However, now he was only tired. Too tired to feel any anger and disgust. He let himself fell into the chair in front of the broken tube and stared in the shards, not able to fully suppress his pondering. How old I am now? Which date do we have? … I do not even know anymore the exact date, dammit! It's as if I'm already dead… How old? 42? 43? The Darkman does not know any age… I have the formula of ever lasting youth, you obsessed ones out there…do you want it? His laugh was an ugly sound. At this moment, Westlake heard a little whining, and discovered one of his animal companions closing in. It was Jerky, a bull terrier. He had found him some months ago, an abandoned puppy nearly dead. \"Hey, 'hat's goin' on? You already had your dinner, 'al!\" The dog whined and barked; he was used to the blurred manner of speech missing some consonants his master was condemned to and man bowed down and padded his back. \"Are you u' to a little 'lay? 'iddle o' the night? Ah… 'hat does it 'atter, it is al'ays night here, isn't it, hey?\" The dog barked again. His behaviour was quite unusual. The dog was somewhat nervous, it seemed, and wanted him to follow into the tunnels. What was there? An intruder? None of the alarm systems Westlake had set up so carefully went on… So whatever Jerky was about to show him, must be outside the perimeters of his 'stronghold'! Perhaps a rat nest or something… Nonetheless he traced the dog. Jerky was such a good and loyal friend, like all the animals he had down here. For them, beauty and perfection was not a face or a figure; with their senses they penetrated such superficial things. Why then, should he not please one of his only friends and walk with him to his gorgeous findings? … Claire woke up in the piercing torture of overall pain. She tried to move; it seemed the thought alone was hurting. The train…. I was… hit by the train…. It hammered in her like thunder. Something… someone… touched her. Rats, she thought with horror, but unable to even flinch a bit. Then she saw a silhouette hovering above her. A nightmare… a monster! She wanted to scream. A weak moan was all she could mouth. The she lost concsiousness again. … Slowly, Claire's mind crawled out of the hazy state where it had hidden itself for nearly a day. Her body and head were still aching, but it was not the wretching pain of last time she awoke. She felt better. Had someone found her, brought to a hospital? She turned her head, tried to discern her environment. It was that… dark! No, this couldn't be a hospital's room! Or… was something wrong with her eyes? She panicked instinctively – being blind AGAIN was the most frightening thing she could imagine! While attempting to raise, she recognized her right arm was neatly bandaged, and other patches were around her hands and, she sensed, around her head. She tried to sit up further, but felt gently pushed back the same moment. She could hear a voice now, but not see anything clearly. The voice was male, deep, but soft and with a distinguishing timbre. The times when she had to rely on voices and sounds to imagine her surroundings were long gone, but Claire had kept the habit of paying attention to these things, more than other people. This voice was agreable and not frightening or threatening at all, and she found some confidence in this. Maybe this was not a hospital, however there was someone taking care of her… perhaps this was a shelter for the homeless… or some place of the police? She wanted to speak, to ask, but she sensed her head lifted and a glass of water on her lips. Yes, she was thirsty… And suddenly … very tired again… She sank back, trying to keep her eyes open as she discerned a person walking around her bed. It seemed to be a young man, but no doctor's outfit, no police officer. She was so tired… her thoughts wandered off and her eyelids fell. === Bay Ridge / A luxurious manor === This place was the opposite of the all-around-the-clock-busy Manhattan with its traffic jam, skyscrapers, noise and hectic – normally. Around the expensive manors along the shore road, it still offered the calm charme of an aristocratic era. However, this morning, it was very busy and very hectic in one of these estates! Dr. Frank Deveraux, owner of a little but precious factory for military technology, walked off and on in front of the police department's chief Captain Baxter, like a tiger in his cage. \"I do not know for what I spend my tax money!\" Deveraux shouted for the umpteenth time. \"My daughter is missing for 20 hours now, and WHAT DO YOU DO?\" \"I'm sorry, I told you, I can't do anything. It's the law. We have to-\" \"Law, what's this law, for Christ's sake?! I have the last message by Claire from the 10th, at 10 PM, when she went for the party!\" \"Perhaps she is with one of her friends, Dr. Deveraux. They probably had a… quite intoxicating night, and went to sleep there.\" \"Not my daughter! She would call me, if she couldn't come home! She would not just vanish for 20 hours!\" He shouted again. \"Besides, I already talked to her friend Jenna. And she said having seen Claire the last time when she boarded her subway! My daughter could be in serious danger, held hostage by some maniac, injured, even killed! And you don't want to give the damn order for a search party!!! Ah, next elections I know who I will vote for!!!\" Anna, Deveraux' wife, put her arms around her husband, trying to prevent herself from crying and in the same moment calm him a bit. \"Darling, please, don't get upset that way. Captain Baxter does all he can. You know, a person has to be missing at least 24 hours before the police can jump into action.\" \"So, if the police does not want to take care of this situation, I'll do it myself! I-\" The ringing phone interrupted him. Nearly as fast as Anna, the worried father was there to answer it. \"Hello? Yes, this is Frank Deveraux…\" It was the Lennox Hill Hospital. He turned pale in hearing what they said, then let out an relieved sigh and leaned against the side board. \"Anna, they have found Claire!\" he whispered in her direction. === Lennox Hill Hospital / One of the offices === \"She was been found in the subway station?\" Anna Deveraux couldn't believe it. \"AFTER she got medical attention?\" As happy as she was to have her daughter back in relatively good shape, this whole thing sounded somewhat silly, as if a responsible person in the hospital tried to cover his or her failure! And after the emotional stress of the past hours, she wanted to vent this somewhere! The middle aged physician sitting on the desktop repeated: \"Yes, as I told you. The cleaning company found her this morning about 3.30 and reported to the local police station. She sat on one of the seats, cleaned and with professionally bandaged arm and under heavy sedatives. That's all I can say, Mr. and Mrs. Deveraux.\" \"Can we talk to Claire now?\" \"Yes.\" The medic stood up. \"Please, follow me.\" He was looking forward to get rid of these angry parents who seemed ready to sue him and the whole hospital for whatsoever. Some minutes later, Anna embraced her daughter, and Frank Deveraux took her hand, murmuring with slightly shaky voice: \"Claire, my little girl, do you know how worried we were about you!\" \"I'm so sorry, Mom, Dad… I'm so sorry…\" \"But you are safe, thank God you are safe! Everything is going to be fine, Claire.\" Anna caressed her as if she was a little child. \"What happened? We talked to Jenna, and she said you where with her in the subway…\" \"I was on my way up, to get a taxi. Suddenly there were these guys, attacking me…\" Claire covered the face with her hands. \"I was so frightened. I ran off, into the subway tunnel. A train grazed me. Then… I don't remember exactly, until I woke up here.\" \"The doctor said you was found already having had medical attendance, and someone had bandaged your arm. Who had helped you?\" If she spoke the truth, Anna Deveraux mused now – and she had no intention to believe her daughter lied – there was someone who deserved their gratitude for rescuing her, at least! Claire shook her head. \"I don't remember. I couldn't see anything… only blurred schemes. Lost my glasses, and it was dark.\" A voice , she thought. This voice… But how should I describe a voice? She was sure to recognize it again, though. Someone has helped me… someone living down there… \"Perhaps the memory comes back later, when the shock is over\", Frank Deveraux stated. He did not like the prospect his only child had been in the care of someone he did not know and she did not remember – even if obviously no harm had been done to her. \"Can I come home with you?\" \"I'm sure you can. I only speak with the doctor in charge.\" === Some days later / Underground near the shut down City Hall Station === Westlake was on his way back from a nearby homeless-care-station, where he had aquired some dog- and cat food for his companions. The bag on his shoulder, he stepped carefully down an worn out iron ladder and then crossed into the tunnel of an old sewer. Some time and some rusty and grafitti-sprayed doors later, he was on the ground of his 'stronghold' again. He could already hear Jerky barking and one of the cats just jumped down from her resting place and moved towards him – a grey shadow blending perfectly with the twilight. In his mind, the Darkman smiled. Then something else caught his attention. A little shiny piece on the ground… a coin perhaps? Nothing of value for him, but he could throw it and the cat would run after it for fun. So, he lowered down, not paying attention to the remains of an old broken strut shortly above the ground. The sharp metal scratched over the side of his hand and he recoiled with an instinctive movement. Some seconds passed, before he realized, what froze. He stared at the metal strut, then at his hand again. Tiny drops of blood ran along and fell down. But this was not, what absorbed him now. No, the pain! The short sense of PAIN was it! I shouldn't feel anything… they said I couldn't feel anything anymore…I have not until now… how is this possible? It took him a considerable amount of willpower to restrain from probing this discovery by a more violent attack against himself. He only stood there without moving, until the cat had reached him and twined around his legs. Now he finally picked up the shiny piece from the ground. It was a silver pendant; a little flower winding around a heart. He remembered having seen it on the bracelet of this young woman he had brought here some days ago. She must have lost it during the transport back to the subway station. He put it in his pocket. Perhaps he would make a collar for the cat…[Chapter 2] CHAPTER 2 Reach through the twilight You disappeared in the darkness of the night – I wanted to follow you but something stopped me (BLUTENGEL, song \"soul of ice\") === Bay Ridge / Deveraux Manor === Anna Deveraux lowered her voice until it was barely audible against the background of the chimney's fire. \"Frank\" – she never addressed him as 'Frank' except she was really concerned about something. He raised his head from the newspaper immediately. \"Yes?\" \"I think Claire should see a shrink. She still can't remember anything. Maybe she suppresses the truth. This can cause serious trouble, if neglected. I spoke with Lauren about it today.\" Up on the staircase, Claire backed off as silently as possible. She had been on her way down to the kitchen to get something to drink. What? I don ' t need a psycho-shredder-thing! And certainly not by Mom ' s best friend! I ' m fine! She went back into her room and her bed again, but let the light switched on, a habit reaching back to her childhood days. Days of darkness, of blindness. Even if it was not dark anymore if she opened her eyes now – she liked it more if at least one little light was on. === In the Underground === I should not feel any pain. I should not feel anything! They separated the nerves from my spinothalamic tract. There ' s no way I COULD sense anything! Peyton Westlake repeated this again and again, still incredulous after hours of self tests. His fatigue was completely gone and had given place to his old scientific curiosity. Nonetheless, he had no neurological equipment for more sophisticated checks. However, it was clearly no figment of his imagination. The result was the same. Every time. He could feel some sensations, in certain parts of his body, mainly the right side. His hand was the most responsive. But he sensed strong heat and coldness on the skin of his legs, too. How is this possible? He stroke over his face and massaged his neck. He could even feel the coldness of his fingertips. What happens to me? How can this BE?! He recalled the damned implant this criminal physician had put into him. But he had removed the item then. Except a nasty infection, which had pinned him with fever in his bed for days, nothing had remained. No side effects whatsoever! He had been as unresponsive to pain and other physical stimuli as before. So, the implant from years ago could not be the source of this… this… Westlake was not sure how to call this change. He did not believe in wonders. A curse, rather? Will I completely loose my mind? Or find a method to control the rages? One of the cats jumped on his lap. It was the grey one, the oldest. Smokey was her name. Somehow, despite all his sinister musings, the Darkman suddenly felt a nearly childish flame of joy inside. He stood up, with Smokey in his arms (who looked not quite happy) and danced through the cavern. He could feel again! === In the streets of New York === \"My gosh, that must've been terrible!\" Claire's friend Jenna said, while the two young women walked through the shopping lane. \"I feel so bad about this…\" \"It wasn't your fault. The mayor should pay more security personnel in the subway, my dad said, and that's right. I won't take the subway anymore, anyway. Dad will buy me a car. Then I will always be late, because of traffic!\" Claire rested and watched the display in one of the expensive clothing stores, but without really paying attention. She thought of the plan sending her to a shrink. She had escaped this so far, and she did not want to talk about it to her friend. In the opposite corner the miserable figure of an old homeless cowered, trying to find some warmth. Had it been one of these people who had rescued her down in the subway, she wondered. Perhaps he had been afraid he would end up in jail if he showed with me in the condition I was then… If I only could remember something… \"Hey, Claire! Hello? Where are your thoughts?\" Jenna waggled her right hand in front of her eyes. \"I asked you what you think of this scarf there. Would it fit with my hair color or not? Should I rather take the cashmere one?\" \"Ah…uhm… sorry. Guess I'm a little tired. I would say, take the cashmere.\" It was one of the fastest decisions she had ever made, not being interested the slightest in the matter, now. Jenna smiled and hugged her. \"I am sorry, my dear! Shouldn't have dragged you along on this shopping tour so soon after the incident!\" When Jenna entered the shop, Claire preferred staying outside. … Half an hour later her friend showed up again and wanted to persuade her going in for shopping herself. \"I cannot\", Claire replied. \"Not enough money anymore.\" \"What?! You took over a hundred Dollars with you! What did you do in the meantime?\" \"I gave some bucks to him… ok, lots of bucks\", she said, with a gesture to the homeless. Jenna gaped. She looked as if she had just seen a green-skinned Alien walk past her. \"You're kidding, right? … Come on… you can't be serious!\" \"I am.\" \"All this flee bag will do is buying booze or drugs! And you waste your money?!\" Jenna's reaction made Claire angry, because she started to feel silly about her decision some minutes ago. \"I did it, okay?\" She retorted defensively. \"Just drop the topic!\" \"Hey, calm down! Didn't mean it that way.\" She caught up with Claire again, who marched in front of her. \"What I wanna say is, it's not OUR responsibility if some people screw up their life! It's the job of the Salvation Army or the Local Welfare! You shouldn't rack your brain about this… Woa… this scum is stinking! The shop should have a security here to remove him… Let's go over to \"Toni's\", I'm starving!\" Claire sighed and then shook her head. \"No… thanks. I'm really tired. It's better I go home and take a nap.\" \"Okay. Whatever floats your boat! I accompany you to the cab station, then. Hope you are fine again tomorrow, for Peter's party. You know, my brother finally got his lawyer's diploma!\" \"Yeah… of course. I'll be there.\" However, Claire was not so sure about it. She was not sure about many things, lately. === Two weeks later === \" Claire, are you really sure? This kind of… work…?\" Anna Deveraux had asked with a timbre betraying her disliking. \"I appreciate your social engagement. But… wouldn' t it be better if you participate in our annual charity ball, instead of distributing food in a homeless ' kitchen?\" \" I' m sure, Ma\", she had answered. \"It will be no problem. I already spoke with the responsible, Mrs. Copperhead. I can work one day a week in the kitchen. This won ' t be too much! It would only be for some weeks, until I take up my master-studies. And I won ' t start until my arm is healed, of course… \" Now, two weeks later and standing behind the distribution desk of the kitchen near the Central Station, Claire remembered these proud words and had to revise them a bit. The work was straining. Her legs hurt and sometimes she found it hard to overcome the repulsion she sensed. Some of the homeless waiting in a line were in that bad shape, dirty, toothless and ill… and, as Jenna had said, stinking… … The Darkman closed his coat and grabbed his hat. He did not exactly WANT to go out, but he had to: Jerky had injured his pawn on a rusty nail. A visit in the veterinary's clinic was better, he decided after trying to help his dog in vain. It was one thing if HE died – but not one of his furry companions right under his nose! Therefore, Westlake went on his way, the head covered with bandages as always the last year when he left his underground stronghold. He had used his artificial skin only when he had cared for this girl some weeks ago – in case the sedation won't work properly, he had not wanted to scare her to death with the view of a monster! But the durability of this 'prosthesis' was still limited to 120 minutes. This was the most he could achieve, given he was not exposed to plain sunlight! And 120 minutes were not enough to get Jerky to the vet and back… As expected, the people in the waiting room at the vet's clinic stared at Westlake as if he would spread a contagious disease, notwithstanding that his cloths were clean and orderly. A child carrying a little rabbit and watching him in curious awe, was actually snatched by her mother and started to cry. This was, what hurt him most, even after all those years, all this time he had not gotten used to it. This pain was nothing any surgery could remove. The gazing of the people, full of disgust and horror the ones, with awkward mercy the others. No one treated him like a human being. In his former life, he had worked with a lot of more or less disfigured persons, due to his profession. He thought having treated them with respect and humanity. Now he was in their place… and he was an outcast, a monster for everyone else. He sat down near the door, padded Jerky and waited. Perhaps, it flashed through his mind, it was a curse indeed to partly regain his ability to feel. It would only make the loneliness more devastating. Nearly 3 hours later the dog and his master were on the way 'home' again. It was already getting dark. Jerky was in playful mood again, after the medication. Despite the bandage on his leg, he jumped and 'fought' against the leash. Looks as if you need some serious work out! But Westlake was hungry and when he discovered one of the Salvation Army's soup kitchen on the other side of the road, decided to line in. A table was there filled with different donations from local super markets. However, the favorite in this wintertime was surely the hot soup and coffee! An elderly woman in uniform distributed slices of bred. Next to her, a young woman, obviously a volunteer, looked after the soup. And… she seemed familiar… Stepping closer, the Darkman recognized her face. It was the girl he had rescued in the subway some weeks ago! She looked fine again; so everything went well for her. Good – he had hesitated first letting her sit in the subway unconscious and waiting for the cleaning team to find her. In fact, he had been standing in the shadows observing until he had been sure she was safe. He advanced in the line of the waiting, a very unruly Jerky at his side. Only for a very brief moment the ridiculous fear this woman might recognize him crossed his mind. Yes, really ridiculous, he scolded himself, closer to cry than to laugh, though. The moments when he forgot his appearance, became rarer and shorter, nonetheless it happened from time to time. Suddenly, Jerky jumped up and barked like mad. Another man, a young black with ragged cloths and a mutt of a dog had come. Already drunken, he bleated and tried to push Westlake and two other people aside. \"Ey, get your fucking dog outta my way!\" A gramp with long beard opposed and tried to calm the youngster, with the only effect that he yelled even louder about \"white assholes\" and the \"fucking government\". Westlake raised his hands to show he would recede and leave the place. All of a sudden, the young man had a knife in his hand. Before the officer from the Salvation Army could step in, Jerky was about to attack. Westlake seized him in the last second; and only he with his superior strength was able to get the bull terrier down and appease him with hasty words. The other people stood around him, while the angry youngster used the opportunity to grab a bunch of food and then get lost. \"It's okay. He 'on't do anything. Ha' hi' under control. 'lease… all okay.\" The Darkman stood up again from the pavement, Jerky firmly in his grip on a short leash this time. The bearded old man stepped closer. \"Just wait aside here, man. I get you a nice cup of soup. And something for the dog, too.\" \"No, thanks. It's okay. I go.\" Claire listened. Listened very carefully. First, she watched, too, but then she closed her eyes and just listened. It was him! No mistake. She was absolutely sure. The voice was a little blurred, not as clear as she remembered, but the characteristic intonation and timbre was there! Ah, moreover, he was about to leave! Alarmed, Claire turned to her colleague nearby. \"Uh…Mrs. Copperhead? Sorry, I got to go for a moment!\" Not waiting for the – supposedly negative – answer, the young woman ran away from her place, and around the table. \"Wait! Wait, Mister!\" However, the man in the long brown coat and with the strangely bandaged head was on the flight the next second. \"Please wait! Just wanna thank you!\" He did not stop, and with his long legs, was much faster. Two lanes further Claire saw him lifting a gully cover and vanish inside. In the twilight of the evening, she did not trust her own eyes for a moment and simply stood there. But the Darkman was gone. Claire sighed. She felt bad somehow without knowing why. She owed this man her life, and could do nothing for him, not even say thanks or give him a warm soup. She had considered herself beaten by destiny so very often because of her bad eyes or her boring hair or anything else now sounding very stupid to her. Other people had experienced far worse, obviously… A pang formed in her stomach when she walked back to the kitchen. === Somewhere else in New York === A nearly empty faceless apartment. A man shutting down his laptop, cursing. A moment later, his celly rang. On the other end was an angry voice. \"No, dammit, no success yet\", the man on the laptop answered. \"Can't get into his computer! It's a high level firewall protection. What do you think, what I'm doing here? Hacking into a high school-computer system? … Yeah, yeah, I know… I know Chang will see results. And I promise, I'll deliver them within a week.\" + I hope so,+ the voice from the celly sounded. + You know what's at stake! We need these schematics, and if we can't break into this damned computer, we get the information out of his brain! Understood? + ….to be continued…. Please review….thx[Chapter 3] \" Was it an angel ?- It must have been an angel with broken wings\" (BLUTENGEL, Song \"Soul of Ice\") === Bay Ridge New York / Claire's home === When Claire arrived at home, she was still upset and disturbed from her experiences in the soup kitchen, and this not because of the reprimand by Mrs. Copperhead for leaving in the middle of her work. She thought of this man with the bandaged head. Why did he run away? Who was he before he ended up in this misery? She knew many stories about the homeless already. Some Mrs. Copperhead told her to prepare her for the work, others the people shared themselves when they waited or sat there eating. Claire had heard of lost work, lost family, drug addiction, crimes and prison – a road leading deeper and deeper down into the crap if on it once. Some had been betrayed by family and friends, robbed by their relatives. Others had speculated too high, invested in the wrong goods. Suddenly they crouched out on the street without anything and with nearly everyone their enemy ready to steal the little rest left. Mrs. Copperhead mentionned the \"mole- people\", too. \"mole-people\" – called after the non-human monsters of this old Science-Fiction classic… The ones who lived underground, in the subway or other tunnels, in darkness… This was the most awful imagination she possibly could have. In darkness like in a grave…Seeing nothing… And this man? He had helped her – and like the nurse in the hospital had said, quite professional. He had not even taken her watch, her bracelet or her expensive cellphone. The only thing missing was a little pendant, nothing really special or precious. She assumed to have lost it in the tunnels during her flight. At first, Claire wanted to talk with her parents about the encounter. However, her father was still at work (some super secret new rocket guiding system, this was all she knew) and she found not being able to tell it her mother. She simply did not know how to start. It was true, Anna Deveraux had talked about huge gratifications for the one who had saved her daughter's life. But… promising in this mood was one thing, talking about this encounter another. Perhaps her Mom would donate to the homeless-fund and this would end the topic for her. Worse, bring up the shrink-thingie again. Better not! So, Claire ate her dinner and then went into her room. She had mused calling Jenna, but figured out she could not speak to her about this, either. She could imagine her best friend's look hearing this story – a mixture of disgust and amusement about 'odd obsessions'. Is it 'odd' to think about a person who has saved my life? More than thinking for hours about the right pair of shoes for one evening? Claire stood up from the bed in which she had laid down without finding sleep and, with a glance to her buzzer, realized that she was pondering about this stranger for hours now. How weird! Really. Perhaps Jenna would've been right thinking this… Nonetheless, Claire switched her computer on and began a google-search for 'mole-people' and related subjects. About three o'clock in the morning her mother knocked. \"Claire, darling? Everything alright? Frank saw light in your room when he came home…\" The young woman rolled her eyes. As nice as her parents were, sometimes they treated her like a kiddie! \"Of course, Mom! Couldn't sleep and was reading a bit!\" \"It is this work with these homeless. You are not made for this kind of occupation, believe me, Claire. You are far too frail. You should stop it.\" \"I'm fine. Don't worry.\" Sighing silently, she shut down her pc and went to bed again. Still, her mind could find no rest. Mole-people. Darkness. Poverty. She felt pity. She wanted to do something for this man. Somehow… He had looked that… haunted before he fled. === In the underground near the Central Station === …\"Peyton, there's something I want to talk about with you.\" Julie Hastings smiled and shove her curly brown hair back. \"I hope you'll have time this evening?\" \" For you I have always time. I'm nearly done with the last tests. I can leave right now and we go out for dinner!\" He stood up, grabbed his jacket. Julie was already at the door. \" Julie, wait!\" She still smiled, but walked further, strangely without turning away. Her figure only went smaller and her silhouette was dissolving. \" Julie! Wait! JULIEEE!\" Westlake startled from his sleep, looked around through the dimly illuminated surroundings. His heart raced and he felt a suffocating pain clutching his throat. When he touched his face, he discovered it was wet from tears. He took a deep breath. He hadn't dreamt of his lost fiancée for years. It must have been the encounter with this young woman in the soup kitchen. Something in her, the way she looked at him, had reminded him at his last meeting with Julie. A meeting which he broke up by running away at last. Westlake had never seen her again; all he knew was that she lived in New Jersey, with a husband and two kids. He was grateful that Julie at least had a life, a real life. Something he was not able to give her anymore. He was glad, yes. Was he?! All of a sudden, his despair burst out in a violent flame of rage. He took an old strut and smashed it over the cooking items, a newspaper storage and a pile of data disks. The pain he felt in his palm as the metal cut the skin only made him madder. He could feel again – for what? For what this joke of nature, against all medical theories?! FOR WHAT? The next hit would have destroyed some of his research equipment. Only Smokey the cat prevented the worst, because she was old and a little slow, and Westlake nearly scraped her tail. The cat jumped up, with a panicking shriek, and he let his makeshift weapon fall immediately, back to his senses. No, he would never hurt his cats or another of his animal friends down here! Never, never he would allow that to happen! Smokey crouched behind a container now and regarded him with wide-open green eyes. \"Sorry… sorry old 'riend…co' out… 'lease…\" Some time passed before the cat showed up again. Westlake kneeled on the ground and waited, until Smokey put her head in his hands again and purred. He cried again. I have to learn to control this, he thought. Don't want to loose my senses completely and become an insane maniac… He decided to take a walk through his realm to get a clear head and check, if something else was wrong. === Somewhere nearby in the underground === The man in the stealth outfit opened a graffiti sprayed door and vanished into another world, which was the opposite of the one he just had left. The place behind the door was clean, first of all, properly lighted and filled with the soft hum of several electronic devices. A young guy sat on a table and turned around when he heard the newcomer. \"So how's goin'?\" \"Shit.\" The other man fell on a metal chest standing on the ground. \"Our source inside dried out.\" \"What? How'd you manage this shit again, Diego?\" \"I had no other choice. This asshole freaked out and I caught him calling the police. Bastard!\" \"Yeah… these business types are weakies… First greedy like hell, then whiny lil' kiddies.\" The man in the stealth outfit spit on the ground and searched for a cigarette. \"Don't\", his companion warned. \"No smokin' in here. Sensitive equipment.\" \"Fuck your equipment, man! Have you got access to the damned computer yet?\" \"Only partially. The schematics for the guiding system are secured with random password protection. We need a code to break the code.\" \"We won't make it in a week…\" Diego lightened a cigarette despite the protests. \"The boss will feed us to the piranhas…\" \"It's YOUR fucking fault! You killed our only inside source!\" The two criminals were ready to jump at each other's throat. Only the beeping alarm of one of their systems hindered them. \"What's it?\" Diego poked against one of the screens, showing a tunnel system. In the twilight, the silhouette of a man in a coat showed up, walking slowly down to the old water pipeline. \"It's only one of these creeps. Mole-people, drunkards. … I could go out and finish him.\" \"And draw attention or what? Creep yourself! Let this scum go, isn't a greater problem than the rats! Let's think about our REAL prob! What do we have for now to present it Chang?\" Diego fumbled in one of his pockets and threw a CD over the table. \"Basic schematics and all sorts of related stuff.\" …. The Darkman passing by in not such a great distance from the hideout wondered about the fresh footsteps in the mud. Normally, no one of the other homeless living in the underground came that deep and close to his 'stronghold'. He had to be more alert the next days… He did not want anyone down here. This was his refuge, the last barriers no one should take down! The more time passed without human companionship, the more he got anxious and reclusive, willing to close tighter the walls of his self-chosen prison. === Four days later / Bay Ridge / Claire's home === Claire had literally moved the thought back and forth in her mind, until she was finally resolved to make it reality. She would step down into the sewer herself and bring something with her to show the unknown rescuer her gratitude. He had not showed up again at the soup kitchen – what she had hoped – and the more she was concerned he would need some help. She had heard about the first homeless this year dying in the cold weather… Of course, there was one thing, one HUGE thing making her push away the decision again and again. She would have to go down. There were rats. There were spiders and other little critters. It would stink. Probably there were people in the underground not so kind as her helper. And: darkness! Claire was afraid, her heart raced at the imagination. She could hear her mother talking in her mind \"It is too dangerous. What do you think, Claire-darling? Are you out of your mind?\" Am I out of my mind? She asked herself again and leaned back. In front of her on the ground was a backpack, already stuffed with nearly the whole household's pharmacy. Someone living in the underground would need these items… Two Maglites with batteries sufficient for a week-long expedition also rested in the bag. Nonetheless, Claire was nervous. She had mused about taking a drink, like Jenna did to overcome her fear of flight. But what if she slipped down there? And then… would need help again instead of providing it? No, alcohol was not an option! I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. She repeated this to herself like a Mantra. Around midnight, she stepped down into the kitchen and filled other useful things in the backpack. It looked as if a robber was on his tour! She smiled a little, but the very next moment her anxiety prevailed again. She was only hoping her mother did not catch her doing this. Eventually, she had everything she wanted. On the way to the door, the young woman stopped again. Everything? What else a homeless could need? She looked around. Yes, some blankets, perhaps! She ran back into her room to take one at least and left her home packed like someone going on a winter hike. === In the underground === Claire had informed in an internet board about possible entrances to the New York underground. She took a cab up to Central Station, then walked down into the direction where she had seen vanishing her rescuer in the sewers some days ago. It was cold and misty, a really nasty weather. Perhaps a snowstorm would come soon. It was said to be warm down there, but Claire could not quite imagine it would be a comfortable place to let the winter pass … She was freezing and fear rose up in her, as some drunken people showed up on the other side of the street. I should've taken Dad's gun with me … she thought. Not able to lift the gully cover, she entered the underground via an open basement nearby, which had been marked in the internet board. From there, a short tunnel (probably left over from the times of prohibition last century) lead down into a shut down subway part. Claire shivered. Every step cost her new and more effort. She hated this: darkness, strange noises, dirt, the smell of rotten things! After some minutes, the urge to flee back upwards was nearly overwhelming. This had been a crazy idea! A donation to the homeless fund would've been enough and less dangerous! And how could she be certain to find this mysterious man anyway? Perhaps he had left the city, or was in a homeless shelter! Claire's hands were that sweaty that she let her flashlight drop. It fell down into the waste water with a clanking sound, was out and gone. Claire was in panic immediately. The time until she had unpacked her other Maglite and switched it on was a horrible one, filled with the darkest imaginations. Finally, she had managed it. She was surprised to find a pair of curious green eyes staring at her. A cat! The animal did not look neglected, but had shiny and thick fur. It meowed and twined around her legs. Now, Claire discovered the collar and the little pendant on it. It was her's! That meant…. The young woman smiled. It was weird, but the presence of this cat which seemed not shy at all, gave her a sense of security. She followed the grey animal further down the tunnel, through doors and under spiderweb-covered arcades. Until the gloominess lightened up and she could discern parts of a human installment in the distance. However before she could react, a voice reached her. His voice! \"Who is there? Don't co' closer!\" \"It's me, Claire. You have helped me in the subway, some weeks ago, after I was hit by the train. Do you remember me?\" She tried to see something, but a shadow was all she could figure out. \"Hello? Don't be afraid. Only want to thank you.\" She stepped forward. \"Stay 'here you are!\" He said more, but she could not understand the blurred words. Yet it was obviously he was afraid she would see anything … anyone… Perhaps he has illegal stuff here , Claire mused. \"I have no police with me, I'm all alone!\" She assured, finding it more than strange to talk to someone she could not see. \"I brought you some food and medics… In case you need anything. Hello? … I put everything down here, okay?\" \"Thank you.\" The voice sounded a bit closer now, but still nothing was to perceive. \"You are 'ery kind.\" \"Uhm… you were kind to me! So… do you need something else?\" She thought at the bandaged face she had seen in the soup kitchen and added: \"Any special medical help? I could get you to a doc.\" \"No. Need nothing. You ha' to go!\" (tbc – next update will come in 4 weeks, because I'm on vacation in Egypt)[Chapter 4] (managed to write another chap before I go into vacation! Please review, thx) CHAPTER 4: A Drop Of Hope === Bay Ridge / Claire's home === \"What did you think? Heavens, Claire, do you have any idea what could've happen to you on this… this… nonsense trip?\" asked Anna Deveraux despite the fact she had done so quite often during the last 30 minutes. Claire sat on the couch in the living room. Her mother had already expected her half mad of fear, after she had discovered the lights on in Claire's room and her daughter missing in the middle of the night. When she arrived back at home, her dirty boots and smelling cloths betrayed every attempt to find an excuse like 'I've been with Jenna'. Therefore, Claire had told the plain truth – and was covered with reprimands and worries ever since. \"Mom, I've met this man who rescued me\", she made a last effort to show her family the bright side of this adventure. \"You said yourself we have to show him our gratitude somehow! And I thought –\" \"Showing our gratitude does NOT mean you should go down into the sewers for that!\" Mrs. Deveraux raised her hands and shook her head. \"What did you think, Claire-darling?\" She started her lament again. \"But-\" \"These people living down there, they are… well, how should I describe it? They are not only dirty. They are probably drug or alcohol addicts. Junkies, do you understand?\" I'm not five anymore! And I worked in the homeless' kitchen! However, the young woman was in no mood to drag this discussion further. \"…Often they have psychological problems. Lauren told me once about an awful thing happening to one of her colleagues. I don't want to repeat it. All I try to say is, these people can be dangerous. One second, they play nice guy, and in the next, they press a knife against your throat. They are… like animals. Yes, that's it.\" Before Claire could react in any way, her father cut in. Until now, Frank Deveraux had listened silently. Now he ended the arguing with a determined \"You won't go there again. And you'll stop this engagement at the soup kitchen. It obviously had a bad effect on you. Now go to your room.\" Claire hated it to be treated like a child. For her parents, she would never be grown up and her Bachelor's graduation was worth nothing! And the incident in the subway had made things worse, of course. She sighed. Why the heck hadn't she called a taxi instead of complying Jenna's wishes?! Nonetheless, she went upstairs without another word. Crawling under her blankets, she recalled the events in the underground. It had been scary, yes. However, she could not imagine her mysterious rescuer to freak out and attack her. He seemed very… cultivated. Claire remembered walking back the way through the tunnels she had came before, alone. Then, he was suddenly behind her like a ghost or a predator and declared \"I will escort you. There are many unpleasant things around here.\" First she had not even dared to look at him. He had been that reclusive… Maybe he would do something nasty if she stared at him, she had mused. But when a fat rat crossed their path Claire jumped sideward, found herself face to face with him accidentally and was more than amazed to discover a rather handsome young man. Not that he had spoken much. Although Claire had realized that suddenly his words were not as blurred as before, more like she remembered from her time being in his care first. She was curious why he had used these weird bandages when he came to the soup kitchen – he seemed not mutilated or attaint by any skin sickness. She did not ask, though; this she judged very impolite. But she pondered again about the strange situtation and this strange man, while she lay in her bed now. === Meanwhile / In the underground === Peyton Westlake had reached his stronghold again, carefully detached the mask of surrogate skin from his skull and placed it into the kryogenic storage. There it could rest until it was needed again… Then he went checking the goods this woman had brought. The thought felt oddly out of place. Not only that he was not really in need for the things he now unpacked – even if it was always nice to have extra food, especially this good one, and medication. But the fact, that someone just had CARED for him… He shook his head, while he unwrapped another meat can. As the years had passed by, he had assured himself quite often that he cared about no one anymore. Of course, he had helped this or that person with money he had stolen from criminals, but this was not really CARING. It was just some superfluous stuff he did not need and therefore easily could give away. He did not help because of the urge to alleviate the sorrows of some people, but to be a pain in the ass of others. This was part of his revenge. So he kept saying for years. However, revenge had lost its meaning, had become a withering, fading old paper on which the words were vanishing. The Darkman would never have admitted this, but the only person he really did not care about anymore was himself. He took a box with sausages from the backpack. 'For your dog' was written on it. His face contorted to the remnants of a smile. Suddenly, he felt warm inside. She has thought of everything… A remarkable woman with a good heart… Something he considered to be very rare. A lot of people, the most perhaps, were greedy, clutching cold hearted on their own success and threw every other person aside hindering them to get it. Jerky whined at his side; already he had smelled the sausages. Westlake unpacked one of them and gave it his four-pawned friend. On the botton of the backpack rested four bottles, carefully wrapped in old magazine pages. But it was not the content which had pinned his attention. It was the text on one of the crumpled pages! It seemed to by some sort of Journal of the Columbia University, issue last month. And the words printed there pierced his mind: '…announced during the annual conference of our medical department a breakthrough in bioengeneering. Professor Varinapam declared being able to create durable living skin samples for surgical transplantation. The base of his work, novel-prize winner of 2001 Varinapam said, were the researches of Dr. Peyton Westlake, who tragically died ten years ago without being able to finish his promising work…' Where was the next page?! Hastily, he unpacked the other three bottles. There! At least a part of the text! '… Flaws in the creation process, which lead to a rapid cellular degradation as soon as exposed to certain wavelenghts of light. After searching for years for a solution, Professor Varinapam discovered a DNA-resequencing procedure using genetic information of deep-sea species. The main line…' Dammit! No continuation! He stared at the pages until his eyes began aching, without even noticing Jerky's begging for another sausage or the meouw of the cats. Durable living skin samples for surgical transplantation… How often he had dreamt of reaching this mark; how desperately he had hoped! Thousands of times, again and again – without getting the desired result! Now it had been done! It had been DONE! Westlake stood up from the ground, feeling dizzy from exaltation. Hope was back. It had lasted years to kill the hope – but it had needed only a little spark to ignite it again. And a tiny drop of hope was enough to transform his ocean of despair. He had to meet this Professor Varinapam! He had to speak with him by any means! His heart raced in exitement. How to find that scientist? Columbia-University… this was a Journal from the university, so he highly probable worked there. He ran to find the phonebooks for the city. They lay dust covered like other books on a makeshift shelf, three years old, but better than nothing. He had needed them for one of his raids, and then no more, missing a telephoneline in his refuge. He filed them frantically. No Varinapam! Dammit! But he could have been a conference guest, too. Perhaps this woman knew more? She had used the magazin as wrapping paper, so she must have any connection with the university… and knew more about this conference, so he would get an anchor to start with his search for Varinapam. Westlake regretted to never have hijacked any internet access down here. He had feared this would allow his enemies to find him – but now it would have made things so much easier! Nonetheless, no time to worry about lost things! He had to act! This woman… Claire was her name, she had said. And he had checked her ID when he found her in the subway, just in case. It was a French sounding last name…Delaruelle? No… Remember, man!!! Yes… Deveraux! And she lived in the Bay Ridge area… Westlake reached for the phonebooks again. === Next day / Bay Ridge / Claire's home === Susanna, housekeeper of the Deveraux, was a middle aged woman with an agility betraying her round forms. At the moment, she had just finished her duties and was about to bring the garbage out, when a taxi cab stopped some meters away and a young man left the car. He headed straight into the direction of the Deveraux' mansion and Susanna watched out curiously. A boyfriend of the young lady, perhaps? Claire seemed far too reclusive, for Susanna's opinion anyway… \"Good morning, Ma'am. I'm looking for someone. Miss Claire Deveraux. Does she live here?\" But Susanna's sensibility for Claire's social life did not hinder her from being a little suspicious. Moreover, it was never good letting any would-be-boyfriends march along without the slightest obstacle! A truth she had inherited from her grandmother. So she answered slightly crispy: \"I'm not at liberty to answer any stranger showing up, Mister. Who are you?\" \"My name is Westlake. Dr. Westlake. From the University. I'm here because of a conference. It is very important that I speak to Miss Deveraux, please. She … knows me.\" \"Well, Mr. Westlake, I'm afraid you have to wait a while. Claire just went down to the library. If you want, I'll show you the guest room, and I can make you a tea.\" \"Thank you, very kind of you. I don't think I'll have the time, though. Perhaps I'll-\" \"Ah, wait! I see her car!\" Susanna interrupted him. \"Seems you are lucky!\" Claire parked and walked up to her parent's home with grumpy air. \"Imagine, library is closed because of a broken water-pipe!\" she called in Susanna's direction. A second later she recognized the man besides the housekeeper, as he turned around. Claire let nearly her bag drop on the pavement. Before she had put any reasonable sentence together, Susanna began to speak: \"That's destiny, Miss Claire. As you have a guest from the University, Dr. Westlake here, who has to talk to you!\" She smiled, and Claire did the same in order not to compromise anyone (and cause stress again with her parents) – and simply because this man had a gorgeous, heaven-melting smile himself. \"Ah… yes! How could I forget! I'm such an idiot! We are upstairs, then!\" Shortly the young woman wondered if her mother would be right and her 'guest' would grab the situation to do something nasty. But then she skipped the thought. It was ridiculous! He had had enough opportunities to take her hostage or anything else her mother was always afraid of. Shortly after, they sat in her room. \"So. Mister Westlake… you are from the University?\" Suddenly she felt really silly and mentally kicked herself in the buttock. But was it her fault he lingered around with the homeless?! Why hadn't he said who he was in the first place?! \"Not exactly from the Columbia, even if I studied there some years ago. I'm more an… independent scientist. Biocybernetics.\" \"Aha… uhm… and you work there in the underground?\" \"I have many light sensitive materials. And it is … good to hide.\" \"I understand! My Dad is in some super-secret weapon's research thingie, too. I'm sorry I thought you were a hobo! Have made an idiot out of myself because I brought you food and stuff, right?\" \"I appreciated your concern.\" His gaze wandered over the walls of her room and the bookshelfs. It felt … so STRANGE to be in a normal household again! Like any normal person! The windows… the curtains… the carpet… the pictures on the wall… \"….should I bring you something? A coffee?\" \"No, I have not much time, I'm sorry\", he answered, concentrating on the topic at hand. \"I came to know more about this event. This man.\" He shoved the two crampled pages from the university gazette over the table. \"We have similar research fields, and much to my regret I missed this conference. Was too … buried in my work.\" Claire took a look. \"A conference of the Medical Department… Hm… I'm from the artistic… I don't think I can help you with that. Perhaps my friend Jenna … her boyfriend studies medicine. But I cannot call her right now, she's in the Fitness Center, it is Monday.\" She read further. \"My God… artificial skin… sounds a little creepy…reminds me of these old monster movies!\" She raised her head again and was abashed by the expression in her guest's eyes. \"Sorry. Don't know why I said this. Just didn't think.\" Westlake looked away until his view rested on the fotograph of some statues by Raffael. \"No need to excuse. You are a student of art. You have to love beautiful things, not the contorted, wretched ones.\" Claire found he sounded very hurt, though. And she felt compelled to rectify: \"Not all artwork is what you would call beautiful. And… beauty is decaying rapidly. Paintings crack, statues break, you know. It's exactly the same. Like humans.\" \"Yes… beauty is such an elusive gift…\" He still stared at the fotograph. \"If you want to wait, I'm sure Jenna is at home around 1 PM.\" \"I can't stay. I'm sorry.\" He rose. A fast peek at his watch told him he only had approximately 60 minutes left. \"If this is because I just said these stupid things about your work – Of course, I know, many victims of accidents will be very grateful about this discovery.\" She pointed at the article. \"No. I have an urgent appointment. But if you could … try to figure out if Professor Varinapam is still in the city?\" \"Uh… yes…sure. Should I call you?\" \"I'll just drop by this evening; I'm in the area again, then. If this isn't bothering you.\" \"No, not at all!\" She didn't know why the prospect of seeing him again soon made her that happy, but it was the case.[Chapter 5] === New York / Bay Ridge / Claire's home === Claire had been waiting behind the window and observing the street for half an hour. When she finally discovered Westlake leaving a cab, she ran out. \"Hello, again!\" He looked serene and somewhat apprehensive, and Claire felt silly immedeately. This was not one of her friends, she reminded herself, and she should not act like a little girl! \"Good evening,\" he answered. \"I hope I have not disturbed you too much… You got any information about professor Varinapam, Miss Deveraux?\" \"Oh, no, you do not disturb! No prob! I was hanging around anyway. Vacations, you know… Concerning Varinapam: I called my friend. She said he left New York this morning for a conference in L.A. But he should be back in a week for a lecture at the Wellington Institute.\" She fumbled with her hair and was sure she looked awfully young! Jenna, she thought wryly, would have thrown all her beauty and charm into the way of this man, and surely she would've won the game, as she always did with the boys crossing her way! And when – \"This lecture, when will it take place?\" \"Next week, as far as I know.\" \"Next week…\" It was as if from one moment to another the sun shone into his face. Not only his lips smiled, his eyes too; his whole being seemed to radiate suddenly. \"That's … wonderful news, Miss Deveraux.\" How in God's name should he endure the waiting?! Now that the hope was back and the deliverance that close?! Life was within reach again, his own reach! Life was ready to grasp! One week… And he would finally step out of the darkness! The Darkman would DIE! … Getting your life back?! Don't fool yourself! It will be a patched-up life, no matter how you look like on the outside! And the blood on your hands will not vanish by it… \"… I said… uhm… idiotic things this morning,\" Claire's voice sounded again through his thoughts. \"About your work. So… what about an invitation for dinner, as a kind of reparation? I know a nice Greek restaurant over there.\" \"Why not? Sounds great to me\", Westlake answered before his rationality could kick in. He was hungry – not for food, but to catch a glimpse of normal life again, quasi as first rate of the awaited deliverance. Then he glanced at his watch. Hundred minutes left… \"I have not much time, though…\" Nonetheless, he followed her to a car parking nearby. \"That's mine\", Claire explained and padded the hood. \"Dad doesn't want me to use the subway anymore!\" She took place on the driver's seat, and Westlake next to her. === In the restaurant === It was a cozy little place with plants in little pots and replicas of Greek statues in niches. It was nothing special, and some people even would've said this was an example of bad taste. However Claire liked the place because of the oasis-feeling and because it had been here, where she had decided to study art, still a child then. For Peyton Westlake it was a trip to the normal life's past he had lost long ago. He savored everything, like a prisoner on shoreleave. The meal was delicious, even if it did not really matter to him, what exactly was on the plate. It was the whole ambiance that counted; the fact that he was sitting here on a table with white cloth and a candle in the center, talking about normal things… Not using the faked identity of some crime boss with the goal to destroy another evil network… No, a simple, normal dinner in a simple normal restaurant! Only now he realized how deprived of everything he really felt. \"…You find me boring to death, right?\" Claire said smiling. \"You did'nt say a word for the past 15 minutes at least! I'm sorry, you are a busy scientist, and I load all this nonsense stuff onto you. Guess this is the worst dinner invitation you ever had…\" \"No, it's very interesting. I just listened. You have a beautiful voice.\" She flushed. \"… and I liked to go in Art Galleries, when I was still… When I had still more time\", he finished. \"Some folks say, studying art and art history is something for the rich who have nothing else to do and who have not to bother with finding a job for a living later. Well… perhaps that's right. I don't know exactly what to do later…\" Claire grinned a little tortured. \"You must think I'm one of these unnerving High-Society chicks! I mean… you have a significant work. Helping people, being a doctor – it's something useful, not superfluous like art…\" \"I don't think art is superfluous\", he answered, his eyes half closed and lost in thoughts. \"Some people with whom I worked have lost everything… their old life, their face, their identity. Their relatives turn away or show nothing more than awkward mercy for the freak… while they silently wish he would die and spare them further meetings… These patients need someone explaining them how to find beauty in the world again. They need art more than a doctor giving them a new face, perhaps… Otherwise they do forget that there is not only pain in the world, but still simple things like… like this candle or this plant.\" Claire had listened and watched her companion in silence. A feeling crept through her, reminding her very much of the one she had while working in the Homeless-Kitchen. She felt sorry for the people in need and she sensed an urge to help, however did not know exactly how. \"Now I am the one who has destroyed a wonderful dinner invitation!\" Westlake ended his ponderings and forced himself back to the dessert and the wine on the table. \"I have to apologize.\" \"No. This was really… philosophical…I can understand, what you mean. It's like someone who has been blind and has to learn to see again.\" He nodded, but kept silence. Claire did not speak, too. But the silence was not of the uncomfortable sort. And a low, soft music perled through the room like a distant watercourse. The loud alarming beep of Westlake's watch disrupted the atmosphere in an instant. He stood up, that fast, that some other guests turned around. \"I'm sorry. I have to go! An urgent appointment.\" He took a hasty step towards the exit, but then stopped, holding a bunch of money in Claire's direction. \"Please take-\" \"Hey…It was MY invitation, remember? You don't have to pay anything! – Moreover, I can drive you, you don't have to call and wait for a taxi!\" \"No! I mean… it's okay. It is late already-\" The watch beeped again. \"Sounds urgent indeed! You don't work in the ER, do you?\" \"-I cannot expect you to drive me, Miss Deveraux! – I have to go now! I'm sorry! Thank you for this evening!\" With that, he was out of the door, running. === Same night / Bay Ridge / At home again === Claire had felt butterflies in her stomach the whole drive back to her parent's house. By the way she reached her room upstairs; the butterfly-colonie had grown into the one of the Tropical Institute. She threw her bag in the corner and let herself fall on the bed. She was in love, and it felt that good! She had to talk to someone! Right away! Otherwise she would burst! Her parents were at the theatre…so… Jumping up again she grabbed her celly to call Jenna. As expected, her girlfriend was pure hilarious excitement. \"Oh my! What?! … That's fantastic! Lucky one! Tell me, who is he? I wanna know everything!\" \"He is just… amazing…\" Claire replied and realized that she did not know very much and therefore had little to tell. \"He looks … what should I say… uh.. just great! Tall, lean, handsome… with a smile that could melt the polar caps, believe me! And he is polite, thoughtful, intelligent…\" \"Wow, that sounds really super-fantastic, Claire! I'm so happy for you! – Where did you meet your dream prince? Is he in your art history class? Where does he live?\" \"He works at the university,\" she answered and slipped into a lie easily: \"He lives at the Campus. There I met him, at the library…\" No, it felt not right to lie in this matter… Claire's joy gave place to a strange anxiety, and suddenly, she did not want to talk about it at all. \"Really?! Then I'm sure I've seen him yet!\" Jenna yelled in the phone. \"Don't know why a guy like THAT did not caught my attention, but, yeah, the opportunity was waiting for you, honey!\" She continued in her excitement and then stopped abruptly. \"Claire? What's up? You are so silent… Don't tell me… he is married, right? Aw… but… hey, that's not the end of the world, you know…\" Jenna began to unfold all her 'lifetime's experiences and wisdom'. Claire did only listen partially. I do not even KNOW where he lives, she thought, I do not know his phone number! And I do not know if I ever see him again! === In the underground === Westlake stopped his modified rail truck, when the computer announced some people crossing the tracks. He switched the lights off and waited, hidden behind the main panel. He could see the people now. They carried flashlights and one of them a suitcase. They were clad in black and camouflage clothes and did not have the air of poor hobos. For now, Westlake did not care. Almost certainly they were some kind of criminals, but they were far from his perimeters. He would not bother them as long as they did not bother him! Soon, he would've left this place… One week… How should he contact Varinapam? He could not simply show up at the university… Well, he'd find a solution! And then… He would combine his research results with the ones of the professor. They would get stable samples of useful size, not on a microscopic scale! He remembered the promising results got 8 years ago in the lab of this damned traitor… Only after some hours! And now… within a month or two, he would perhaps have back his face! The Darkman ignored the warning voice in his head not to become too confident. Hope was such an amazing thing! He did not want to loose it again; he clung onto it this time, knowing if hope left him again, nothing would be worth to live for anymore… … The four men sneaking through the underground had passed the tunnel. Suddenly, one of them stopped in his tracks. \"What's up?\" \"Thought I'd seen somethin'…\" \"It's a service truck, moron!\" \"Somethin' movin' inside…\" \"Rats, what else! Stray cats! Move your ass, man, or do you wanna stare into the tunnel the whole night?!\" They walked further, until one of them asked: \"So, what's with the plan?\" \"The Boss gave his okay. We'll get this fuckin' bastard and drill the information out of his brain.\" Roaring laughter followed. \"Some action, finally! Was getting sick of this screen monitoring!\" \"When is D-day?\" \"Next weekend. We get'em on his way home, on the passage to the park. Nice lovely spot for a lil' kidnapping!\" … Westlake worked the whole night browsing through his papers and data disks, untouched for over a year now. He assorted everything, compiled singular files and copied them, put papers together and wrote anew, what was illegible because of dirt and dampness. He did not feel any exhaustion, now that he had something to work for, the rushes of Adrenalin were a very welcomed help. In the darkness of the underground, he did not notice the daybreak. Only Jerky's barking and the cat's more and more urgent meows made clear it was time to feed his furry companions. When they sat satisfied in front of their bowls, the man continued his work. Somewhere among the loose papers a picture caught his attention. Julie… Cautiously, he cleaned the surface of the photo from the dust and regarded it. Julie. In resting, tiredness slowly crept up in him. He closed his eyes. This young woman, Claire Deveraux… something in her reminded him of Julie. The way she tilted her head … her look... He could not quite pinpoint it. The photo in his hand, Peyton Westlake fell asleep. In his dreams, the faces of Julie and Claire flew into one another. For the first time he did not wake up screaming, when the sequence came where he tried to follow Julie and could not reach her anymore. This time he saw himself just standing in the door and watching darkness fell. === Bay Ridge / Claire's home === \"It CAN'T be,\" she said aloud and rubbed her eyes. She was staring at the computer screen for hours, and outside the first sunrays penetrated the cloud layer. It had been impossible to find any sleep last night, especially after the talk with Jenna, who had stirred up all kinds of sinister theories. The butterflies in her stomach were still there – a thought of his face or the recall of his voice was enough to set them in swirling motion again. But there was this other uneasy feeling now… Was he married or was something else \"wrong\" with him? She could not be that lucky to find such a fairytale-prince, right?! Claire decided to let a Google search run with his name and/or his research field. First, to prove her dark thoughts wrong. Second, simply out of curiosity. And now she was staring at the Google output. There had been some articles in medical newspapers, all ten years old and more; some notifications and citations, conference programs. And then, there was this: '…we deeply mourn the loss of our appreciated colleague Dr. Peyton Westlake… 5 th of March, 1995…' The press announcement was accompanied by the photo of a funeral and some people standing in a laboratory, around Westlake himself. Claire found more condolences and news, saying all the same. Peyton Westlake had died 10 years ago in an awful accident in his laboratory. The whole building blew up then. No one had found his body, though. But after such an explosion, no one COULD have found it, Claire added. Or…what? Insurance fraud? No, this didn't make any sense. People doing such things did not spend their life in the New York underground with scientific work – they vanished to South America or on a yacht to Asia! What was going on here? She switched the computer off, let herself fall back on the bed and tried to think. The puzzle pieces of this man she knew so far would not fit together. Perhaps it is good I have not his phone number and do not know where he lives , she mused while slowly dozing off. He made no steps showing me he would be interested the slightest in seeing me again… and so I won't… But fate decided otherwise. === Two days later / Central New York / Near the library === Claire had been on her way back from the library, where she had tried to get other things in her mind and to prepare for her master studies. And to avoid her mother's idea of inviting the 'nice and promising' son of one of her beauty salon girlfriends. Anna Deveraux had obviously picked up this guy as future son-in-law, even if until now Claire had been absolutely not worth a look for him! Well, she wasn't interested in this young banker with the stylish blonde haircut, anyway! Her thoughts rested again on her mysterious new acquaintance, and she marched faster, a little angry about life and fairy-tale-princes in particular. It had started snowing. Until she had reached her parking lot, it snowed that heavy, she could barely see anything. Next corner she collided with another pedestrian. She grabbed her bag firmer (in case it was a pickpocket), then opened her mouth for an excuse. The words never left her, because she looked in Peyton Westlake's face. \"Ah… well… hello! Uh… had not thought to… run into you… what a coincidence…\" She laughed and hoped not to sound too confused and silly. Her mind raced past signs with \"he's supposed to be DEAD!\" written on them and \"just say hello and WALK by\". Her feet rested on the street. \"A happy coincidence, Miss Deveraux,\" he said. \"After I had to leave so fast last time. Did not even say Good-bye.\" \"Yes…uhm… this doesn't matter. I mean, I know, you are quite busy.\" She found that it didn't bother her at the moment to talk with a supposedly dead person. She was happy herself, despite all the 'warning signs'. It simply felt too good to be in his presence again! She would think about the other things later… surely there was a rational explanation. One not including ghosts, vampires and all those things! She was only too blind to see it now. \"So… you were over there in the electronics store, right? Needed some stuff for your research?\" \"Yes. One of the devices… did not function properly anymore.\" (He had kicked it off the table months ago, and it was broken since). \"You are still working down there?\" Claire asked. \"Is it not too cold by now?\" \"No, if you are in the right spots, it's warm and comfortable.\" \"Sounds as if you speak of your home! … You practically live there, do you?\" She was not sure if she really wanted to lure any information out of him or not. She just asked and hoped not to get any \"bad\" answer. She did not want to run and never see him again! \"I have… much work… very much work. And some things I would like to finish before I meet Professor Varinapam.\" They started walking together down the road. \"You ARE too buried in your work!\" Buried… She had to find out about this \"being dead\"-problem, somehow… He was hiding, in the underground, or with bandages on his face like she had seen in the soup kitchen. But hiding from whom? Why couldn't she fall in love with normal guys like Jenna did?! He had stopped, watching some snowflakes melting on his glove and Claire did the same – mainly in order not to stare at him. \"When I was a kid, one of my cousins told me a story about children getting lost in a snowstorm and being kidnapped by an evil elf prince who brought them in his underground palace. I was so afraid after this; I did not want to go out when it was snowing, that year!\" Claire remembered. Westlake turned his head with a strange look in his eyes, haunted and hurt. \"Real monsters do not live in the underground\", he said. \"They are in the sun, next to us, ready to destroy other's life. And some monsters are… right inside us and doing even better work of destruction.\" She wanted to say something, but before she could speak, he smiled again and continued. \"Funny, these childhood stories, aren't they? However, the underground palace does exist! Shall I show you?\" === In the underground === Claire could not explain herself, why she followed him down; in the subway first, then through a service area, where he blindfolded her. She said to herself, she SHOULD be afraid – nonetheless she was not, only excited because something dark and mysterious, but wonderful, was waiting ahead. Not even the fact that she couldn't see anything anymore frightened her. She felt that safe beside him, sensing the warmth of his body through the fabric of the coat. She trusted him and silenced every other voice in her head. Peyton Westlake silenced the drilling warning voices in his mind the same. The past days after he got the information Varinapam would be back in a week, he had been filled with energy and excitement. He could barely find sleep. He did not want to be alone, without human companionship now. His mind was too close to instability. He needed someone to talk, something for diversion. At least – he glanced at his watch – for the 50 minutes he still had time! 50 minutes left of the illusion of a normal life! Three days until the professor's scheduled return… \"We have arrived – but don't look yet. I have to procure more light!\" Claire rested where she was, her heart hammering. She could hear some strange sounds, the sizzling noise of electricity. And the air smelled slightly of burned plastic and ozone. \"Now look! The underground palace! Could need some cleaning… but…\" She was speechless in surprise. They stood in a large hall, she discovered now. The walls were covered with glazed ceramic tiles, with bands of floral ornaments. The orange and yellow color glinted like gold in the light. Above, a Victorian style glass roof, now partly broken and covered with earth and debris. Some chandeliers were still up. The place looked lost in time, like a sunken ship. \"Where ARE we?\" Claire finally managed. \"It's the old City Hall Station, closed since 1945.\" \"This is… this is unbelievable… I didn't know about it!\" She turned round and round and felt exactly like an archeologist who has found something gorgeous beneath the dirt of the ground! \"Nearly no one knows. This is my … private enchanted palace.\" \"Let's dance! This is the right place for it!\" Claire stretched her hand and started humming a waltz. \"I don't think I am a very good dancer,\" Westlake answered, and for once the warning voice got through. \"Oh, me the same. My teacher always says I move like a farmer's girl in hay dance! But… no one is watching us here!\" He pushed the warnings back again and took Claire's hand. 40 minutes left, until the elf prince would change into a demon again. 40 minutes wonderful illusion and another advance payment of the awaited deliverance… (With this scene of them dancing through the old City Hall Station, I leave you until the next update! I assure my readers, it will not go on as soapy as it is now^^. Pictures of the station can be found at the internet easily – and sometimes, there are tourist tours!)[Chapter 6] === New York underground / Old City Hall station === It was silent. The two people stood underneath one of the remaining glass domes, arms folded around each other. Motionless, enchanted in an unreal place. Westlake desperately wished to touch this woman without gloves, to caress her hair… explore, how it would feel to sense her… how much would and could he feel again? Claire held him; it seemed she was afraid of moving because it would break the spell. He found her incredibly beautiful and appealing. He longed to sense her. How would it be like…? She had her eyes closed, and her mouth was an alluring, sweetness-promising fruit. How would it feel…? Westlake felt himself bowing his head to reach her. Their lips nearly touched…. What are you doing?! Stop this! Are you out of your mind?! Rationality snapped back with the utmost brutality. \"You have to go!\" he commanded, still fighting to get the ground back under his feet. His heart raced, his whole body hurt from the effort just to push her back. Claire's mind was still hovering in the fairy-tale-realm. \"Why?\" she answered playfully. \"Because the prince will turn into a monster every minute and keep me prisoner in his castle?\" \"You have to go, I said!\" He was angry at himself. Which devil had possessed him to take this woman to this place?! What did he think, for heaven's sake?! Did he loose his self control in this matter now as he did on other occasions?! Claire looked at him, uncertain how to react and surprised about the sudden change of mood. A thousand things burst into her thoughts, like 'now he's getting cold feet because of his wife, just as Jenna said'. She wanted to say something at least, something friendly, uncompromising – nothing had happened, in fact, so there was nothing to be sorry about! However, before she found words, the alarm of his watch echoed through the underground hall. His expression changed once more. She saw a glimpse of naked panic in his eyes. \"Come! We have to hurry! I take you to the next subway station!\" Westlake grabbed her hand and dragged her along to the narrow path upstairs. \"Hurry, please!\" It sounded as if a horde of ready-to-kill-vampires was right behind them. Claire attempted to collect her thoughts, but was not able to do so. His now quite obvious fear settled into her, too. What was going on here? Going on with him?! She did not dare to ask, she had to watch her feet. The old iron staircase cracked. He lifted Claire up the next steps, and then nearly carried her through the following muddy passage. A train could be heard in the distance. \"If this is because you are married, I –\" \"Don't turn around! Just walk! Hurry!\" They left the service tunnel running. He held her tightly at her shoulders, preventing her from slipping on the wet ground, but also from turning back and facing him. Finally, they had reached the last graffiti-sprayed door. \"You only have to go through and down on the other side.\" Claire's fingers closed around the door grip. \"Go! Nothing will happen. The station is on the other side!\" A faint click behind her, and the lights went out. Claire felt seduced to turn around, to catch a last view of Westlake or say a word, but she did not. She wanted to get out of the darkness as soon as possible. So she pushed the door open, stepped through. Only a moment before it slammed shut again, she swirled around, stared back. Peyton Westlake was gone. This time, she was sure never to see him again… === Next Day / Bay Ridge / Claire 's home === \"No, I don't wanna come to Kara's party, I told you!\" Claire was ready to simply hang up the phone. Jenna unnerved her. Parties unnerved her. Everything unnerved her! \"But why? You wanted all those weeks! You'll see it will be fun, honey! Lissa just called me and said her cousin will be there, too! The one from the Air-Force, remember? You always had a crush on him, hadn't you?\" \"I don't wanna come. I can't. I… do not feel… too good. Think I might come down with something…. I have to finish now, sorry. Call you tomorrow. Bye!\" Claire was cross with herself. She repeated in her mind, she hadn't 'lost' anyone, because this man hadn't been her boyfriend in the first place! Heavens, she would not even know his forename, if not from her internet search! He had shown her this spooky place underground, ok. He was a little weird, like all those guys who were buried in their work or computer stuff too much. He was officially dead! He had odd habits! He was not interesting AT ALL! Why couldn't she listen to herself?! And the butterflies in her stomach did not want to leave either. They were stubborn little creatures! The young woman sighed, and then decided to go down and watch a little TV. Her father was at home in his office, working on a 'sensitive secret project' – obviously 'sensitive, secret projects' were something men cherished like toys! She sat down and grabbed the remote control. Not exactly in a mood to concentrate her thoughts on anything else than Peyton Westlake, she zapped through the channels. On CNN there were pictures of a plane crash, and she stopped to hear where the accident had happened. A minute later she held her breath. '… on board was also Dr. Ravi Varinapam, Nobel-Prize-winner in medicine and biomechanics, with whom we talked only yesterday in our feature ….' Shit… Claire couldn't believe her ears. No survivors of the crash? … And Peyton had already looked forward to the meeting with Varinapam that much! What would he do, if he got the news? Her first impulse was to call him, until she remembered she had no number to call. === In the underground === The computer monitor went into pieces, when Westlake threw it down on the pile of other broken equipment. Disks and papers and glass tubes, with bloody spots on them from his already bleeding hands. For now, rage made him senseless again. His world had stopped spinning the moment he had heard the news of the crash in the radio. It had stopped. His hopes, his life, his future, forever! It had stopped and shrunk to the dangerous nucleus of a black hole of desperation, and then it exploded. Blind from tears, he stumbled across something. With a roar, he grabbed the next thing his fingers could reach and smashed it against some storage containers. Electricity sparkled. In the distance, Westlake heard Jerky barking, but this was a sound from another world, one in which he did not belong anymore. The sizzling electricity however, was quite real. He struggled to his feet, reached out for the loose cable in front of him. The Darkman would die! The one way or the other! But this time, his body betrayed him. The electricity shot through him in a pain which was more he could handle. He winced back instinctively; his mind was not strong enough to force him. He fell against the containers and hit the ground together with the rusty metal boxes. The little bit what left of his world, was darkness and pain. === Two days later === Claire had been to the university in the secret hope to meet Westlake there, exchanging condolences with colleagues and students of Varinapam. Nearly the whole day she was there, in and around the Medical Department. She crossed the path of Jenna's brother; that was all. Of course, she reprimanded herself, now back in her car, with a head dizzy from too much talking. Of course he was not there! For he was supposed to be dead as well!!! Later the day, a nagging feeling started to settle in. She tried to ignore it, let the rest of the evening pass, a sleepless night and half of the next day. However, the feeling grew and bothered her more and more. Something was not right. Something awful was going on! She could not name it, but it was there. Her mother would say she was imagining things and that she badly needed psychological help! When Jenna called, Claire agreed to an evening in the cinema. And now she was sitting in the chair, fidgety moving back and forth. She had no clue what this movie was about. Some stupid guy and a red haired hysteric woman chasing one another – so what was the point? How could Jenna find this amusing?! The weird feeling still tugged. Claire held out another twenty minutes, and then she excused with headache and was on her way out. It was about ten P.M. when she arrived at home. Only some minutes later she sneaked out again, with the direction subway underground. She refused thinking about possibilities and dangers right now. She knew if she began thinking, she would probably run back. And the feeling in her said, she would regret it for the rest of her life, if she did so. ===In the underground === Claire found the way back into the underground she had used last time without difficulties, even though the encounter with a drunkard right before the entrance still sent shivers over her. Now it was quiet; her feet made the only sound. After the situation outside she felt nearly safe here. It was damned cold! Her breath formed white clouds, and the light cone of her Maglite danced over ice-covered walls. How could anyone still work down here , she wondered. She recognized the graffiti on the old brick wall and knew she had to turn right, then down the steps. This was the place, where she had met the cat last time…the cat with her pendant on the collar. This time, nothing welcomed her from the darkness and silence in front of her. She stepped further, and her bad feeling was nearly overwhelming by now. Already she had reached the spot where she had put down her backpack. In the flickering, orange light of an old lamp on the ceiling she could discern the disorder here, totally different from the last look into this realm. Her feet crushed shards and other debris. Somewhere a dog whined. Peyton's dog? Had someone attacked him and destroyed the lab? She had heard of harsh concurrence among scientists; the one or the other might have chosen desperate measures to get an envied colleague out of his way… Or maybe this chaos was the result of some junkies out for trouble and destruction… a youth gang… She walked further, calling his name. No answer. She sensed a lump in her stomach. O God, I won't find anything very, very bad…will I? She trembled. The dog barked and whined again. The next moment Claire discovered the figure stretched out on the ground some meters in front of her. She bent down, feeling very sick suddenly. \"Peyton?\" The shine of her flashlight wandered over his chest; he seemed to breathe at least. A second later, Claire froze in shock and nearly let her Maglite drop. Was this man Westlake at all?! Yes, he wore the same cloths. She stared at the horrible remnants of a face below her for what seemed an eternity. The pieces of the puzzle fit together, all of a sudden. She understood… and decided that this knowledge was nothing that mattered. What her eyes saw, was not important. Never this was important! Hastily, she crouched down, tried to lift him up. He was that cold! She peeled off her furry winter jacket and wrapped it around his shoulders. \"Peyton? Wake up! Wake up!!! … Shit!\" She wondered, if her celly would work down here and she could call 911. What if he did not wake up? She could not carry him! Then she fumbled after the bottle with water she had taken along in the backpack. Cold water was certainly not the best choice in his condition, but perhaps it would wake him at least! Claire emptied the bottle over his head. It worked. Coughing, Westlake regained consciousness. He blinked and discovered the woman at his side. She saw anger, pain and then simple exhaustion sweep through his eyes, before he fell back again. \"So… 'inally… you see the… 'onster o' the underground…\" She shove the backpack under his head. \"What happened here? Who did this? Have you seen anyone to report to the police?\" \"'aht ha'ened? Tried to 'inish… 'hat these 'astards started ten years ago…\" A short bitter laughter let creep coldness over Claire. \"Not quite… success'ul…\" \"What are you talking about? … Stay down, I don't know-\" He pushed her back, got to his feet, but his legs gave way again and he sunk back to his knees with an angry growl. \"Go a'ay! 'lease… go…just GO!\" He felt tears burn in his eyes. She should not see him that way, and yet she was there and stared and did not turn. \"Go! It's o'er! E'erything… is O'ER!\" \"Listen… Peyton. I know these were bad news… the plane crash and so on…\" Claire did not exactly know what to say. This man was so completely different from the one she had known so far! However, she cared deeply, and she wanted to help. \"But… but this is not the end! Don't give up hope yet! You can-\" \"I did not gi' u' ho' 'or ten years!\" Westlake wanted to shout this at her, at the whole world, but felt too weak. Jerky twined around him. He did not notice it. \"All I got were insta'le sam'les… useless!\" \"Varinapam may be dead, but… his research is not. It is all there at the university. You can work on this base…\" \"Yes!\" The ugly laughter again. \"I just 'alk in there and take 'lace at his desk!\" Claire put a hand on his back. \"Please…\" \"Go. I don't need your acts o' charity. 'etter donate the' to the ones in the ho'less' kitchen!\" Nevertheless, he couldn't hush away the young woman that easily. And did he want to at all? He did not dare to ask himself this question. His mind was a huge, black hole of pain. \"Why are you hiding? Why … didn't you get any help in a hospital after the accident?\" Claire wanted to know. \"Oh I got! I lost 'my 'ace, and they took a'way the a'ility to 'eel any sensations! Great hel'! They created a senseless 'reak! 'wonderful human lab rat to 'lay with! \" He slammed his right hand onto the desk, forgetting the cuts in the palm and let out a cry of disgust. \"But now you can feel again…\" Claire took his hand, careful like something precious. \"So it starts to get better?\" It 's an even worse curse , he thought. \"Go, 'lease. You can't understand. Lea'e 'e alone.\" \"Are you kidding? I can't leave you here alone in this mess! You need medical attention! Come on, I get you into a hospital; I take care you get the best treatment available! Down here in this cold you will die! The weather forecast said it would be another 10 more minus the next days!\" She heard the dog sniffing next to her and added: \"And I take care of your pets!\" \"No. Go and … ne'er co' here again, Claire.\" She stood there without moving, and he could not summon enough strength to simply pass her and go alone. \"Ha'e a shelter in one o' the old trains,\" Westlake continued. \"And an electric heater. Just… hel' … o'er there.\" The young woman was not sure she had understood the words correctly. Nonetheless, she could not force him to come with her. So at least she would see to it he did not stay in the cold without care. Therefore she nodded and helped him up. Indeed, there was a place in an abandoned wagon, with a mattress and blankets and more storage containers. She discovered the electric heater, too. It was one of the newest models, a thing she found reassuring, normally not putting too much trust in these 'fire starters'. However, she turned him a deaf ear concerning renewed pleas to leave. She could not do this. She simply could not! She had to stay and look after him, at least until tomorrow, until she knew he was in a stable condition. This decision let another problem pop up, and a huge one! Grabbing her celly, Claire went out of the wagon. It was worth a try! The provider said it should work in subway tunnels… Well… She dialled Jenna's number. Her girlfriend was up and in a good mood, even if it was already 2 o'clock A.M. \"Claire? Is that you?\" she yelled. \"Can barely hear your! Where are you? What's up?\" \"Jenna, I need a favour…\" \"Of course, that's what friends are for! So what is it?\" \"I'm here… uhm… I mean, I won't go home this night, and I'm afraid my parents discover it and worry. You know them. And then they'll call you first. So I thought you could just say I'm with you and I will show up at home in the morning? Please, it's important!\" \"Wow! Don't tell me! You are with HIM, aren't you?! Of course I calm your parents! Hey, hon, this is so great! Where are you two hiding? You sound like calling from New Zealand!\" \"I'm in a… sort of cottage… in the countryside. And I'm afraid my battery is nearly exhausted, I have to stop now!\" \"'Course. Don't think about your parents! I'll manage them!\" Jenna made a kiss through the phone and Claire breathed a sigh of relief. Should she think whatever she wanted! Then she went back inside. Westlake sat on his sleeping place. The grey cat had made herself comfortable besides him, and he caressed her. Only the heater and the one old lamp outside on the tunnel's ceiling provided some light. Enough for her to see he cried. She wished, a wizard would show up and she really could be in a nice cottage with the charming prince from the first encounter. A moment later Claire realized she was hungry and thirsty and freezing, despite the heater. Something hot to drink would be good, not only for her 'patient'… She asked for the possibility to make a tea or something and felt silly. It sounded as if she was on a camping trip! This whole situation was absurd! \"Outside. In the alu-container.\" He had given up saying she should leave. Claire found not only a little cooking device running on propane, but all sorts of cans and food packages. No wonder he enjoyed the visit in the restaurant that much , she thought, while arranging what seemed useful to her. Dog- and cat food was there too. Already, she was surrounded by Jerky and four cats, which followed every movement until she had their meals ready. She wasn't exactly a good cook – in fact she had never set foot in the kitchen, except for talking to the housekeeper. So her mix of instant noodles and corned-beef was perhaps a little adventurous. She did not care for now, because it smelled good. … Claire cowered on a pillow on the floor of the old subway compartment. They had eaten in silence. Perhaps Westlake had thought she would only comprehend a tiny bit of what he said anyway. She did not know. But she would've preferred talking to get the dark musings out of his mind and the apprehension out of hers. And she liked to hear his voice even though. The young woman turned her head towards the mattress where he slept, the grey cat on his legs. She probed for the butterflies in her, which had embarrassed her that much the past one and a half weeks. They weren't gone, but they were not as agitated as before. It felt as if they had settled down, and the battering of their wings had created a warming fire in her. A fire of pity and charity, she asked herself, reminding Peyton's words. Maybe. Claire had no possibility of comparison. However, it felt not that bad. She went over to him and lay down at his side. In an instant, she was asleep, too. … Julie! WAIT! Why did this dream invade him again?! Why didn't this stop?! The fight against the illusion was as useless as ever. The events enrolled. Nothing could stop this. The very next moment Julie's silhouette would just vanish in the darkness as always before… No. The dream was not as it used to be! Julie was not gone. She turned around… and she was not Julie anymore, but Claire. She walked… back to him, embraced him. The palpability of the touch let him wake up immediately. Above him was the familiar structure of the old wagon's roof. Nothing but a dream. No, the warmth of a body next to him was still there, was real. He barely dared to turn his head, afraid even this would manifest itself as an illusion of his tortured mind. The feeling and the sight did not vanish. Gently, he put his arm around her. He did not want to hope again. Not the slightest drop of hope should fall into his heart, he swore. Only a little moment of peace, of dream, of illusion once more. A short escape.[Chapter 7] === In the New York underground === Peyton Westlake stepped through the shards of his laboratory and through the ruins of his life. His fingers slid over the broken surface of a picture frame. The photo below was scratched as well, Julie's beautiful face destroyed like his own. Everything was destroyed… He had to go; far away from all these lost hopes! He would never get stable samples; perhaps it was simply not possible! Despite everything he tried, it would not happen! And Varinapam, the last chance, was dead. Westlake cut off the memory of Claire's suggestion about remaining search results at the university and the possibility of continuing his work. It WOULD not happen. He could not go back. He had looked far too long into the darkness, into the abyss, and it had claimed too much of him. He did not WANT to hope. He would not even think about this subject anymore! It was over! He had to leave all this behind and go and – and do what? Searching a new purpose in life? A new job, a nice home in the green suburbs?! You are a pathetic idiot!!! The only thing you can do is suit yourself in the life of a homeless, at the marge of the society! He sat down on one of the overthrown containers. A life in misery and darkness… till the end. To end it himself, he was not ready; at the moment at least his rational mind was prevailing. Still he was a scientist, a doctor, not a madman… not most of the time… Westlake smiled sadly. His hand closed around a blue, Indian-style silk scarf, which had been on the ground. Claire must have lost it when she left this morning. He sighed and closed his eyes. The solitude had always been a burden since he had confined himself to this existence. He had loved to work with other people, to find solutions for a problem in combined effort. And he had loved to go to concerts, into theatre… Yes, the loneliness was the heaviest of all chains bonding him. Claire had been here for only some hours, and yet he felt like a prisoner thrown even deeper into the pit after she was gone. He hadn't slept a minute after he had put the arm around her last night. Too precious was every moment of this last illusion of normality and the warmth of another human being close to him… He had to leave this place indeed. To leave and forget HER! Otherwise he would go mad for sure. === Bay Ridge / Jenna's home === Claire sneaked into the estate of her girlfriend through the garden door, after Jenna had deactivated the alarm system. Her parents owned a huge mansion here, and contrarily to herself, they left her daughter quite a lot of liberties. Jenna looked tired. She had been to a club after the cinema, this she confessed yawning while the two young women took place on the couch in her apartment. Nonetheless, she was curious to hear the news from her friend! \"Tell me, how it went? I'm DYING for curiosity!\" \"I love him,\" Claire said plainly without even bringing her mind into action. The words came by themselves. Only then her rationality stepped in. What did I just say?! She sighed and let her head fall into her hands. \"O great! But… you spread the aura of being on a funeral! What's wrong, honey? Hey…\" Jenna padded her back. \"You can tell me, you know! He has to divorce first? He does not mean serious business?\" \"No… It's complicated… more complicated, I mean.\" She did not want to lie, but she felt not up to tell the truth either. There was too much chaos in her right now. \"Did my mother call?\" she asked to change the topic. \"Yep. Told her you were sleeping here. When do your oldies finally realize that you are grown up?! – I'm alone all weekend, by the way. My parents went to Las Vegas last night, for the show of this… uhm… I forgot; doesn't interest me anyway! The important thing is I have my peace and quiet in the whole house! If you want, you can come over this afternoon again.\" \"Maybe…\" \"You really need a little cheer-up! But first, some breakfast!\" === Later the day / Claire's home === \"I've invited Carlton for your birthday party… Claire, darling? What do you say?\" Her mother, busy arranging some flowers on the dinner table, turned around. What should she say? That she hated it when her mother invited guests for HER party? That she found parents nauseating who named their son 'Carlton' and that she knew Carlton had no interest in her – and she had no interest in him? She managed a surprised smile and an \"Oh, that's so nice of you! Thank you!\" nonetheless. Her thoughts circled around another problem. Mom, I met someone, who is really charming and cultivated; he just needs our help for the moment – No, her mother would think she was fallen prey to a con artist or other imposter out for her money! This wouldn't work… What about the truth? Meaning I have to admit I was down in the sewer again, and after that mother won't listen to anything! … Mom, do you remember the feature about this Nobel-Prize winner and his research?... The expensive glass bowl Claire had carried shattered on the ground. \"Heavens, Darling! What's wrong with you today? It's the second thing you smashed! You didn't drink anything or take any drugs yesterday with Jenna, did you?\" \"No, I assure you. I'm just a little tired, it's nothing!\" I will never be able to tell her; I can't find a start! While Susanna the housekeeper arrived to clean the floor from the shards, Claire went out into the garden for new flowers. She needed to be alone; if possible she would've enclosed herself in her room! Or better, gone back into the underground and see if Peyton was alright. I should not have left him there alone in the first place! I should have called help; a doctor, or the police or preferably both! Her thoughts wandered further and she had forgotten the flowers. Maybe she should just call someone at the University, at the Medical Department; someone from the staff of Professor Varinapam? Just to test the area a bit. She did not know for sure, who was responsible for the attack on Westlake 10 years ago. He had talked as if it had been initiated by organized crime, and then again it had sounded like an act of revenge… He had been elusive… and she had to be careful with information concerning him in any case. … Another two hours of torturing small talk with her mother and birthday preparations went by, and then Claire was finally alone in her room. As decided, she searched a phone number from Varinapam's staff, then gathered her courage and called a certain Dr. Reinitzer…. \"Hello… my name is Ellen Parker,\" she lied and hoped to sound unsuspicious. \"I'm writing an article for my college newspaper. About modern medicine and prosthetics and help for accident victims. Do you have 15 minutes for me, Doctor?\" \"Yes, sure. Just ask.\" His accent was horrible, but at least he had not hushed her away! She let him explain the aims and work flow and talk extensively about the funding problems, until she thought the time right to ask: \"Will the project continue, now that Professor Varinapam died? Do you have any successor yet?\" \"Sadly, we have none in our staff who could manage the working load Ravi put on himself. And he was quite reclusive, almost a solitaire. Anyone who takes over will have a rough time only in assorting all papers, I suppose…\" He cleared his throat. \"Well, he was a genius! The Dean will advise with the deputies from the department tomorrow. I can't say anything more specific, I'm sorry Miss Parker. But if we are lucky, we'll get a scientist from Switzerland to take the lead. If the funding is not cut.\" Aw! The one able to bring forward this project is right here in New York! \"Aha… Uhm… Dr. Reinitzer, somewhere I read something about a certain Dr. Westlake?\" She played dumb schoolgirl. \"Oh, yes. Peyton Westlake. We worked together as assistants. Was a sort of workaholic, but nice. Unfortunately he died some years ago in an awful incident. – It's sounding like a conspiracy theory! Every time our team reaches a breakthrough point, the team leader dies… Well, of course, this is non-scientific nonsense, Miss Parker.\" \"Is it your opinion that Westlake would have been able to continue the research?\" \"Maybe. But it is superfluous talking about the possibility, because he is dead.\" \"Of course… Thank you, Dr. Reinitzer! I think I have enough material to write my article now.\" She hung up and lay back on the bed. I HAVE to get Peyton out of this underground hideout and BACK to the university! … The hysteric cry of her mother let Claire jump up. She ran out, down the stairs, and found her standing next to the phone, trembling and in tears of shock. \"Mom, what's going on?\" \"They… they have kidnapped Frank… oh my God, what shall I do?\" Anna Deveraux clutched her hands around the armchair. \"What shall I do?!\" \"Dad? Kidnapped Dad?\" Claire repeated. \"Who, Mom?\" \"Don't know… some…terrorists… They want the schematics for this new… I don't know! Of whatever he just worked on, he did not tell me in detail! They want the schematics and 2 million Dollars or they'll KILL HIM!\" She fumbled after tranquillizers in the side board. Claire still could not believe this. \"Maybe… it is some kind of bad joke? Did you call the police?\" \"No, they warned me if I do so, they'll do some nasty things with Frank… O my God…\" Before Claire could answer, a beeping sound from the adjacent room pierced the air. Frank Deveraux' Email-Notification. \"Shut this thing off!\" Anna shouted and swallowed some pills. Claire ran into the working room of her father, something she had done not very often, because he preferred to stay alone there. The letter symbol blinked on the screen, in unison with the alarm sound. When the young woman touched the mouse for deactivating the notification, the mail opened – and a video sequence filled the screen. Even before she could discern anything or think anything, the slightly blurred voice of her father sounded from the speakers. In an instant, Anna Deveraux was besides her daughter and stared at the video. Now they saw some people emerging from the grey-black background, clad half in military wear and with black masks in front of the faces. Two of them held Frank Deveraux, bleeding from a wound at his head. No, they did not seem to be from the patient sort…. The panic of her mother began to grab Claire as well. The phone rang again. Claire took the call, because her mother did not move. \"It's them… They said … said they have sent an Email to Dad's account, and … it's all. They've quit the line!\" '…Look very careful, Mrs. Deveraux!' the order from the video sounded chilly through the room. 'You see we're not in a playful mood…' another blow hit the prisoner. Then the kidnapper opened a door and shoved Frank Deveraux inside a small room. 'Await our instructions! And I repeat, do NOT involve the police or any other officials!' Claire frowned. She had seen these kinds of doors and vaults! These people had to be down in the underground tunnels somewhere! \"Stop!\" she whispered and hit the \"halt\"-button herself, only to rewind and repeat in slow motion. \"What are you doing?\" her mother asked exhausted. \"I have… I think I have seen something…\" \"What in hell could you see, except the barbaric behavior of these… these CRIMINALS!\" She did not answer. She needed all her effort to pull herself together, to concentrate. Yes… there it was; she had not been mistaken! Shortly a worn out number over the door appeared. 42. \"I know someone who could help, Mom!\" Claire said, and speaking this, the idea gained strength. \"I know someone who could find the place where they hold Dad prisoner! Then the police could –\" \"What are you talking about? Don't make me crazy, Claire! – Wait! Where do you think you go?!\" \"I told you, I get help!\" She was already out of the door. \"Claire? Darling, don't do anything stupid! Claire! You can't go and leave me here alone! Claire!!!\" \"I call you, Mom! Trust me!\" ===In the underground === Westlake caught himself pleading and arguing against his own mind, to find an excuse to see Claire again. A last time, only once. Hold her one last time, out in the open, in the Park perhaps, amongst the falling snow – just as any normal man. What could be wrong, what could GO wrong? His heart was begging and undermining his determination to leave like a river a stone barrier. A last time, then it would be over forever. He promised this to the shadowy silhouette of his rationality. One last favor, he begged. Please… Still he had one of his artificial skins in storage, just enough for this last tiny escape. More was not possible anyway, because he had destroyed his equipment. In the afternoon he was ready to go. He closed his coat, took a last view of the flawless, handsome face shown in the shards of the mirror and smiled. A Good-bye-smile to himself. But he would stall the inevitable for another 120 minutes! 120! He had to hurry and find Claire! Westlake had reached his railway truck, when the alarm went on. He cursed. He had no time for that now! However – it didn't matter anymore anyway. Nothing was left here worth anything, only destruction. He shut the alarm system down and went back to the truck. He had just started the engine, when Claire's figure showed up at the end of the tunnel. She was running, and one glance was enough to discern something was wrong. Westlake left the truck, walked towards her, faster the closer he get. Finally, he was running, too. Claire fell into his arms. \"Some terrorists have captured my Dad! They brought him down here; I recognized the surroundings and a number above a door! They threaten to kill him! Peyton, you must help me! Please, you must help me!\" The words struck him. \"I'm sorry… I cannot help you. Not anymore.\" He cursed the past days and his rage of destruction. The young woman looked up to him. \"I don't understand… You know this place like no one else does…I…I thought…\" Now she cried despite all her efforts. Westlake felt as if he had stabbed her in the back personally. What a wonderful last Good-bye indeed! He held her tightly. Of course she could not understand. She might have seen his distorted face, but he had hidden his distorted heart… However, hiding had lost its meaning. Perhaps it might even be the best way Claire knew the complete truth, before they parted forever. \"The Liquid-Skin-formula… I could use it not only to re-create my own face, but the features of others as well, if I possessed sufficient visual data to feed into the computer. It was nearly perfect… only not durable. I infiltrated the organization responsible for my condition and destroyed it from within. And similar ones, which ruined other people's life: drug and weapon's dealers… I let them pay and took their money for my research.\" \"You … killed them?\" Claire's incredulous whisper. \"Yes, if there was no other choice. And I would do it again now to help you and free your father, but I can't! I have no functioning equipment to do this… I'm sorry…\" Claire freed herself and made one step back. He had thought she would run away; to his surprise she stayed. \"I did not want you to kill anyone. I came here to ask if you could help me FINDING my Dad so we could inform the police and they could go in before these terrorists know anything!\"[Chapter 8] \" Black tears are running down your face But I will hold you in my arms\" (Blutengel, Song \"Behind your mask\") === New York Underground === So, this must be the feeling if you cut yourself the rope holding you back from falling into the depth… Peyton mused, and when Claire asked again if he would help her, he had only the strength for a silent nod. The last 120 minutes he had thought bargaining from destiny would be hell itself, now that she knew everything. She would part from him with disgust and pity for the poor mislead creature – and no other feeling would remain. Not a single spark of light to remember… \"The kidnappers mailed us a video\", Claire had continued. \"I recognized the area. It was down here. And I saw a number, painted above a metal door. 42. Nearby there was a grafitto that looked like some sort of ape with a machine gun.\" Westlake tried to focus. \"This could be… yes… the passage between lines 2 and 6.\" He hurried back into the chaos that once had been his lab and began digging through the junk. A little later he had found for what he was looking: the detailed plans of the subway lines, including service tunnels and electricity shafts. He unfolded one after another, until his fingers rested on one particular spot, marked with a fat \"42\". \"Here it is!\" And I've seen some suspects there during the last weeks, dammit! I wish I had acted then! Claire bowed over the plan. \"I'll inform the police!\" \"No! Your father would be dead before they could reach him. I know such police operations. They make far too much display of force; upsetting the criminals even more and give them too much time to freak out and kill someone. No. I will go.\" \"What do you think? These guys are ARMED!\" Claire had come down here worrying about her father, but at the moment she was full of fear for the man standing next to her. \"If this is about killing yourself, I… I won't let that happen!\" \"I thought you wanted to free your father.\" He withdrew behind the hastily erected barricade in his mind, not wanting to let come yet closer what already was too close. \"I want! But not if you risk your life that way, in a suicide attack!\" \"It's the only reasonable way, believe me. The risk for me will not be that big. I'm stronger than normal men, due to the treatment they gave me in the hospital after my accident. And Jerky will be at their throats before they can fire one shot. I will have the surprise on my side and therefore the opportunity to free your father.\" He stared at the map again. \"Your life, your knowledge, is too precious! Don't you understand? People need you! You have to go back to the university!\" \"No\", he answered sharper than intended and turned away to find something suitable as a makeshift weapon. Contrary to his statement shortly before, he did not feel very strong. He had not fully recovered from the electric shock three days ago. \"But think how many people you can heal if you complete professor Varinapam's research!\" \"I don't care!\" The lie tasted even more bitter spoken to her. He loosened an iron strut from one of his destroyed devices. This would do it – enough to get a man off his feet! \"You run away!\" Claire stood next to him again, and when he turned around, he discovered a fire of fierce desperation burn in her eyes. \"You don't understand. I can't go back! I can't simply start there where I had to stop 10 years ago!\" \"So for what have you working on this formula? Only to have a nice way to infiltrate some gangs and kill people?\" Westlake froze in his act. He was trapped. Silence fell; even the cats and Jerky did not move but only stared at their master. The man clutched onto the metal rod in his hands as if this was the only mean to keep him upright. \"I'm sorry…\" Claire whispered. \"I didn't want to say that…I'm only that…worried about Dad…I'm afraid.\" \"We will get him free,\" Westlake finally said and went past her, ending the discussion by that way. \"First I will lure them out to check their number and the situation… Jerky, come on! – Then I'll attack. You will wait nearby and try to get your father to the truck, if he is able to go. I show you how to operate it.\" He halted in front of the storage unit and carefully peeled the artificial skin from his skull. His true face would give him an extra advantage against the kidnappers… The sinister thought smouldered inside him, and the pain vented out in a sarcastic \"And you think I should return like this?\" in Claire's direction. She looked to the ground and hid her tears. === In the meantime / Bay Ridge / Claire's home === Anna Deveraux was at the end of her strength. The man who was the obvious leader of the kidnappers had called once again and given her specific instructions how to get the harddrive from Frank's computer and the other stuff they wanted. Not able to hold a screw driver or anything else, she had simply broken the case of the machine and cut the wires with a cisel. Now she crouched on the floor, trembling and crying, with the worst scenarios in her head, when the phone rang again. Them again! \"Yes? What ELSE do you WANT?\" she cried hysterically. \"Don't panic, Ma'am\", the guy at the other end said in his broad dialect, as if he was a good uncle from the neighborhood. \"No need for that if you do as we say. And you're very reasonable, aren't you? Yeeeaaah. You didn't call the police…\" \"NO! I told you! I called no one! I have this computer thing you want! What about my husband? I want to speak to him!\" \"Aw… he's a lil' out of business at the moment, Ma'am… He wasn't as cooperative as you are…\" \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?\" \"Shsh… don't panic… as I said… You remember there was another thing I badly need… a small donation…\" \"But I shouldn't talk to someone! If you want money I have to talk to my bank!\" \"I'm sure you can manage this…\" Anna Deveraux heard her husband moaning in the background and felt sick. God, what did these terrorists do to him? Where was the so-called Homeland-Defense, when every damned criminal could do such things right here in New York? \"Mrs. Deveraux? You can manage this, do you?\" \"Yes… yes…\" \"So don't keep us waiting any longer. Some of my men are al lil' impatient… Be at the designed place in two hours!\" \"But… but I can't! I can't make it in two hours!\" \"Wouldn't it be a pity if your nice Frankie-boy would loose one of his ears?\" He hung up. === In the Underground / Serviceroom 42 === \"What if this fuckin' chick freaks out?\" One of the men asked, when the telephon slipped back into the grip on the wall. \"She won't call the cops. She has far too much fear for her sweet darling here…\" A casual blow hit Frank Deveraux. \"Do you think you get very far with this?\" The prisoner murmured nonetheless. \"The files are encrypted! And you won't leave this country without getting caught!\" \"Hehe, smartass are we!\" The fist landed in Deveraux' stomach and he nearly fell backwards with the chair. \"We have your brain to dig the decryption out, right? And forget the police and National Guard – they are idiots! You shouldn't trust in them!\" He reached out again for a strike. However one of the other man held him back. \"Stop. If you beat him unconsious, he won't talk or he will make a shit of mistakes in the decryption!\" \"Yeah. Right. Still time to ice him after done business… what's this fucking noise outside? Joz, go and have a look!\" The man standing next to the door grabbed his machine gun, disengaged the lock and kicked the door open. Some meters away, he discerned a large figure, obviously very shaky on his legs, and smelling after cheap booze. \"Only one of these drunken rats!\" The armed man shouted back to his comrades inside, before turning his attention back to the hobo. \"Ey, man, piss off!\" He waved his gun, but didn't dare shooting. The boss had forbidden it if not in absolute necessity. The sound would draw certainly too much unwanted attention down here. \"Piss off!\" The rag-bundle stumbled down into the mud only a meter away. \"Fucking hell! Just –\" The light from inside fell on the hobo's face, a sight letting the kidnapper step backwards with a frantic roar. Then he fired his gun into this 'Nightmare on Elm's Street…. At least, he tried it, but only hit the vault above, because a metal rod smashed into his legs and let his knees buckle. The next second, a pitbull jumped against him. Chaos broke out. More shots, cries, curses. … Claire cowered in the darkness besides the railway truck and followed the events full of anxiety. Still she thought it would have been better to inform the police and let them handle the situation. With every second she regretted more not to have done so. If they die both, it will be my fault… She saw another one of the kidnappers go down; it seemed to be at least four of them. Somewhere Jerky barked and growled. But the moment of surprise was gone now, and the man was on his feet far too fast, got a hold on Westlake and threw him down. The iron strut slid from his hands against one of the computers. Sparks flew and then it was nearly completely dark. But out of the darkness still came the sounds of a reckless hand-to-hand-combat, and then again shots. Claire bit her lip. Her heart hammered. Peyton had ordered her to wait here for his sign; she could not sit here for much longer though! And where was her Dad? Perhaps she had been mistaken with the number… or he had been brought to another place… and everything was in vain! Some eerie cracking metallic sound echoed through the underground. Then a flashlight was switched on; the light flitted over the scenery. Claire discerned someone crawling alongside the overthrown table and some equipment. Dad? The young woman was not sure. However, the next moment a guy with a gun in his hand grabbed the fugitive, yelling something to his comrades. Now she could clearly recognize the features of her father. This goes wrong… this goes totally wrong! Without another thought, the young woman searched for her cellphone, and dialed 911. Something wet and warm touched her left hand. Jerky. At least the dog seemed unharmed! She padded his muscular shoulders. Another scratching metallic sound, then shattering glass, a series of shots and human cries. Claire barely dared to look into the direction of the service room. Instinctively, her fingers closed around Jerkys collar. O God, please, don't let them be dead… She turned towards the last clanking sound and discovered the flashlight lying on the stone floor, still switched on. A body lay stretched out in the yellow lightcone; she could not say if dead or just injured. But a little further, she discovered her father, trying to get up with still shackled hands and legs. \"Dad!\" she cried and forgot the order to stay put near the truck. The dog went ahead barking. \"Dad!\" Frank Deveraux did not trust his eyes. \"Claire? What the hell are YOU doing down here?\" \"I explain later…\" She wiped away the suddenly bursting tears. \"Are you… are you okay, Dad?\" Seeing the destruction around and the blood on her fathers face and clothes, she felt dizzy. Her stomach moved upwards and hastily she reached out for the wall. And where was Peyton? \"I've already felt better,\" answered her father. \"What a nightmare… \" He coughed, looked around and shook his head. \"You did call the police? Don't know if these bastards have still some reinforcements somewhere… Claire?\" Frank Deveraux watched his daughter, which from one second to another not only looked exhausted and pale, but frightened to death. Her tears ran dry; she was too terrified to even cry. Thinking she might have seen one of the enemies behind him with a gun pointed at them he tried to push her out of the way, but could not reach her. Claire was already two steps deeper in the gloom and now fell to her knees besides one of the figures on the ground. \"Peyton? … O my God…\" She stared at him and the blood glinting in a rusty red. This was worse than last time she found him… much worse! She tried to check his pulse, but was too nervous to get anything. Her father said something, however it did not get through, it rested some strange noise at the border of her consciense. \"Peyton?\" She was hardly able to move her hands and open his coat, then his shirt. More blood… And a faint moan – or was she mistaken? Her own blood seemed to roar like thunder in her head. \"You can't die! Do you hear me? You can't die!\" Where is the police and some medics? Where, damned shit? She was afraid like never before in her life. He lay before her and died, and there was nothing, absolutely nothing she could do about it…[Chapter 9] (Ok, I warn you it gets a little soapy and heartbreaking… keep your Kleenex within reach!) === Two days later / A private hospital in Bay Ridge === Senator Beckman, a middle –aged man with wrinkles of concern in his face, had taken place in the hospital room shortly ago. In the presence of a journalist, he had exchanged some words with the patient occupying the room, Frank Deveraux. Then he asked the press to leave and give them a little privacy. \"Frank, this was very close,\" Beckman repeated when they were alone. \"I told you how often exactly to get a bodyguard? Your work is too important for national security! We can only thank God this homeless stepped in this time. Next time you won't be that lucky, perhaps! – How is the man, by the way?\" \"Still in intensive care. The medics said one cannot be sure if he ever wakes up. He was hit pretty badly.\" \"Poor guy. Heard the President say something about a decoration, though.\" The Senator looked out of the window. Surely his chauffeur was waiting, but he did not want to be chased by his schedule today. Frank was an old friend! \"I understood he had been a scientist before he landed on the streets?\" \"Yes, as far as I know. - The three surviving criminals are on their way to Guantanamo, the police officer told me this morning, right?\" \"Yes. We have to get their connections out of them.\" Some minutes passed in silence, and then the Senator continued: \"How is your wife?\" \"Better. She is at home now, but still under sedation and observance by a psychologist. This was really difficult for her. You know her; how fragile and sensitive she is.\" \"Nonetheless, she did remarkably well! Brave woman, same as your daughter! I hope I'll see you all for a nice dinner evening soon.\" \"Of course, thank you, Jacob. But for now I can't promise anything.\" \"Tell Anna she must be strong, an example for the wives and mothers of our soldiers fighting terrorism outside our country!\" \"Please, no election speeches right now, Jacob…\" Frank Deveraux felt not up to that. He was worried about his daughter. She seemed …. obsessed… about the mysterious rescuer, about whom she obviously knew far more than the rest of the world. The prospect his 'little girl' had hidden something from him was not very comforting. Senator Beckman sighed. \"Forgive me. Old habit… Just give Anna and Claire my regards and best wishes!\" \"I will.\" …. In another ward of the hospital, Claire stood at the front desk of the reception. \"Why can't I see him? Just for some moments?\" \"My colleague already told you half an hour ago and many times before, Miss Deveraux,\" The answer sounded obviously annoyed. \"The patient is in intensive care priority one, and after the regulations no one except medical staff is allowed to see him.\" \"But you COULD run me through the same cleaning procedures as the medical staff! Please!\" \"No, I can't. These are the regulations. I don't want to loose my job.\" However, the nurse felt sorry for the young woman who in all her exhaustion and desperation was nearing a nervous breakdown. She was here for two days now and barely moved away from the visitor's bench. She had slept some minutes sitting here, but that was all. \"Miss Deveraux, please, sit down. This helps no one. We can give you something to relax, if you wish.\" \"I do not! I …\" Claire sighed, ran a shaky hand through her hair. \"Please, let me see him! I… pay you! I'll make a donation to the hospital!\" …\"Claire.\" She startled and spun around. Her father was behind her and now put a hand on her arm. \"Claire-darling. Come home with me. You need some rest.\" \"I want to visit Peyton! Why does no one understand? Shit! Do I speak Chinese?\" \"Claire, calm down. You can't see him. And he wouldn't notice if you did, anyway. He is in a coma and does neither see nor hear you.\" \"I just want to help… somehow…\" she answered sobbing and searched for a paper tissue. \"He has all the help he needs. The medics here are among the best of our country. You can be sure they'll do everything they can to help him. And if he doesn't make it despite all their efforts – \" \"NO!\" \"Claire… listen to me, I know it is hard. But… maybe it is better for him, if he does not survive. Have you ever –\" She pushed her father back with a violent gesture. \"Dad, how can you even THINK such a thing?\" The outburst had drawn every last attention to them. Suddenly, it was very quiet around the front desk and the next floor. \"Sorry… Dad…\" \"Come home with me, Claire. Please. Your mother needs you, too. If you want to help, help her.\" \"Mom has you and all her friends to comfort her. Peyton has no one except me.\" The young woman assembled her last strength to communicate the decision she just had made in her mind. \"I'll stay!\" \"You cannot stay here. You know that. Please don't make it more difficult for all of us, darling. You come home with me, and the hospital can call you if anything changes.\" Claire hesitated. Then she said: \"Okay.\" She breathed deeply. \"I cannot stay here, right. I go… into the hotel on the other side of the road. And you will call me immediately if something happens?\" \"We will, Miss Deveraux.\" The nurse was happy to see a solution within range. \"Mr. Westlake is in best care, as your father said. We will call you. You can go over and sleep some hours. We call you, I promise.\" === In the hotel === Claire took a room as planned. Barely in it, she had gone over to the window, from where she could see the hospital. Staring out in the early morning and the dimming street lights with burning eyes, she truly realized how much Peyton Westlake meant to her. It was not about walking around with a gorgeous looking guy to impress her girlfriends and Jenna in particular; not about this wonderful smile which let her melt and forget everything. No, this was only a superficial decoration… It was about HIM alone; about the man inside the unimportant shell, behind the mask, behind the darkness… Claire felt the butterflies inside her battering their wings again, and pulling, not like some funny fluffy little things, but more like an army of angels. Strong, warm and full of light. There was no pondering anymore how she should tell her family, if she should tell Jenna. She would just tell it and to hell with the opinion of them. She did not care. If only Peyton survived. Her eyelids fell... … She awoke some hours later, with aching neck and back, having slept in an awkward position on the chair. Which time was it? It was full day, no doubt. What if I missed a call from the hospital? O my God! She ran into the bathroom, provided herself with a 5-minutes-care and was out of the room, not even bothering with closing the door behind her. She did not wait for the elevator, but ran down the stairs. === In the hospital === Out of breath Claire arrived at the ward and stumbled across a briefing between two docs and the nurse at the front desk. She recognized one of them as the head physician. His look was tired and grave. The young woman stopped in her tracks, afraid of what she might hear any second. She wanted to run, but could not. \"Miss Deveraux…\" The nurse had discovered her. \"Did you… call me?\" she managed. The nurse denied, however Claire was all but relieved. \"Is… is he…\" she felt as if she would choke. \"I want to be honest with you, Miss Deveraux,\" one of the medics now said. \"It looks not good. \" Claire understood this meant 'it looks very bad', even before he continued: \"We nearly lost him last night, and the life signs are still very unstable. I'm afraid, we cannot –\" Claire ran past him and pushed open the door to the ward's floor. The next moment, two hands grabbed her shoulders. \"Miss! Miss, if you go in like this, you'll kill him with a high probability!\" She nodded and let herself guide to an adjacent room, where the medical staff normally changed cloths. Somewhat later, she finally sat besides Peyton's bed. He was nearly unrecognizable with the attached respirator and more cables and wires leading to various machines. The equipment made low beeping sounds. It was the only thing reminding Claire, he was still alive. Gently, she caressed his face, where she could reach it. She did not even notice the mutilations anymore. It was the face of the man she loved. For her it was beautiful. He did not react in any way. Claire leaned back, took his hand and began to talk. That she had Jerky and the cats in her custody at home, first, and then all other things crossing her mind. Wasn't it said, talking helped comatose people to find their way back? She did not know. But as long as she spoke, she did not hear the creepy sound of the machines and she could imagine being in another place with him. On a beach perhaps… under a palm tree… On some point she was that tired that she half fell asleep, humming the melody she had taken when dancing with him in the Old City Hall Station. … Peyton Westlake discerned the faint, soft sound at the edge of his consciousness. He felt the warmth of a hand holding him. It was a comforting, wonderful sensation, filled with contentment and peace. It made him wish to see who was providing this… He attempted to speak, and the effort to manage this despite the respirator let him regain consciousness. Discovering his surroundings, panic followed. A hospital room – o no! And he could not move – again! What did they do to him this time? And WHO? He tried to lift his head – not possible, too. No, this could not be! In his frantic attempt to get free he woke Claire. \"It's okay, it's okay…\" she whispered, seeing the fear in his eyes. \"You are in a hospital in Bay Ridge… \" She couldn't stop the tears of exhaustion and joy and hastily wiped over her face. \"Everything will be fine… You've been shot, remember? And… I… thought you wouldn't make it…. O God… I say such silly things… I'm sorry! I'm only that glad you woke up again… \" She felt like embracing him, but this was impossible at the moment. All she could do was squeezing his hand. Claire, he thought, with a considerable effort trying to put his mind in order, but failed. The words he wanted to speak vanished before they could reach his mouth. He felt too weak for keeping his eyes open any longer. But his fear was gone. If she was here, the place had to be okay. He trusted her. And the sound… the music… When he drifted away in a dream again, he danced with Claire through the Old City Hall Station, and then on the streets, as if they were the only people on earth. And in his dream at least, he was the happiest man on earth. === Some days later / Bay Ridge / Claire's home === Anna Deveraux still looked pale and tired, with dark rings under her eyes. She had not been much out of the house the past days. And her worries about her daughter did not make it any easier for her to go back to normal. She let a tranquillizer fall into a glass with water and said in the direction of her husband: \"Claire practically LIVES in the hospital, Frank. We have to do something. This is not good for her. She does not know what she is doing. She is… is acting weird since the incident in the subway! She has to get away from all this!\" \"Yes, I know. I tried to speak with her. She won't listen – and in fact, I can't order her anything; she is full age.\" He put the newspaper he was reading down, couldn't find enough concentration. As hard as he tried, it would take a while for him too, to get back to his normal life and the work on the project. A vacation would be great, indeed. However, the missile guiding system was not yet completed; he could not simply go on holiday. His sense of duty did not allow that. And yes… Claire… \"She thinks she loves him, Anna. It's what she told me yesterday.\" \"Love! This is simply… I don't know what to say… She is a sensible child and feels somewhat responsible, that's what it is. Of course she cannot see this now…we have to help her out of this, for her own good! And what about this man… I constantly forget his name!\" \"Westlake.\" Frank stood up and went to the house bar. He needed something stronger than herbal tea right now! \"Does he encourage her in any way? He must know we are rich…\" \"Don't know.\" \"Heavens! She is a little girl! She is… she is … our little baby! She CAN'T love this… this…\" Anna Deveraux ended with a sigh, not daring to speak out what she really thought, because this man had rescued her husband's life; and not finding any suitable, sugar coated expression to use instead. \"I mean… we don't know anything about this man! He lived down in the underground of New York for – how long?\" \"Ten years, Claire said.\" Frank Deveraux emptied a glass of Bourbon. \"Ten years! He can't have kept a sane state of mind in living in these catacombs; that's simply not possible. Whatever a great scientific mind or else he was before – what is he now? This is what counts when I think of my poor little girl. And how old is he, by the way? I don't want Claire ending in poverty or mistreated by some madman, who looks like –\" Anna stopped considering this inappropriate to say and drank something instead. \"I don't want Claire rushing into some crazy decisions she will regret the rest of her life,\" she continued after a while.[Chapter 10] When I touched your skin for the first time, I felt heaven in my hands So I try to close my eyes. And I'm dreaming me away. (BLUTENGEL, Song \"In my dreams\") === Bay Ridge / Hospital === Over a week had passed since Westlake woke up first, grasped by the panic to be in the hands of some 'scientists' eager to experiment on him again. Meanwhile his fears had settled for a big part. These medics were actually here to help him… He felt much better already. For 4 days now, he was out of intensive care. The additional strength supported a better healing process, it seemed. He had already wondered about this side effect 8 years ago after he had ripped the controlling device out of his neck. Moreover… hope had sneaked in again, like a thief, unnoticed first and only detected when it was too late to overwhelm him. First, Peyton had struggled against the various alluring possibilities, the prospects suddenly enfolding and being within reach again. He had fought against them like a thirsty man in the desert against visions of shade and water. However the thirst had been greater than all rationality. He did not want to let go of the vision. He could not. Hope was like a drug. Once tasted, it made addicted. Things had happened, which only rooted deeper the hope in his mind. One day, the door had opened and one of his old colleagues showed up. Hendrik Reinitzer acted as if only some days separated them from the time as assistants in the Medical Department. When he left, Peyton had asked for some summaries from Varinapam's publications. Meanwhile he felt well enough again to read some pages of them. Still it was too straining to concentrate longer than half an hour consecutively, but it was getting better every day. Hope to resume his work soon! Hope to finally find the right formula! And then, there was Claire. She made it somehow believable his hopes could be fulfilled. Her presence made him really forget who he was; not only some seconds, but all the time she was in this room. He fought against this feeling like against the growing hope. In the quiet hours, when Claire had left, the fear to loose everything again was a dark agonizing cloud hovering over him. He did not want these feeling, because to feel also meant the possibility for disappointment and pain. However, his heart clearly did not listen to these rational computations. … Claire was sitting next to him and talked about the latest adventures of the cats and Jerky, and her mother's worries about these 'flea bags' – even after an additional cleaning process at the veterinary! Peyton reached out and let his fingers slide through her hair and over her cheek. It felt wonderful; as he had imagined the moment he danced with her in the Old City Hall Station. No… it was a far more beautiful sensation! He was not certain if it was the same when he had touched Julie long ago. It seemed… different, and probably not only because of his still rudimentary ability to sense anything. Perhaps it was… just her. Or the fact that he had lived deprived of this sort of contact for so long. Claire smiled and took his hand. They looked into each others eyes. There were moments like this one, when reality pierced him with all its force again and threw him down. He wanted to embrace and kiss her (and if he was honest to himself, he wanted much more than this alone) but for now this all was out of question. \"Claire… I don't know, how long it'll take… It could take 'onths… and i' there are sudden di'iculties… it could take years.\" \"So I will wait with you and help you through\", she answered. \"I mean, I won't be a crack in Medicine or Bioengineering, but – I can prepare you the best morning coffee ever! For instance…\" I love her, he thought, I love her and I want her, and I really go mad… === Bay Ridge / Claire's home === Claire sat on the couch in the living room and felt like on trial. \"I have to talk to you,\" her mother had said, looking still deranged and nervous. And the young woman had chosen to listen in order to not upset her further. Nonetheless, the communication was nearing a dispute… \"Claire-darling, I know this man has rescued you and your father. Of course Frank and I are very, very, grateful about that. It was a great gesture-\" \"A great GESTURE, Mom? He risked his life for persons he did not even know! He nearly DIED!\" \"You understand what I'm trying to say. It was a brave action, and for that he deserves our gratitude. Be assured, we will recompense him adequately, with anything he requests. A place to live, a monthly check, anything.\" Anna Deveraux stopped pacing through the room and rested in front of her daughter. \"I know you feel responsible for what happened to this poor man –\" \"His name is Peyton!\" Claire was getting angry. Her mother still talked about him as if he was a nameless hobo not worth remembering, only worth to let a buck fall into pleading hands and then walk by. Anna Deveraux repeated: \"I know it is difficult for you, Claire-darling. But you ARE not responsible for his condition. He gets all necessary treatment in the hospital. In fact, we sponsor the hospital; you are surely informed of that. It is of no use visiting him daily! On the contrary, this could disturb the medical procedures. Claire, you have done more than enough, and it is time to occupy with other important things, as your studies!\" Her studies didn't interest her the slightest at the moment. \"Mom, I do not visit him, because I feel guilty! I LOVE HIM!\" It was good to say it aloud in her presence. She was in the mood now, and would have liked to continue with words like 'I go with him to the end of the world and raise a family and I don't want your help!' But the shocked expression of her mother let the words stuck in her throat. Anna Deveraux was as pale as the designer couch. To hear this from Claire herself was nearly too much to handle. \"Claire…you act impulsive and irrationally. I only want the best for you… please, understand.\" \"Mom. I appreciate your concerns. But I KNOW what I'm doing. I'm no baby anymore!\" \"You're acting upset and weird since your incident in the Subway; since you first crossed the path of this man! Claire, find back to your senses! Perhaps it would be good if you go on a little vacation, to forget everything. Perhaps to Aunt Louise in Toulouse…\" \"I won't go anywhere!\" She jumped to her feet. \"Claire, what I mean is: you don't know this man!\" \"Why can't you say his name? Is something wrong with it?\" \"Please… don't raise your voice like that. I have such a headache….\" Anna Deveraux sighed. \"The medics at the hospital made some tests with him. He suffers from a major neurological imbalance. Dr. Coley judged him mentally highly unstable. Now you understand, why-\" \"You let them do experiments on him?\" Claire shouted now. She didn't care about her mother's headache or the housekeeper in the kitchen. \"Claire! Heavens! Don't you see you are not yourself? No one did torture this man. Only some simple, harmless tests performed on many patients with neurological trauma or something similar!\" \"You let them make tests on him BEHIND MY BACK! I told you what he is gone through, and you ordered this!\" The young woman ran out of the room, without giving any attention to her mother anymore. Tears of anger and disappointment burned in her eyes, while she hastily searched for her passport, her credit card, and some clothing. She threw everything in her backpack and shortly after she was on the staircase again. \"Claire? Claire-darling? What are you doing?\" She was out of the door. === At the hospital === Westlake still felt slightly disoriented, when Claire came to visit him, one hour earlier than usually allowed. She had made quite a scene outside at the front desk, until the nurse decided it would be the best just let her through, than to cause trouble in the whole ward. \"Claire…?\" He squeezed his eyes. \"They did so'thing to 'e…\" A nasty doubt was bugging him, if he could still trust her, or if everything had only been a ruse. \"They injected me so'thing…\" \"It's okay. It was nothing bad. Just a little post-op-check-thing,\" she said, taking his hand. She felt evil about lying to him; however she did not want to compromise her mother, too. \"How do you feel now?\" \"Don't know…\" He shook his head; tried to get a clear mind and to get rid of the doubts about Claire. \"I ha' to get out o' here. Soon. … Ha' to start 'orking…\" \"You are not fit enough for work, Peyton, you know that.\" \"Yes…\" And I have no place to stay… he thought, …even if I get the job at the Columbia again, the bureaucracy has to be done before. No one would give me that an important position with just a handshake. I have to be up to this! With considerable effort, he forced his mind out of the haze. \"I ha' to start 'orking, Claire! E'en though I ha' to sit in a 'heelchair!\" \"I'll get you out of here as soon as I can, I promise!\" she whispered, letting her head rest besides his for a moment. \"I can… bring you a laptop, if you feel well enough for that?\" He nodded. He simply HAD to feel well enough! Still the string from hope to reality was a fragile thing. He had to make it a little bit stronger. But for now, it was too much. He fell asleep and did not notice Claire crying. The young woman did not know what to do. She had checked in at the hotel next door again and so far denied every call from her mother or father on the celly. Perhaps this was not wise. Perhaps her parents would call the police, and then everything would get worse. She planned to talk to her girlfriend Jenna. But for the moment she only wanted to stay here. If possible, she would've rested at Peyton's bed like a watch dog and take care nothing else happened. === Two days later === The mansion of the Deveraux's at Bay Ridge was again in agitation. \"Frank,\" Anna had just said in leaving the lunch table without eating anything, \"she won't listen to me! She answers no calls! It's as if she is in… in a kind of religious sect! You HAVE to do something! I don't want to loose our only child to an unpredictable maniac!\" Frank Deveraux folded his napkin together. He did not like this situation, but considering the state of mind of his family, he decided something had to be done. … Peyton was surprised to see Claire's father again. He had visited him once, with a press-team on tail, which was out for a photo of the rescued shaking hands with the rescuer. He knew from Claire, her parents weren't too fond about the 'relationship' between him and their daughter. For that, he was curious what this was all about. Frank Deveraux had the air of a business man in a hurry who did not want to repeat his important decisions twice. \"Mr. Westlake, I hope you're feeling well.\" His voice betrayed his non-existing interest in this matter. \"Yes. Thank you. Sorry I can't talk good. I'll try.\" \"Don't worry. It is not important for you to speak. Only to listen to my proposal… my offer, in fact.\" He cleared his throat. \"I know you are eager to go back to your research and if possible get the position of the late Professor Varinapam at the Medical Department. I know it is your goal to complete the work on the liquid skin and make it applicable in day-to-day-hospital treatment. It is certainly known to you the project lacks funding and the Dean is not sure yet if there is enough money to provide without the star of a Nobel Prize – winner like Varinapam. Well… you saved my life. You did a great thing for our country. I'm willing to fund the project and move you at its head, Mr. Westlake…\" Peyton watched the man in front of him. This was an awesome offer, something like a fairy letting rain golden stars in his hands. But… there was a trait in the face and the eyes of Frank Deveraux not suitable to a fairy's gift. A cold and hard shine. He sensed his heart hammering and suddenly felt very vulnerable – vulnerable vis-à-vis his own emotions! \"I'm willing to support your research by any means you need,\" Deveraux had continued. \"Under one condition: you won't come close to my daughter Claire again.\" One second a crispy silence lasted in the room, already loaded with the energy ready to burst out. Peyton stared at the man, while his unbelievable 'offer' started filling his mind with anger. You can't do this to me! You can't! The next moment he was up and hurled against this man in his black suit with his stone heart – at least he tried it. A blinding pain shot through him, everything was spinning around him and he fell to his knees close to the bed, taking the infusion device with him. === Next Day === Because she had an appointment with one of her professors at the University, Claire came to the hospital only in the afternoon. After the awful discovery not to find Peyton in his usual room, she had been running from one nurse and medic to the other, only to find meagre excuses. What was going on here? Why did no one tell her what had happened? Eventually, she stormed into the office of the head physician and was surprised to get an answer without any resistance. \"I'm sorry, Miss Deveraux , you have to learn it that way,\" he said, not looking up from his papers until now. \"There was an incident and –\" \"What? An incident? And… and he is…\" Claire felt numbness spreading in her. \"Mr. Westlake attacked your father…\" My father? What did he want here? \"…and then a medic who tried to hold him back,\" continued the head physician. \"We had to sedate him and put him into restraints. Unfortunately…and despite our precautions…\" He let out a short sigh, \"Mr. Westlake escaped. This morning, supposedly. And we don't know where he is.\" Claire did not know if she should be relieved or worried. Peyton was alive – but the circumstances were rather sinister. And whereto did he go, in his condition? She tried to put her racing thoughts in at least a little order. She didn't notice the door opening and her mother entering, until Anna Deveraux began to speak. \"Claire-darling…\" \"Mom? What … are you doing here?\" \"The nurse at the front desk called me when you showed up. She thought you might perhaps need some comfort. After these horrific news…\" Claire did not want her here, but at the moment she had not enough strength to discuss this or simply leave the office. \"He can't have left this way… simply left…\" she whispered. \"My poor little one, I know how you must feel.\" Her mother embraced her, but Claire could not return the gesture. All she was was concentrated on Peyton and why he had run away – again! Everything had seemed perfect, just yesterday! \"He can't have left! There is something bad going on, Mom! We must…must find him!\" \"Claire-darling, I told you he is unpredictable, mentally unstable. All I ever wanted was spare you a moment like this! Come home with me.\" There was something subconscious kicking in. She was too upset right now to let it come forward into her mind, but nevertheless, it rested a warning feeling. Something was wrong. \"I cannot come with you… sorry, Mom. I simply cannot.\" \"But – Claire!\" \"I'm sorry,\" she repeated and walked out of the door and back into the hotel. She felt too exhausted to decide what to do. She wanted to be alone, that was all. … Hours went by, while Claire still tried figuring out what had happened, and why. The things she knew did not fit together. Peyton had attacked her father? But why should he have done this? What did her father want in the hospital anyway? She wondered if she should call him and ask but had the distinct feeling she wouldn't get any answer. Yes, something was wrong… Which reason Peyton could have to attack and then escape? A disturbed mind like her mother said? No, Claire didn't believe that! I know him. I know him and he would not do this without a cause , she repeated to herself. Especially not now, when the job at the University and the finishing of the research are within reach! This Reinitzer-guy had just called yesterday again! And his pets… Jerky and the four cats! He would never go and leave them alone! The longer the young woman sat at the window in the hotel room, the more she was certain of it. Perhaps they had made more 'tests' with him at the hospital and he had panicked and fled? I shouldn't have left him alone this day! I should've rescheduled this damned appointment! It was nearly midnight, when Claire decided to look for Westlake at the one spot where he possibly would hide: the underground. She felt far less secure this time in walking through the tunnels now, than before, when she had come rescuing her father. Now everything seemed frightening again, and dark. Sometimes she thought to hear a voice in the distance. She called Peyton's name, but never got an answer. She began feeling silly and then she was afraid having lured out some bad people with her calls. However, no one except some rats crossed her way down. And she found Peyton's hiding place exactly as she had seen it the last time. An untouched chaos. Nonetheless, Claire looked in every dark corner. He was not here. This made her worrying even more. Where could he be in his condition? Had someone picked him up and hospitalized elsewhere? Or was he still out there on the streets, in this cold? Should she inform the police? Or rather not? She climbed into the old subway wagon, where he had his old shelter, and huddled up in a corner, to find some warmth for herself. === Meanwhile / Medical Department of the University === The tall man had walked slowly down the street, from time to time seeking hold on the wall of a house or a fence. A young couple passing him made a comment about drunkards everywhere in the city. The man did not react. Eventually, he entered a doorway and headed towards a couple of still illuminated windows on the far end. Yes, Hendrik Reinitzer was still a night shifter! And the past weeks even more, with all the papers of Varinapam to assort and prepare for his successor! The last steps to the illuminated windows were difficult to master. Westlake leaned against the house for several minutes to recover a little, but the ice cold wind seemed to only take his breath. Snow fell. He had certainly not been in shape for a walk. However, the money Claire had left him in the hospital, had not been enough for a taxi ride nearly across New York! He clenched his teeth and stepped on. This was his last chance! He could not give up now! Shortly after the bell of the laboratory section rang, and Dr. Reinitzer went to the door, silently cursing about who-the-hell was bothering him at 2 AM! He opened yawning and his brain needed a second to grasp the view in front of him. \"Das kann nicht wahr sein-\" in his surprise, he spoke German. He blinked. „Peyton? … Your face…\" \"It's the last of my… unstable creations. I wanted to… to speak understandable…\" His voice trailed of with the wind. Realizing his unexpected guest was barely able to stand any longer, Reinitzer reached out, lent a supporting arm and helped him inside. \"What are you doing here? Are you mad? You belong into a hospital bed, not out on the street? Do you want to kill yourself?\" \"There's not much … left to kill…\" Westlake sank on a chair and fought against the weakness. \"Take me to Varinapam's computer, please. I did some… some calculations…\" \"I'd rather call an ambulance, man! Cannot believe they let you out of the hospital!\" \"Listen! Listen, Hendrik! I cannot go back! I need your help! I have to work! Please… don't let me down… this is the last chance … I have!\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Let me start to work! I went over my old files… I did some calculations, I KNOW-\" \"Peyton,\" Reinitzer grabbed him at the shoulders, \"of course you will start to work here, if we have the okay from the Dean, and the funding! Of course you will, no questions. Calm down, okay? And now I call an ambulance…\" \"Please… you know it can be done! I just need Varinapam's original files… the sequencing codes… please, let me work!\" \"I can't, you know that. You can't simply walk in here and go on this computer and search through those files! I mean, this is sensitive material, and there are restrictions all around, I can't allow you! I would loose my position and you every hope of getting the job anyway. -Peyton, stop, you can't go in there! It's key-card secured!\" \"So give me yours!\" \"Don't you understand what I'm saying?\" With a hasty move, Reinitzer was at Westlake's side again, who stood next to the glass door to the office, hands put on the wall for support. \"You don't understand… Let me tell you: Mr. Frank Deveraux, the man I rescued from these terrorists, 'offered' me something.\" He spat the word 'offering'. \"He said he would manage I… get the position of Varinapam. And the … funding! If I stayed away from HIS DAUGHTER!\" A short moment of silence followed this outburst, and then he added: \"I can't betray her that way! But I will never reach results with stable samples WITHOUT Varinapam's files! And without stable samples I will never - … Don't you understand?\" He was short before crying, yet alone of exhaustion. \"Please let me work… Only some hours… No one has to know…\" \"I can't! And you can't either, in your condition. I'm sorry.\" Peyton had not enough strength to translate the desperate anger forming in him into outside force. He turned around, faced his ex-colleague one last time, but let the words coming into his mind unsaid. Reinitzer looked down like a reprimanded child. \"I'm really sorry, it's just…\" He shrugged. \"I'm no one here… no one to make a decision…\" Westlake walked past him, holding himself upright with his last strength and went through the door. When Reinitzer realized he was no longer in the room, he sped to the entrance, and looked out, calling. But amidst the dense falling snow, nothing was to see anymore.[Chapter 11] === A Salvation Army Shelter === The last thing happening the night before still in Peyton's memory was how he cowered in front of a shop window and watched the artificial skin of his face dissolve and expose the disfigured features behind. When he regained consciousness, he lay in a shelter of the Salvation Army. It was midday. No one had brought him back to the hospital or had him reported to the police, obviously. So no one was looking for him. As expected, they were glad he was gone and spared them further trouble. Probably Frank Deveraux congratulated himself that his little deal had turned out even better than planned… It was as he had told Claire once, Peyton thought. The worst demons were hiding inside men. The demons of selfishness, greed and arrogance, which lead their hosts away from the path of human compassion, made them believe they could buy everything with their money, and exonerate themselves from everything. In fact, these people were more wretched than the gang members of Durant he had hunted down ten years ago. These criminals knew they stood outside the society. But men like Frank Deveraux thought themselves good citizens, proper businessmen, patriots. And yet they were ready to kill another man's last hope and this with a nonchalant smile and a shrug. Peyton closed his hands around the half empty soup cup and leaned back again. That he was able to keep the normal nutrition in his stomach, he took as a good sign. His body had endured the stress he had imposed himself yesterday. The pain in his chest was still nagging, but he considered this a minor issue. If he would suffer from internal bleeding, the pain certainly would be much greater and he would probably have lost consciousness again. So all I need is some rest and I can go back to my old live! My old life… The bitterness gave way to a new wave of pain, not the one from his wound, but the one deep inside. Claire. Now she was out of reach again, in an undefined distance. Would she worry about him? For sure. He had to contact her… say Good-Bye at least. He loved her far too much to burden her with the man he was now for thinking of any other possibility. My old life… There was no way getting out of the darkness and into the light, to make his cherished dreams a reality. In musing about this, he let his gaze wander through the room. It was a large hall with old wooden tables and chairs, cushions on some of them. Other homeless sat here eating or sleeping on the spot, some of their bags in the arms like a lover his sweetheart. Old newspapers lay crumbled on the ground; a skinny dog sniffed through them. Peyton thought of Jerky, Smokey and the other cats. Another pain inside him. Then his eyes were caught by a framed photograph on the wall. It showed two Salvation Army officers and another man, whom they thanked for a donation. 'We thank for the magnanimity which gave us the opportunity to help those in need'. Westlake stared at the line. Claire's voice sounded through his mind \" You must go back to the University, Peyton! Think of the many people you can help with your research!\" Yes, it was not only about him! Frank Deveraux in his damned arrogance had not only cut HIS lifeline, but the one of many other burn victims, too! These people need you… You have to go back…\" Slowly, an idea formed in his mind. If Deveraux could play mean – yes, he could do the same! He was ready to fight! === New York Underground / Later the day === Peyton had asked one of the Salvation Army officers to give him some bandages for his head, and then to take him along to Grand Central. From there he entered the underground again and headed towards his old refuge - with longer and longer pauses in between. But he managed to walk further, driven by a new-found confidence. With the calculations done after reading some of Varinapam's papers; with the basics for a molecular structure in his mind he was now closer to a solution than all the years before. He needed access to the computer files; to the samples used by Varinapam, the RNA - sequences of the deep sea species! Success was not a vague dream anymore; it had become a realistic option. And he would not allow men like Deveraux to ruin not only his life completely, but also those of thousands of other victims. He would fight! He had reached his old realm, switched the lights on and gave the destruction a wry smile. Home sweet home… Certainly, it would take some time to get the equipment working again. He needed at least one sample of his creation… With his sleeve, he shoved some of the debris from the desk. Somehow he thought he could control the bursts of anger and violence better. He was not sure why; it was simply the feeling to regain control. He had seen the bottom of the abyss of 'human' arrogance and selfishness – and rage was nothing what could fight this. It only made him like them… Nevertheless, first he had to recover himself! A little bit shaky, Peyton crawled into his wagon – shelter and stopped when he discovered the figure on the mattress. Claire? Was he hallucinating? \"Claire…?\" No, the figure moved quite natural, looked up to him and then embraced him. No hallucination, no dream! \" 'hat are you doing here?\" \"Searching for you!\" She put the blanket around him. \"I thought you might come back… but I almost lost hope! What happened? Why did you leave the hospital? You are not well at all…\" She was loosening the bandages from his head. \"You really must be crazy!\" \"Had no other choice…\" Claire listened and began feeling ice cold. \"I can't believe Dad did such a thing…\" she whispered. No, this was not true. In fact, she could very well imagine her parents doing this. With this realization, the last sympathy for their decisions was gone. Did they KNOW what they had done? Did they POSSIBLY know? Claire held Peyton very close and felt bad only because she was the daughter of such beings. \"We will go to another University,\" she said then. \"You can start there anew. I come with you! I don't care, if it takes a bit longer until you are successful, until you get your face back! I don't care at all! As long as you are alive, and I'm with you, it doesn't matter how you look! Do you understand? They can all… all go to hell!\" She started crying. \"No. I 'ont 'ait longer than necessary!\" He took her hands which she had put around his face. \"The research is nearly co'lete. It CAN 'e done! I only need the right equi'ent! I'll go 'u'lic with this, I'll go to a TV station. Tell the' 'hat I could reach, how 'any men I could hel' to lead a normal li'e!\" The prospect let his exhaustion fade. \"I thank Mr. De'eraux loud and clear 'or his generosity to 'und this 'roject! He 'ont deny his su'ort, Claire, or he'll loose his 'ace in quite another 'ay!\" \"I help you,\" she promised and wiped the tears from her cheeks. \"Whatever it might take! I even know someone from CNN… a friend of a friend. If he's back from Washington, then…\" \"You 'ust go 'ack, Claire. You can't stay here. Your 'arents 'ill initiate a search 'or you; they'll think I kidna'ed you.\" \"So I call Jenna and let her know where I am. Tell her to inform Mom and Dad.\" The young woman was that angry and disappointed her parents had taken refuge to such intrigues. She did not want to talk to them herself. Right now she was not sure if she ever wanted to talk to them again! No way would she leave! He enjoyed resting in her arms. I've never thought I could feel this again… I've never thought I could have this again… Suddenly, everything seemed possible. === Two weeks later / Bay Ridge / Claire's home === \"… artificial skin on the base of own tissue, with perfect cellular bonding on molecular scale. For it had been impossible until now to create samples with sufficient UV-resistance outside of lab conditions, this discovery is the most promising fact in this research. I'm sure we will have applicable results within the next year, thanks to the generosity of Mr. Frank Deveraux, who kindly –\" Anna Deveraux switched the TV off and sighed. \"I still cannot believe how this man is able to extort the money and blackmail you, Frank!\" she said, turning to her husband. \"After all we wanted to do for him so he could live a decent life! It is exactly as my mother said: give a man a hand, and he wants all you have!\" Frank Deveraux did not answer. He was a passionate chess player. He had thought to get Peyton Westlake out of his daughter's life with a simple move. Just wave with a buck in front of a poor man's nose and he'll do everything! However, he had to admit now a total misjudgment of the situation and his 'opponents', including Claire. The stubborn little girl had grown up into a very determined young woman, while he was sitting in his office. A woman who did not need his guidance anymore… when this had happened? He could not imagine; it seemed only yesterday he drove her to first grade school. And this Westlake? Well, if the situation would be another, he would've admired the man for his endurance and determination. \"Frank, what do we do now?\" \"What we do?\" He went to the house bar - a way he had taken often lately. \"I cannot go and shoot him, can I? We have to arrange with the situation. Everything else would be bad publicity. Senator Beckman would freeze his support, and this, I assure you, the President wouldn't find amusing at all!\" He filled a glass with Tequila. \"This was a very smart move from Westlake. I can only use it to my advantage, or I loose. More than our daughter!\" \"But Frank! Our little baby! What if he –\" \"It's Claire's decision.\" Frank Deveraux emptied the glass. \"And for now he hasn't done anything of your nightmares. Neither mistreated nor kidnapped her, not even asked her for huge sums of money.\" \"This sounds as if you give a damn about your daughter in the hands of a… a… a psycho freak!\" The evening ended in dissent. === Medical Department of the \"Columbia\" === Robert Collins, Dean of the Medical Department, handed out a folder with the appointment papers to the man standing in front of him. \"Dr. Westlake, this was a… uhm… hazardous adventure, I may say; calling a press conference without anyone's knowledge here at the Department! You got us funding for the next years, though… if you weren't as brilliant as I know you are…\" He left the rest suspended and took Peyton's hand. \"Welcome back!\" … The first weeks became very difficult for Westlake. He was not used anymore to work with other people, despite his wishes all those years to do so again. It frustrated him to repeat again and again what he wanted, because the others didn't understand his speech. And he sensed the uneasiness his colleagues felt in his presence. They tried hiding it, and some did a better job than others. However he could discern they didn't want to express their pity aloud, but couldn't manage to treat him normally, too. Some even felt uncomfortable being alone with him, as if the subject of conversation would suddenly change in a direction they did not want and then there would be no escape. Appointed head of this project or not, he rested a freak at the edge of the normal life. Sometimes he needed all his effort to control threatening outbursts of rage. It went too slow! Why it went that slow? Who had typed in the wrong set of numbers at the sequencer? Who had forgotten to turn off the lights and thus killed the sensitive cultures? Why the new material from New Zealand hadn't arrived yet? The progress the team made was smaller than expected, even though Peyton worked double shifts himself. On another front he had to arrange with the facts, too. A neurological expert had told him he would never regain complete sensitivity again. It was a rare development that some parts of his spinothalamic tract obviously had 'reconnected' themselves. A 'wonder' happening once in a million. But he couldn't hope for much more. It seemed a part of him would stay the Darkman forever. Claire had rented an apartment, until he had enough money from advance payments for a small house in New Jersey, where the pets could stay in the little garden. She was wonderful, the greatest gift of all. In the beginning, she had helped him cleaning the mess in the underground, to repair his equipment. She had arranged the press conference in using God knows which contacts. She was there, when he came home late at night; she was always there with her warmth and strength. But the months passed by without the final result he wanted, and he was getting afraid of loosing her. She said she would wait… but how long? And he did not want to wait either. He wanted to really love her, with whole body and soul, not only dream… He opened the little box with the engagement ring he had bought already weeks ago, and stared at the jewelry again. \"…Don't you want to go home today?\" Peyton looked up and saw Hendrik Reinitzer standing in the door of the office. He had been the one feeling the most discomfort in the beginning and had been ready to quit the project, until the Dean spoke to him. Meanwhile the German scientist had become the closest equivalent to a friend Westlake could have under the circumstances. \"I'm not 'inished yet.\" \"It's past 2 am, you know, and you are here since 8 am yesterday. You can check the results of the tests if you come back after some hours of sleep.\" Westlake stared at the ring again as if the other man was not in the room anymore. \"Peyton, I lost my wife due to these damned night shifts,\" Reinitzer continued. \"I always thought, only some minutes more, only one hour, only one test – and one night I came home and she was gone, leaving me a note she don't want to be married to a phone saying 'I'll be late'.\" You lost your wife, but I will never have one, if I won't be successful! Don't you understand? He left the words unspoken and had his gaze still fixed on the jewelry. The jewelry. The crystal structure. The structure… Westlake jumped from his seat and nearly pushed Reinitzer aside. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to upset-\" \"I need the sam'les from test line 256 – B!\" Hendrik Reinitzer tried to collect himself and to adjust to the sudden change of subject, while his colleague ran past him into the laboratory. The place was empty at this hour; they were the only two people still working. But within the next minutes, it became as busy here as if the whole staff was on duty. === Next night / New Jersey === The sun was setting and Claire looked out of the window, watching the cats coming to their feeding place in the garden and waiting for Peyton either to arrive or to call. He hadn't been home for two days now, and she began worrying. Of course, she knew how he buried himself in his work, she knew how determined and stubborn he could be – he had to be. She didn't reprimand this, but she was worried. The more she was longing for him, the rarer he was at home at all. Claire had met her father once since she moved out of the house of her parents; at an official date concerning the 'kind donation' for the Medical Department. They hadn't talked much, however the young woman had the impression Frank Deveraux searched a way to say sorry without giving up too much. She didn't know how to react. If he didn't say at least a little word, she couldn't move on as if nothing had happened! Concerning her mother, Claire only knew she refused to see her. Jenna had told her to have heard Anna Deveraux saying she did not want to watch her 'little baby withering away' and 'locked up in solitude'. Her mother didn't understand anything. Claire began to wonder, if she had ever tried to understand. As for the solitude… well, she had been to some invitations by Jenna or other friends, but she had discovered she had not much in common with them anymore. The time when she hang out in the scene-clubs with them and went shopping in the expensive lanes seemed that far away! Did she regret it? No, she answered herself. And the opinions of her family or some of her acquaintances did not interest her. She sensed a cold wet nose in her hand and padded Jerky. Time for his little evening workout! The dog answered with a happy barking. … Somewhat before midnight, Claire had fallen asleep a book in her hands and still waiting for a call from the laboratory. She dreamt of a walk on the beach and deep kisses in the sunset… Slowly she woke up, pulled by the gentle touch of lips not belonging to the hazy realm of fantasies, but to reality. Opening her eyes, and blinking against the light, she discovered Peyton kneeling at her side. His face was whole and unmarred, with that smile she loved so much. She reached out and followed his traits with her hand, just to make sure it was reality. \"You've made it! This is so… amazing!\" He kissed her again. \"I worked on it for the last two days and nights. A simple molecular bridge was all that was still missing, but I had to find it!\" \"You didn't say a word you were that close!\" \"I wanted it to be a surprise. … Claire, Claire, my love…\" For a long moment, they just rested there, arms put around each other. Then he took the little box with the ring out of his pocket and opened it. He had waited so long, he had imagined this moment for so long. But now he nearly stumbled over the words, though, and had the impression to sound like a stupid schoolboy. \"Claire… do you want… to marry me?\" \"I will,\" she whispered, \"of course I will!\" He put the ring onto her finger, and they both radiated with joy. The dream had finally broken through into the reality, and spread its light all over the remnants of darkness. \"So, search something gorgeous to dress in; we will go out!\" \"Uh – whereto?\" \"Anywhere you want, and as long as you want!\" ...THE END... (Well, I hope, this ending is romantic enough….) ","Summary":" (Disclaimer: Original Darkman character setting is not my own, but Sam Raimi's. However, this story"}]
