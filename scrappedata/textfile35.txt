Qu'est-ce qu'ils étaient venus faire dans cette galère ? Non, mais vraiment il y avait de quoi à se poser la question ! Et pourtant... Ce texte a été écrit dans le cadre des Nuits du FoF sur le thème \"Galère\". (Rappel des règles : 1 thème pour une 1 heure entre 21h et 4h du matin) Non mais cette première Nuit de 2019 c'est un grand n'importe quoi, voilà donc une idée impromptue et improbable sur ... Ben le film que j'ai regardé hier soir en fait... Franchement, c'est de votre faute tout ça ;) En espérant que cela vous plaise Bonne lecture PS : Au fait j'ai commencé à faire du tri et à remettre de l'ordre dans mes publications en faisant une sorte de table des matières dans mon profil alors n'hésitez pas à y faire un tour ;) . Qu'est-ce qu'ils étaient venus faire dans cette galère ? Qu'est-ce qu'il était venu faire dans cette galère ? C'était précisément la question que se posait Korben Dallas alors qu'il se trouvait dans ce temple égyptien devant l'une de ses maudites pierres. De toute manière, il aurait dû comprendre que tout cela allait se terminer n'importe comment dés les premiers instants : quand elle était passée à travers le toit de son taxi, quand la police avait essayé de les arrêter, quand le prêtre s'était évanoui en voyant son tatouage, quand l'armée s'était mêlée de tout ça, quand il y avait eu cette bombe… Oui, de toute manière ça ne pouvait que finir de cette manière ! Dans un grand n'importe quoi ! Un grand n'importe quoi dans lequel il tentait de sauver le Monde du Mal Absolu et de la Destruction Finale avec quatre monolithe gravé et une jeune femme qui malgré son apparence n'avait que quelques jours de vie, agissant par moment avec des attitudes naïves mais charmante. Oui, chercher à ouvrir une pierre avait vraiment l'air parfaitement ridicule ! Pourtant, au vue des événements qui étaient en train de se dérouler, il n'avait pas de doute à avoir. C'était ça ou mourir avec toute l'Humanité ! Qu'est-ce qu'il était venu faire dans cette galère ? Le père Vito Cornelius ne pouvait s'empêcher de se poser la question même s'il connaissait parfaitement la réponse. Il était le Gardien de la porte du temple. Il connaissait tous les secrets et l'ampleur de la mission dés le départ. Il savait ce qui les attendait. Il avait vite fait le calcul quand son prédécesseur lui avait donné la clé, ce combat serrait pour lui. Ce combat qu'ils attendaient tous depuis plus de 300 ans, elle allait lui incomber. Alors il l'avait attendu avec une certaine angoisse, espérant être à la hauteur de la tâche. De toute manière, il n'avait pas le droit à l'échec. Si jamais il avait une défaillance, tout l'Univers en paierait le prix. C'était donc une vraie galère, mais une galère programmée ! Enfin, programmée, il fallait le dire vite. S'il faisait la liste la plupart des péripéties qu'il venait de traverser n'était pas du tout prévu au programme ! L'explosion du vaisseau, l'ingérence chronique de cet agaçant chauffeur de taxi, l'intervention de ce financier totalement mégalo, c'était des choses qu'il était loin d'avoir prévu, mais des choses qui avait contribué à l'augmentation de la galère dans laquelle il se trouvait à ce moment précis alors que le Mal Absolu n'avait jamais été aussi proche ! Qu'est-ce qu'il était venu faire dans cette galère ? Cette phrase ne cessait de tourner dans la tête du jeune David pendant qu'il se trouvait-là, tremblant comme une feuille devant cette pierre qui était censée s'ouvrir mais qui ne voulait pas bouger d'un centimètre. Il n'avait jamais vraiment demandé à se trouver là lui. Oh bien sûr quand il avait rejoint Cornélius pour qu'il l'éduque et lui apprenne le sens de leur mission, il avait compris que ces événements terribles devaient se passer pendant qu'il était à ses côtés. Mais, benoîtement, il s'était dit qu'il n'aurait qu'un rôle d'assistant et que son maître aller tout régler en trois coups de cuillères à pot. Sauf que c'était loin d'être le cas ! Tout avait été trop vite, lui faisant perdre son peu de confiance en lui et il avait compris qu'il n'avait pas les épaules pour ce genre d'aventures ! Et le Mal Absolu qui se rapprochait de plus en plus, prêt à les engloutir ! Oui, il se demandait réellement ce qu'il était venu faire dans cette galère et une pensée fugace traversa son esprit, une pensée qu'il exprima dans un grand soupir « on n'y arrivera jamais »… Et la pierre se mit à bouger. Qu'est-ce qu'il était venu faire dans cette galère ? Non, mais c'était vrai ! Ce n'était pas sa place ! Ruby Rhodes était une star du show-bizz international ! Une star de la radio qu'on écoutait tous les soirs en étant au bord de la crise d'hystérie. Une star dont la seule apparition faisait tomber les femmes de toutes espèces dans les pommes ! Il n'avait rien d'un aventurier ! Les flingues, les explosions, la fin du monde c'était très loin de ses préoccupations, qui tournaient essentiellement, il fallait bien le dire, autour de sa petite personne ! Il aurait dû le comprendre pourtant en voyant ce type baraqué avec ses deux mots de vocabulaire qu'il n'allait lui entraîner que des problèmes. Bon, il lui avait aussi permis de faire l'émission de sa vie, mais là c'était autre chose ! Il était dans la galère ultime ! Il se trouvait devant une pierre qu'il devait ouvrir et il n'avait pas de feu ! Non mais c'était vraiment le bon jour pour arrêter de fumer ! Ce n'était vraiment pas une idée green ! Et il n'avait vraiment pas envie de mourir ! Oh non ! Pas aujourd'hui ! Il était bien trop … Il lui fallait du feu ! Qu'est-ce qu'ils étaient venus faire dans cette galère ? Aucun d'eux ne le savait vraiment, sauf que pour le coup, s'ils n'arrivaient pas à surnager tout le monde sombrerait avec eux… C'était le moment de trouver des rames et de sauver l'univers… ","Summary":" Je ne possède aucun des personnages des films.

Je l'ai écrit il y a longtemps, mais je ne sais pas pourquoi je ne l'ai jamais posté : c'est l'une de ces fics qui m'ont satisfaites dès leur premier jet. J'ai toujours eu cette idée que la Diva Plavalaguna était une télépathe, alors tous les textes écrits *comme ça* sont des messages télépathiques. Bref, juste pour vous dire ce que je ressens. Le Cinquième Elément ne m'appartient pas, ni le film ni ses personnages. Je ne me fais pas d'argent de poche en écrivant cela et je n'ai pas d'argent pour être trainée en justice. Laissez-moi donc tranquille. Elle arrivait, Leeloo pouvait le sentir. La diva avait tendance à affecter les gens de manière étrange, mais pour Leeloo, c'était une présence calme et rassurante. Une influence stable au milieu du chaos qui l'entourait et la chamboulait. Il n'y avait rien que de la beauté chez Plavalaguna et elle rappelait toujours à Leeloo qu'elle avait été créée pour protéger. *Je suis soulagée que vous soyez saine et sauve* La gentille voix de la diva semblait faire écho dans sa tête. Les mots étaient dans l'ancienne langue, pas l'Anglais que Leeloo avait rapidement appris ou la langue natale de la diva. *Les nouvelles de l'attaque m'ont apeurée. Tout est sans avenir si vous êtes perdue* La secrétaire de la diva s'approcha du coin de mur près duquel se trouvait Leeloo. Elle parla à voix basse, faisant attention à ne pas qu'on la remarque. \"La diva est ravie que vous soyez là. Elle vous donnera ce pour quoi vous êtes venu après le concert. Attendez là.\" *Je sais qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de temps. Mais il en reste encore un peu* Elle ne savait pas de quelle espèce était Plavalaguna, seulement qu'elle n'était pas de la Terre. Mais les Mondoshiwan lui faisaient confiance et la respectaient, et c'était suffisant pour Leeloo pour aussi lui faire confiance. Elle protègera les pierres jusqu'à ce que Leeloo, le prêtre Cornelius et ses gardiens Mondoshiwan les récupèrent. Le Mal était un ennemi rusé et avait essayé plus d'une fois d'arrêter la Lumière de Création. On ne pouvait que craindre quels seraient ses agissements cette fois. A part ça, les Mondoshiwan étaient de l'avis que moins longtemps les pierres restaient sur Terre, mieux le monde se portait. Ils n'apprenaient pas de leurs erreurs, pouvaient faire des choses vraiment stupides et paniquaient facilement, ce que les Gardiens avaient appris la dernière fois qu'ils étaient venus chercher les Eléments il y a trois cent ans de cela. La réunion avec la magnifique chanteuse avait été très sobre. Elle avait accepté de prendre soin des pierres et de les protéger. Leeloo ne savait pas pourquoi, mais elle semblait très triste à la fin. \"Je ne sais pas où je serai quand la crise arrivera, mais je planifierai un concert quand l'heure sera venue. Vous serez capable de me trouver.\" Elle avait commencé à partir et avait marqué un temps, avant de se tourner vers Leeloo. \"Je pense que ce sera mon dernier.\" Désormais Leeloo savait ce qu'elle avait voulu dire, il y a bien longtemps. Et elle voulait pleurer, protester, insister que c'était contre sa nature de permettre une telle chose. *Ne faites pas mon deuil. Si quelqu'un doit mourir pour que tous vivent, je ferai avec joie ce sacrifice. J'ai pris cette décision* Leeloo voulait crier que tant étaient déjà morts et que la beauté et l'innocence de la diva étaient ce pour quoi Leeloo avait été littéralement créée pour protéger. Mais elle garda le silence. Cacher les pierres était tout ce qui importait dorénavant. *Toute chose meurt, tôt ou tard. La vie sans la mort est autant contre-nature que la mort sans la vie. J'ai vécu, et c'est l'heure pour moi de mourir. Mais nous avons toujours un petit peu de temps. Et j'aimerais chanter une dernière fois* Ce doux murmure mental lui était parvenu alors que la diva était escorté vers la salle de concert. Et tandis que les premières notes du concert d'adieu de la diva Plavalaguna résonnaient dans les enceintes du bateau, Leeloo ne put pas s'empêcher de pleurer.

Spoilers: This spoils the wholenmovie as it touches on events that happened throughout. -- The Long Afterglow There are 400 words innthe divine language only I am allowed to speak. There are roughly an100,000 currently in use by the humans I live with. Corbin has a vocabularynof about 3,000, better than most human's I have encountered. These 100,000 words arenused to code me, to pull me into the anonymous face of humanity. Inlook human, I act human now, better than I did when I first arrived,nand I speak using these human words almost exclusively. I carry a human name onnmy tongue, Leeloo and my thoughts have slowed to a human's level. Instill instinctively process everything I see, hear, touch, smell andntaste at a speed twenty times a normal human's. Father Cornelius saysnit reminds him of a sparrow. I have never seen one in New York City. Corbin says it remindsnhim of a first time driver in the streets trying desperately to avoidnthe lazily hazardous driving of a cab driver. This I've seenncountless times. In two years I havenlearned approximately 3,194 of the currently spoken human dialects. I have met Corbin's mother once when I first moved into hisnapartment. I like his cat more. I still like his cat,nher soft coat shimmering under my fingers, her voice loud andndiscordant and rough on my tongue. During the day I go tonFather Cornelius' to study, or I stay at the apartment with thencat, or when Corbin isn't looking, or pretending to look the othernway while giving me a smirk I jump from buildings in the tall city,nnavigating and learning first hand all the steel and plastic shapes. It took Corbin anyear-and-a-half to accept that I do this, I don't think he'llnever understand this behavior he calls suicidal, but he accepts. I look human, but I amnstronger, faster, more agile, and more resilient. My arms can supportnthe quick grabbing of a ledge after plummeting several storiesnwithout tearing out of my shoulder sockets. Children, please do notntry this at home. There is a legendnforming in this city, though how a legend exists after only sixnmonths I still have problems understanding, but there is a legend ofna mysterious woman who jumps from buildings and stops crime. I only kicked him innthe face twice, my foot arching over my head and connecting under hisnchin and then descending onto the top of his skull. It was accidentalnthat I landed on the floor of a building with a robbery in progressnin an apartment. The kicks were not accidental. I meant them, swiftnand sure, my eyes and nose and hearing analyzing and assessing thensituation in twenty seconds. That night there was annews story about an orange haired woman flipping into an airlock andnknocking out a would-be robber before jumping back out. I squirmed anlittle next to Corbin and tried to smile with my head tilted in thenprecise angle he likes me to use when he wants me to act cutely sly. He looked bewilderednand then chastising and then smiling at me. I used the opportunitynto push him onto the fresh plastic covering on our bed and let whatnhe calls nature, take its course. I like those games withnCorbin, where he can act the stern, grizzled protector figure and Inthe whimsical, yet naughty young woman. I don't think he'snconsciously recognized yet that he needs that, or that he enjoys thenbyplay. Corbin told me early on that I have lived with him longnenough and learned enough common sense to make my own decisions. The robbery stoppingnhas since been repeated several times. Always accidental, usuallynending with torn plastic and sweaty bodies after my blurred image hasnappeared on the television. We never fight, exceptnwhen it comes to the military. And then he fights withnthe Colonels and Generals and even the President a time or two and Instand behind him with a slightly vacant expression on my face. Corbin wants me to benperfect, and gentle and strong and womanly. He wants me to go out andnlearn and adapt and be and also to stay home and hold him and lovenhim and touch him as a woman does. He liked my innocence, which isnperpetually recycled as I discover another new interesting facet ofnthe various human cultures that seethe and melt on this planet, butnhe also wants me to be worldly. He wants to protect menand to have me be able to protect myself, though he'd rather I wasnable to kick a would-be robber out cold or use a gun to defend myselfnand our property then go out and stop a terrorist occupation innanother galaxy. Father Cornelius justndoesn't want me dirtied not after I've completed my duty. Thenidea of doing anything more than having tea with him and talkingnabout the divine language is practically sacrilegious, almost as if Inshould be locked into a case and put on display with a placardnreading: This is the FifthnElement. She saved our world, a lot. She also likes roast chicken. The creation of ansecond moon has sent the tidal waves of the planet seething andnchurning. It has caused increased seismic fluctuations andninstability that scientists are attempting to correct for. There is still argumentnover what they should name the second moon, right now most peoplencall it Second, Corbin calls it an eyesore, and I call it enemy and anreminder of my duty and position. I am a prophecy thatnhas fulfilled her duty and is now supposed to quietly assimilate intonthe populous around me and be ignored. People wouldn't want dailynreminders of how close they got to dying. Already the second moon isnjust another moon and some have chosen to walk blind, claiming it wasnalways there. Sometimes being blindnseems to be easier than accepting the hairbreadth distance death wasnfor these humans I live with. Sometimes living blindnas I do, molding myself to fit the image of what a perfect woman isnin Corbin's eyes is the easiest as well, but when the Mondoshawanncome for me in another few years I will leave him as that is my duty.nI know that this will ruin Corbin, watching me step off thisnpedestal, and it will devastate Father Cornelius who always expectednto be a gently guiding hand, at least through the rest of hisnlifetime. I will return to spacenand sleep for five millennia and chew on the memories of thisnlifetime in my dreams as I have done in times past for other culturesnthat have risen and fallen, for other species that believe in thenFive Elements, in the struggle of Light and Dark and I will wait fornmy enemy to return. And slowly, very slowlynI will process and break down the images of my time here and myntongue will return to the 400 words of the divine language and I willnbe whole and blank, waiting to be coded with the experiences of a newngeneration.

La enfermera se le acercó al ya sacerdote David y le susurró –No le queda mucho, es mejor que se despida- -Iré por Minai para que te vea, sé que tu hija siempre te ha alegrado – Trató de levantarse pero Dallas le tomó su túnica. -Trae a Leeloo por favor, sólo quiero despedirme de ella – el ruego que se veía en los ojos del ex militar hicieron que David sospechara de todo lo que sabía. Minai entró a la habitación y tomó las manos de su padre entre las propias, sus ojos eran la fiel copia de su madre, aunque con el cabello de su padre. -Papá, luces mejor hoy – la chica le brindó una sonrisa y depositó un beso cálido en su frente. -Nunca has sido buena para mentir cariño – el ex militar sonrió a su hija. -David me dijo que hablaste de mamá…no lo hiciste en años – La chica se veía confundida – hay tantas cosas que quisiera saber de ella. -Siempre queriendo aprender, igual que Leeloo. Me recuerdas tanto a ella que duele. Sobre todo cuando te veo a los ojos, tienes los mismos ojos de tu madre– una lágrima se deslizó silenciosa por su mejilla. -Papá… ¿es cierto que ella está viva? – Korben había guardado silencio por tantos años. Ya era tiempo de decir la verdad, al menos eso merecía su hija. -Sabes que apenas vi a tu madre me enamoré de ella, ella simplemente era perfecta, y no lo digo porque era un ser supremo, lo digo porque es la verdad. Después de salvar al mundo comenzamos una hermosa relación que duró años, hasta que llegó tu hermano Vito. Ella se enamoró de él en el instante que supo que estaba embarazada, era una experiencia que jamás pensó tener, sin embargo estaba pasando. Es cierto que los Mondoshawan no estuvieron de acuerdo con ello, pues temían que el pequeño fuera utilizado por la humanidad como un arma, por lo mismo decidimos retirarnos de la palestra pública e iniciar una vida anónima como el señor y la señora Dallas – se ahogó, su hija no supo decir si fue por su delicado estado de salud, o por revelar el secreto que llevaba consigo tantos años. -Tranquilo papá, tómate tu tiempo -Siempre pensé que tendría más tiempo, ahora que se está acabando quiero que lo sepas todo. Bien, después de que nació Vito ambos pensamos que no podríamos ser más felices, fue una bendición que abarcaba más de lo que nos imaginábamos. De haber sabido lo que ocurriría habría actuado diferente…bien, Tres años después llegaste tu, y debo decir que la maternidad le sentaba de manera preciosa a tu madre, se veía radiante todo el tiempo, con una sonrisa en su rostro y ese brillo de felicidad en su mirada…sus ojos…¿te había dicho que tienes los ojos de tu madre? -Sólo todo el tiempo. -Cierto…bien, pensábamos que nada podía salir mal y ahí fue cuando bajamos nuestra guardia, el peor error de nuestras vidas. Los mangalores jamás dejaron de investigarnos, siempre estuvieron al tanto de nosotros, sólo esperaban el instante propicio de atacar. Y lo hicieron. Llegaron en la noche, sabían quién era Leeloo y el potencial que tendrían sus hijos. Salimos a enfrentarlos, pero no nos dimos cuenta de que Vito nos había seguido, vino con una pistola de juguete para protegerte…el te amaba tanto, a pesar de ser sólo un niño. Matamos a muchos mangalores, pero siempre venían más, estábamos siendo superados en número y de un momento a otro lo tomaron. La cara de horror de tu madre me destrozó el alma, trató en vano de recuperarlo, pero nos superaban en número…estaban en su nave y ella me miró, sollozando –\"No puedo dejar que se lo lleven, nadie puede utilizarlo como a mi\" – y tras decir estas palabras el mismo rayo que antaño nos había salvado la vida, se la arrebataba a nuestro hijo y al resto de los alienígenas.- Miró a su hija, estaba llorando. Las lágrimas hacían que sus ojos se vieran más claros de lo que eran. -Ella no pudo soportarlo, matar a su hijo la destrozó de una manera inimaginable…era un ser supremo, pero aún así presenciar y ser la causante de la muerte de su primogénito la destruyó. Me dijo que necesitaba estar sola, que buscaría apoyo en los Mondoshawan y que luego volvería por nosotros, pero eso no ocurrió. Pensé que podría despedirme de ella pero la vida me está dejando…- -¿por qué esperar todo este tiempo para contarme?- -Porque ahora que ya no voy a estar, y si regresa debe ser a un lugar en el que la estén esperando, no te pido que perdones a tu madre por dejarnos, ni que disculpes el secreto que he guardado durante tanto tiempo…sólo quiero que seas amable con ella…es tan….frá...gil- Sus palabras se fueron ahogando poco a poco y la máquina a la que estaba conectado comenzó a sonar insistentemente.

Il y a environ 100 000 mots que les humains avec lesquels je vis utilisent. Corbin a un vocabulaire d'a peu près 3 000, mieux que celui de la plupart des humains que j'ai rencontré. Ces 100 000 mots ont été utilisés pour m'encoder, pour me pousser dans l'anonymat de l'humanité. Je parais humain, je bouge comme un humain désormais, mieux que lorsque je suis arrivée, et je parle en utilisant presque que des mots humains. Je porte un nom humain sur ma langue, Leeloo et mes pensées ont ralentis à un niveau humain. Je traite toujours tout ce que je vois, j'entends, je touche, je sens et je goûte à une vitesse vingt fois supérieure à celle d'un humain normal. Le Père Cornélius dit que ça lui rappelle un moineau. Je n'en ai jamais vu à New York City. Corbin dit que ça lui rappelle un chauffeur en herbe lâché dans les rues qui essaye désespéramment d'éviter les chahuts causés par la conduite d'un chauffeur de taxi. Ça je l'ai vu plein de fois. En deux ans j'ai appris grosso modo 3 194 dialectes humains en usage. J'ai rencontré la mère de Corbin une fois quand j'ai emménagé dans son appartement. Je préfère son chat. J'aime toujours son chat, sa peau douce brillant sous mes doigts, sa voix râpeuse et gauche sur ma langue. Pendant la journée je vais chez le Père Cornélius pour étudier ou je reste à l'appartement avec le chat, ou quand Corbin ne regarde pas ou fait semblant de regarder ailleurs en m'adressant un sourire en coin je saute de bâtiments en bâtiments dans la grande ville, navigant et apprenant de première main toutes les structures. Il avait fallu à Corbin un an et demi pour accepter que je fasse ça, je ne pense pas qu'il comprendra un jour cette pratique qu'il trouve suicidaire, mais il l'accepte. Je parais humaine mais je suis plus forte, plus rapide, plus agile et plus résistante. Mes bras peuvent endurer la saisie rapide d'un rebord après être tombée de plusieurs étages sans se déboîter. Les enfants, ne refaites pas ça à la maison. Il y a une légende qui se forme en ville, bien que comment une légende peut-elle se former après tout juste six moins je ne sais pas, mais il y a une légende à propos d'une mystérieuse femme qui saute de bâtiments en bâtiments et arrête les criminels. Je lui ai juste donné deux coups de pied dans la tête une fois, mon pied passant au-dessus de ma tête et le touchant sous le menton et puis par-dessus le haut de son crâne vers le bas. C'était accidentel que j'atterrisse sur un bâtiment où un cambriolage faisait rage. Les coups de pied n'étaient pas accidentels. Je voulais faire mal, mes yeux, mon nez et mon ouïe analysant et évaluant la situation en vingt secondes. Cette nuit-là il y a une histoire dans le journal à propos d'une femme aux cheveux orange qui saute partout et a terrassé un cambrioleur avant de s'enfuir. Je tique un peu à côté de Corbin et essaye de sourire avec ma tête penchée dans l'angle précis qu'il aime bien que j'utilise quand je veux paraître sournoise. Il avait l'air incrédule puis mécontent avant de me sourire. J'ai saisi l'opportunité de le pousser contre la couverture en plastique de notre lit et de laisser ce qu'il appelle la Nature prendre son cours. J'aime ces jeux avec Corbin, où il peut agir en figure paternelle et protectrice un peu bourru et moi en jeune femme coquine et fantasque. Je ne pense pas qu'il a réalisé consciencieusement qu'il a besoin de ça ou qu'il aime cette idée. Corbin m'a dit au début que j'avais vécu assez longtemps avec lui et appris assez de bon sens pour prendre mes propres décisions. L'incident du cambriolage a depuis été réitéré plusieurs fois. Toujours accidentel, se finissant habituellement avec du plastique fendu et des corps en sueur après que mon image floue soit passée à la télé. Nous ne nous battons jamais, sauf en ce qui concerne les militaires. Et alors il se bat avec les Colonels et les Généraux et même avec le Président une fois ou deux et je me tiens derrière lui avec une expression absente sur le visage. Corbin veut que je sois parfaite et gentille et forte et féminine. Il veut que je sorte et apprenne et m'adapte ainsi que je reste à la maison et le tienne et l'aime et le touche comme une femme. Il a aimé mon innocence qui est perpétuellement recyclée alors que je découvre un autre fait intéressant sur les diverses cultures humaines qui composent cette planète mais il me veut aussi mondaine. Il veut me protéger et que je sois capable de prendre soin de moi, bien qu'il préfère que je terrasse à moi toute seule un cambrioleur ou même utilise un flingue pour nous défendre moi et notre propriété plutôt que de sortir arrêter une occupation terroriste dans la galaxie voisine. Le Père Cornélius veut encore moi que je fasse quoi que ce soit maintenant que ma tâche est remplie. L'idée de faire autre chose que de prendre une tasse de thé en sa compagnie et de parler de la langue divine est presque un sacrilège, comme s'il voulait me mettre dans une vitrine et m'afficher avec une étiquette portant les mots : C'est le Cinquième Élément. Elle a sauvé notre monde, très important. Elle aime aussi le poulet rôti. La création d'une deuxième lune a envoyé des lames de fond sur la planète qui la bousculent. Ça a causé d'incroyable fluctuations sismiques et instabilités territoriales que les scientifiques ont encore du mal à appréhender. Il y a toujours des discussions sur le nom qu'ils devraient donner à la deuxième lune, pour le moment les gens l'appelle La Deuxième, Corbin l'appelle une horreur et je l'appelle l'ennemi et un rappel de mon devoir et de ma position. Je suis une prophétie qui a rempli son devoir et doit maintenant visiblement s'adapter au monde autour de moi et être ignorée. Les gens ne veulent pas des rappels quotidiens de la mort qu'ils ont frôlés. Déjà la deuxième lune n'est juste qu'une autre lune et certains ont décidés de marcher dans le noir, clamant que ça avait toujours été là. Parfois marcher dans le noir semble être plus facile que d'accepter la distance ridicule qui séparait les humains avec lesquels je vis de la mort. Parfois vivre dans le noir comme je le fais, se mouler pour ressembler à la femme parfaite dans les yeux de Corbin est la solution la plus facile aussi, mais quand les Mondoshawan viendront pour moi dans quelques années je le quitterai comme cela est ma tâche. Je sais que ça ruinera Corbin, de me regarder quitter ce piédestal, et que ça dévastera le Père Cornélius, qui s'attend toujours à ce que je sois une guide affable, du moins pour le reste de son existence à lui. Je retournerai dans l'espace et dormirai pour cinq millénaires et mâchonnerai sur les souvenirs de cette vie dans mes rêves comme je l'ai fait par le passé pour d'autres cultures qui se sont élevées et ont périclité, pour d'autres espèces qui ont cru aux Cinq Eléments, dans la bataille de la Lumière contre les Ténèbres et j'attendrai pour mon ennemi de revenir.

The diva tended to affect mostnpeople rather oddly, but to Leeloo, she was a calming, gentlenpresence. A stable influence in the middle of the chaos thatnsurrounded and confused her. There was nothing but beauty innPlavalaguna, and she always reminded Leeloo what she had been creatednto protect. :Inam glad you are safe.: The diva's gentle voice seemed to echo in her mind. The words werenin the old language, not the English that Leeloo had been rapidlynlearning or the diva's own native language. :Thennews of the attack frightened me. All is for nothing if you arenlost.: Thendiva's secretary approached the corner Leeloo was standing near. Shenspoke in a low voice, being careful to not appear to do so. \"Thendiva is pleased that you are here. She will give you what you havencome for, after the concert. Wait here.\" :Inknow that time is short. But there is still a little left.: Shenhadn't known what species Plavalaguna was, only that she was not ofnEarth. But the Mondoshiwan trusted and respected her, and that wasnenough for Leeloo to trust her as well. She would keep the stonesnsafe until Leeloo, the priest Cornelius, and her Mondoshiwannguardians could collect them. The Evil was a cunning foe, and hadntried to stop the Light of Creation more than once. There was nontelling what it would do this time. Thatnaside, the Mondoshiwan were of the opinion that the less time thenstones spent on Earth, the better off everyone would be. They didnnot learn from their mistakes, and could panic very easily and donremarkably stupid things, as the guardians had learned when they hadnretrieved the stones for safe keeping three hundred years before. Thenmeeting with the beautiful singer had been very somber. She hadnagreed to take charge of the stones and keep them safe. Leeloondidn't know why, but she seemed very sad at the end. \"I don'tnknow where I will be when the crisis comes, but I will schedule anconcert when it is time. You will be able to find me.\" She hadnstarted to leave, and had paused, looking back at Leeloo. \"Inthink it will be my last.\" NownLeeloo knew what she had meant, all that time ago. And she wanted toncry out, to protest, to insist that it was against her very nature tonallow it. :Donnot mourn me. If one must die so that all may live, I will happilynmake that sacrifice. I made this choice.: Leeloo wanted to shout that so many had died already and that thensame beauty and innocence in the diva was what Leeloo had literallynbeen made to protect. But she kept silent. Keeping the stonesnsecret and safe was all that mattered right now. :Everythingndies, sooner or later. Life without death is as unnatural as deathnwithout living. I have lived, and now it is my time to die. But wenstill have a little time left. And I would like to sing one lastntime.: That soft mental whisper had come as the diva was being escortednaway to the concert hall.

She had that way about her. Hey she was the Fifth element. But was. was the main word here. Years going by, they had a couple of kids, two to be exact, twins, one a girl and the other a boy, each looked like Leelu, and maybe had Corben's eyes. Was a pretty big surprise. After saving basically the human race, and then some about sixteen years ago, corben dallas was feeling old. Feeling too old. The president gave him the works, a new steady job, a nice place in the better side of the city, and a nice spot at a secluded tropic on vacations. So every thing was basically supposed to be peachie keen. Right? wrong, it was hell this last past year, Cal and Tera were the worst possible trouble makers he'd ever laid eyes on. \"What's it now, the twins are at school, and I'm eating.\" Leelu said voice low, almost an order. Corben sat down and changed the channel. Turning he saw Leelu drop the chiken and start yelling something in her own language. \"Penni do cha fulker bithie.\" She snapped. \"Baby I didn't know\" \"Don't you work today\" \"Yea but I can be alitt\" 'Go, Just go! get out of here\" And just like that Corben Dallas was thrown out by his own wife. Cursing Corben picked up the jacket Leelu had thrown at him and started down the hall. This had been the beginning of that day, the day he relized he was getting too old, and trouble would start. Tera took hold of Cal and pushed him back, her strenght twice Cal's. \"What the hell makes it right to embarace me in front of my friends, in front of my school!\" Tera snapped her long orange hair covering dark eyes, she was a small 5'4 with a body all her own, in every way she looked like her mother. And Cal was a tall 5'9, well built with red hair that matched his sisters for the exception he had dyed it a few times with no such luck. Anyone walking down the hallway would find it pretty odd to see a small petite girl nearly lifting Her two seconds older brother off the air. \"Hey I do what dad tell me, so keep your friggin cool!\" Cal snapped and fell feet flat on the ground. He fixed his collar and looked down at his sister. \"You told mom about your \" Problems\"?\" Cal raised an brow. Looking dead at Cal Tera crossed her arms over her chest and shrugged her shoulders. \"No\" \"Hey she went the same rought remember, maybe she cou\" \"NO! I can handle this, I mean come on it is pretty cool.\" Tera said smilling. \"Yeah until someone like me gets hurt\" \"I didn't hurt you now did I\" \"No---but\" \"Cool it, I got this all under control.\" Tera said and started walking down the hall way. But she was dead wrong, nothing could help the way she had been born, Not even Cal could sense the difference in his sister. \"Sorry to have to tell you the bad news but your daughter has been suspended.\" The principle of the highschool said to both Corban and Leelu who sat silently in shock. Cal was sitting in the corner of the office silently cursing himself. \"What the hell do you mean? what did she do?\" Corban snapped, Leelu touched his shoulder. \"Well more Mr Dallas, first off there was a big fight between her and one other student, which couldn't be stopped until blood shed, and a few broken walls.\" The principle went on. \"Wha? is Tera ok?\" Leelu bit in her eyes wide with relization. \"Oh she's quite alright, but the boy she fought has been transported to the hospital. with a few broken bones.\" The principle said frowning, Leelu held back the urge to chuckle. And Corban was looking down at Leelu with relization. \"For how long\" \"At first I wanted ten days, but since she's never gotten in trouble before, a week.\" \"Good we'll talk to her about today and make sure she'll never do it again.\" Corban went on trying to sound responisble. \"Great, nice meeting you both\" \"Likewise.\" \"Tera what in the hell were you thinking about! fighting, and why didn't you tell us about your problems.\" Corben snapped. Tera gave Cal a hard stare and shrugged. \"It's not a problem\" \"Yes it's a problem for us things happen when you are an \" \"Don't Corben.\" Leelu cut in a worried expression on her face.

At least he had come to this date without his entourage of assistants but he was still a blur of color, noise and constant movement. Their date went well. The dinner was perfect, the dessert divine and the drinks complimented the whole menu. Not that he would expect anything else given how much Ruby was shelling out for a table in this restaurant. But the whole time he was distracted. By Ruby's skin tight outfit and the wider than normal collar in a rich hunter green with blue-green leafs. Korben imagined getting the DJ out of his fabric shell while the man continued to talk. Suddenly a grin. \"So, I have a question.\" Ruby stopped talking. He was positively surprised.

The newspaper articles and interviews passednand faded into history, but the one thing that didn't change wasnKorbon's love for Leloo. Exactlynthree months after the whole ordeal Korbon kept his promise and tooknLeloo on a vacation, where they wed on a beach. A year after theirnwedding, Leloo gave birth to a baby girl, Alyx. Unlikenmost infants and babies that cried when they needed something, Alyxnwould wait patiently for her parents to give it to her. As timenpassed her blonde hair turned bright orange, like her mothers. Herneyes changed from brown to bright blue and her smile was soft. Shenwas almost an exact replica of her mother. Fivencandles flickered on Alyx's birthday cake. Leloo leaned in andnsmiled at her little girl. \"Wishnfor something baby.\" She said sweetly. \"Whatnshould I wish for?\" Alyx asked looking from her mother to hernfather. \"Wishnfor a pony!\" The annoying voice of their family friend Ruby Rodnsquawked from farther down the table. \"Wishnfor whatever you want.\" Korbon said smiling at his little girl.

In one of the busiest casinos every one stopped when a tall man with light colored hair and of course a tuxedo walked casually into the room. A chorus of exited whispers rippled through the crowd. \"That's Korben Dallas,\" whispered one exited girl to another as they watched his every move, \"he owns a dozen hotels here and on other planets too.\" Korben made his way across the room heading for one of the blackjack tables. He was still a bit mystified by all the attention that he got every time he walked into one of the casinos or just took a stroll along the decks. This wasn't the life that he was used to. Just five months ago he had been a middle class human with a military pension who was spending his honeymoon with his new wife Leeloo at one of these hotels. He had suddenly been called in and told that Byron Dallas the man who owned all these hotels was his great uncle one that he never knew that he had. He was told that his great uncle knew of him and who he was, but had been very sick and was too weak to make contact. He had heard of Korben's exploits in saving the world from the dark planet, and had left his entire Estate which included billions of dollars and an entire chain of luxury hotels and resorts. Here in the space of one day he had gone from middle class to one of the richest men in the Galaxy. He and Leeloo had moved to Fhloston and now lived in a penthouse of one of his hotels. Korben was no professional business man but he had common sense, and he was the same old down to earth guy and he treated everyone with respect and honesty including the hotel guests and they just loved his him and his hotels for it. The money just poured in until he literally would become a million dollars richer every five minutes. Whenever people asked him if he thought that inheriting that fortune was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him he would shake his head and say. \"The luckiest day of my life was when I met my beautiful wife Leeloo.\" Every time he called Leeloo his beautiful wife she would break into a wide grin right before she'd grab him and kiss him, so naturally he said it as often as he could. Of course no one could ever know the real story of Leeloo and Korben Dallas, besides who'd believe it anyway. Who'd believe that Leeloo was the fifth element a supreme being that had just fallen through the roof of Korben taxi and sent him on a whirlwind adventure to save the world? Well there were a few people who would believe. Vito Cornelius the Elemental Priest, the President and the general, and Ruby Rod the radio personality, but Ruby wouldn't talk he was close enough to being shipped of the loony bin as it was. \"Mr. Dallas?\" the voice of the young blackjack dealer brought Korben out of his musings. Korben smiled and the young man. \"Evening, Johnny,\" he said sliding into a stool at the table, \"Let's play cards.\" Ten minutes later Korben after winning ten straight hands looked up at Johnny and gave him a knowing look. \"Johnny,\" he said, \"will you start winning some of my money and knock off the butt kissing.\" \"Sir?\" said Johnny. \"Stop letting me win,\" said Korben exasperated, \"I don't like suck ups!\" Just then Korben felt two silky skinned arms go around his neck and squeeze him gently as a mess of unruly red-orange hair appeared before his right eye. Korben instantly broke into a smile and turned to see his wife Leeloo standing there wearing a snow white formal dress. \"Leeloo,\" said Korben, \"you look beautiful!\" Korben was rewarded with an ear to ear grin and a passionate kiss that lasted until the blackjack dealer cleared his throat. \"Johnny,\" said Korben, \"I'll see you later, my wife and eye are going out to dinner.\" Korben and Leeloo walked out of the casino hand in hand. Getting into one of the shuttles they left the hotel and flew to a small island in the middle of the planets large oceans. They went to a little outdoor café. Korben ordered a stake and Leeloo ordered the chicken. They were in the middle of their meal when all of a sudden Korben's phone rang reaching into his pocket he pulled it out. \"Hello,\" he said. It was the head clerk at the hotel, his name was Geoffrey James but everyone who knew him called him G.J. for short \"G.J.,\" Korben snarled into the receiver, \"how many times do I have to tell you not to call me when I'm out with my wife!\" \"Sorry sir,\" Replied G.J., \"Ruby Rod just walked in and demanded an interview with you.\" \"Listen,\" said Korben, \"you tell that loudmouthed weirdo that he has to make an appointment just like everyone else, and if he gives you any lip about it take his cane and shove it up his you know what.\" \"Yes sir,\" said G.J. with a grin in his voice, \"That's what I thought you would say.\" Korben smiled and hung up the phone. While he had been one the phone Leeloo had finished an entire double sized chicken dinner and had gone to wash up. She was a gorgeous woman with the appetite of a linebacker. In the meantime Korben smothered his steak in steak sauce and began to eat. Suddenly he felt two hands on his shoulders. \"Hello, Korby baby,\" said a sultry voice in his ear. Korben jumped to his feet and whirled around to find himself face to face with his ex-wife.\" \"Charlotte!\" he said in disbelief which soon turned to suspicion, \"what are you doing here?\" \"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I just began to remember how happy I was with you. I want you back Korben.\" She moved forward and began to rub his shoulders with the palms of her hands. Korben merely stood there looking unimpressed. Suddenly in a flurry of motion Charlotte was thrown backwards onto the table which shattered and collapsed leaving Charlotte on the floor in the middle of the rubble. Leeloo was standing there with her back pressed up against Korben's chest giving Charlotte the evil eye. \"Charlotte,\" said Korben with a smirk, \"Meet Leeloo, my wife.\" Charlotte's mouth dropped open. \"Come on my dear,\" said Korben taking Leeloo by the hand, \"our uninvited guest has spoiled my appetite.\" Korben stirred and opened his eyes. Once his vision cleared he turned and looked at the clock it was 1:00 a.m. he turned over to go back to sleep and that's when he noticed that Leeloo was gone. Climbing out of bed he pulled on a robe and went to look for her. He walked in to the living room and as he was passing the balcony door he heard some quiet sniffling. Pushing the door open he stepped out on the balcony and say Leeloo sitting on the wide railing clutching something to her heart. \"Leeloo,\" he said quietly, \"what's wrong?\" \"That woman at the restaurant,\" Replied Leeloo, \"G.J. told me who she was.\" \"So then you know,\" replied Korben crossing the balcony to stand next to her. Leeloo nodded and looked out over the water. \"She was beautiful, and she said that she wanted you back.\" It was at this point that Korben finally saw what she was clutching in her hand. It was the bracelet that he had given her on their first official vacation. The inscription said simply, Korben loves Leeloo. \"Wait a minute,\" said with a look of realization on his face, \"are you worried that you're going to lose me to Charlotte?\" Leeloo nodded miserably. Korben put his arms around Leeloo and hugged her to his chest. \"Leeloo Dallas,\" he said, \"You will never ever lose me, the day you landed in the back of my taxi cab was the day I found the other half of my soul. Besides I know Charlotte she'll chase any man that has a little extra money to throw around.\" Leeloo's face widened into her trademark ear to ear grin. Korben slipped his hand under her legs and lifted her off the railing. \"Now my love,\" he said turning to the door and carrying her back inside, \"Come back to bed.\" The next morning Korben and Leeloo came walking down the stairs to the hotel restaurant having decided to eat breakfast there. They had just sat down when G.J. came running up. \"Sir,\" he said, \"We have a problem.\" \"What is it?\" said Korben \"Do you know those second cousins of yours Old man Byron's adopted kids?\" asked G.J. \"Yeah,\" said Korben, \"what about them?\" \"We were just served legal papers by their attorney Gordon Crowe, they're contesting the Will.\" \"Gordon Crowe,\" said Korben, \"How could they afford him when they were left out of Uncle Byron's will completely?\" Meanwhile…back on earth… A tall dark hard woman wearing black leather stood in an eerie looking out the window of the office that once belonged to Zorg. Just then the door opened and a shorter man with curly hair and blue eyes walked in. \"Korben Dallas just received the papers, Zorlotta,\" he said \"Excellent, Wick,\" said Zorlotta, \"Phase one of my plan is preceding perfectly so Korben Dallas will pay for what he did to my father, Zorg.\" \"If revenge is what you want,\" said Wick, \"Why not just put out a contract and have the man killed.\" \"Because,\" said Zorlotta whirling around to face Wick, \"My father always went with direct approach and it got him killed. Korben Dallas must be dealt far more subtly. Don't worry Wick my plan may not be as cut and dry as my father's plans werebut it will be effective. I promise you that.\" TBC Please leave a review!

No. Left some more. There was a faint click as the last tumbler of the lock slid into place. \"yes!\" I hissed under my breath, looking at the lock and tugging lightly on the small latch to the door. The door swung open, and I looked inside. Laying on the floor of the vault, was a pile of shimmering gold, and jewels. \"holy shit.\" I murmured under my breath. The gold glinted invitingly and I reached out my hand. I gently lifted a shining necklace and placed it in my large black bag that had previously been slung over my shoulder. Underneath it was a drab bag, dark brown in colour and frayed at the edges. I picked it up and was surprised at its weight. I peeked inside and saw a glint of silver. I shrugged, and stuffed the bag into my pocket. I started to put more things into the bag when I heard the faint click of a heel on the floor behind me. I started to stand, but when I heard nothing more, I kept working. A few seconds later there was a slight pressure in between my shoulder blades. \"well, well, well. If it isn't- ...\" the voice stopped and the owner of it pulled off my ski mask and tossed it up and down in his hand. \"well if it isn't Winterr Aaronz. Long time, no catch.

He spun my around again and slapped handcuffs on my wrists. \"you have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.\" \"well then use this against me! BASTARD! I don't give a damn if you are a cop or not, you have no right to arrest me! here I am, a respectable thief, doing an honest day's work. And then YOU come along and slap these damned hand cuffs on my wrists.\" I yelled in ken's face. \"what ever. Now lets get you out to the car.\" We walked out to the car and I cursed mine, and Kenneth Walkers existence. Leena Come on... you can do it girl. I slowly slid my hand into a mans back pocket. I felt something smooth and leathery so I slipped it out and ran. I slipped behind a dumpster at Mc Donald and opened the wallet. My heart was beating, and my ragged clothing was soaked through with sweat. The flies buzzed around me as I looked down at the wallet and cussed at my dumb luck. The ID read- KENNETH WALKER OFFICER OF LAW On the other side of the wallet was a shiny badge. I picked it up and pinned it on my shirt. \"look at me. I'm an officer. An officer with a stinky smelly butt!\" I giggled at my little joke. My stomach rumbled and I stuffed the wallet down into my pocket, and prayed that it wouldn't fall out. I climbed into the dumpster and hunted around through the trash until I found a partially eaten happy meal. This was my lucky day! It was the first time I had eaten in about a week, so I gulped the food down ravenously. I clambered out of the trash and fell onto the sidewalk, skinning my knee. I limped back to the plaza and looked around for something else to steal. I saw a pair of teal blue pants straight ahead of me with a bulge in their right back pocket. I started to walk towards them when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at the uniform of a police officer. \"Hello officer.\" I said, trying desperately to stay calm. \"Hello there little one. May I ask why you are sneaking around like that? Did you take something that doesn't belong to you perhaps?\" he asked in a calm voice. I straightened up and tried to look innocent. \"no officer... um... officer\" I looked at his name that was sewn onto his uniform. \"officer Walker.\" \"well then, may I ask why you are wearing my badge?\" I looked down at my shirt and saw the silver sparkle of the badge. \"I just got busted. Didn't i.\" The officer laughed and tightened his grip on my arm. \"you sure did!\" \"fuck you.\" my mind was whirling, and I suddenly turned my body, wrenching my arm out of his grip and breaking free. I ran down the plaza, dodging people left and right. The officer was running after me, and a foot suddenly shot out from the crowd. I fell forward, putting my right hand out to break my fall. As I hit the concrete, I felt the bones in my arm snap. I screamed and started to cry. \"It hurts!!! It hurts!!! I want my mommy!\" I yelled, clutching my arm. The police officer lifted my bodily in his arms and ran with me to the car. Once there he picked up a two-way radio. \"unit 33-7 in route to the hospital.\" Crackling back over the radio came static, then a voice. \"why?\" \"a female, about,\" he paused and turned to look at me, \"8 years old. She has a broken arm. Over and out.\" He switched the talking radio off, and the sirens on. I could feel the gentle pressure inside the car building as we sped down the road. My head started to spin, and I sat up straight, clutching my arm. \"oww.... I want my mom.\" The car lurched over a speed bump, sending me crashing into the door, hitting my broken arm on it in the process. I yelled in pain, and then blacked out. Ken \"kid?\" I turned again as looked at the young girl who was sitting in the seat beside me. She was slumped forward against her seat belt and breathing faintly. \"oh shit.\" I muttered to myself. We pulled into the hospital drive way and I unbuckled her restraints, causing her to fall forward onto her broken arm again. she opened her eyes for a moment and whimpered in pain. I picked her up, and was shocked to find that she was almost weightless. I ran through the swinging doors, and into the lobby of the emergency room. A man in a white coat came running to me, so I assumed that he was a doctor. \"are you a doctor?\" \"yes. Kenneth Walker, right? I've heard so much about you.\" He babbled. He glanced down at the child in my arms. \"what happened?\" he asked me, looking quizzical. \"help her now, ask questions later.\" I snapped, taken back at his ignorance of my small charge's injuries we raced into the emergency room, and to the beds. I softly laid the girl down on one of them, and settled into a chair next to her. A doctor, more dignified then the intern who has ushered me in, tapped me on the shoulder and offered some hot coffee. \"what brings you here?\" he asked me, shooting a glance at the small child. \"this little one,\" I pointed at the girl, \"stole my wallet, and would have gotten away with it if she hadn't come back to the plaza where I was and I saw my badge pinned to her shirt.\" \"how did she hurt herself?\" \"she tried to run, but fell and I think she broke her arm.\" The doctor walker over to the girl, and took a needle off the silver cart alongside her bed. He took her small, thin uninjured arm in his big hands and inserted the needle into the skin of her forearm. he then attached a clear plastic tube to the needle. I ran my eyes along the tube. It ended in a large plastic bag, which dripped fluid into the tube, and into her arm. \"its called an I.V.\" the doctor said. \"we're going to have to take her down to X-ray, so we can find out just how badly her bone is broken.\" \"um... alright...\" I muttered. I sat and waited for almost 45 minutes before they wheeled her back in. \"Mr. Walker? You should wake up now. She's asking for you.\" Huh? I had fallen asleep? \"I was asleep?\" I mumbled, looking up and rubbing my eyes. I glanced over at her bed, where she was laying with a stark white cast on her arm, and frightened eyes. \"officer?\" she whispered, looking at me. \"you're still here!\" she started to cry, so I got up and walked over to her bed. \"Shhhhhhh its ok. I'm right here.\" I said, taking my hand and brushing her hair out of her eyes. \"don't cry. Everything will be ok.\" she looked at me and smiled a little. Then she pushed herself up on her uninjured arm and lay propped up like that. I walked back over to my chair and sat down. I let my eyes slip closed, and next thing I knew I was in dreamland. I woke up some time later to gentle snoring close to my ear. I looked down to find that she had crawled out of her bed, into my lap and had flung her arms around my neck. I reached my arms out and wrapped them around her, to try to stop her shivering. I looked around, and saw a blanket on the floor. I picked it up and wrapped it around her. She looked up for a minute. \"daddy?\" \"no, its just me Ken.\" I said, keeping my arms around her. She snuggled into the bulk of my jacket and the warmth of the blanket. \"Mmmm\" she murmured, drifting off to sleep. I looked down at her, and saw the faint shadow of her eye lashes on her cheeks. I smoothed her hair. Man, I thought to myself, I must be going soft or something. I closed my eyes and fell asleep. Lex ","Summary":" Winterr Left.... No. Left some more.

Five Things Korben Knows I He does things he isn't necessarily proud of; he does things he knows will slowly smolder into his brain until some years later when he's fifty, he wakes crying and alone, another casualty of a belated stress-related syndrome. He thinks sardonically of the check they'll give him once a month, when he's insane and no one will want to hire a cracked and bloodshot ex-soldier: here's disability, for your lights and your fridge and your goddamn cat. There's a dead man behind this door, though the man doesn't know it yet. Dallas thinks, There's plenty of dead men out here. The hallway is dark and the lights flicker; he checks his gun and hoists it to his shoulder, opening the door with the stolen code the government gave him to memorize. The dead man turns and gapes, too terrified to scream or run. \"No,\" says the dead man, weakly, and Dallas can't care enough to correct him. II Her name is Carmen and she is twenty-two years old, tall, leggy, and blonde. She knows how to style her hair, and she knows what she wants from him and his job. He likes the way she looks when she's painting, checking every corner in their middle-class joint-owned apartment to make sure the colors match. She says, \"Why don't we get married?\" The light reflects off her pale hair, and she smiles slyly at him, ducking into the forgotten white dress-jacket he bought and never used. \"We can call your mom.\" Ma likes her, even though she thinks no girl is good enough for her son. \"You could do worse,\" she snorts at him, and demands grandchildren at some point. He nods, and fixes his eyes on the distance, not really listening as he sees Carmen flipping through a magazine for fashionable dresses. He wants to believe he loves Carmen. He knows he doesn't. III He says he'll quit; he'll retire and find something else he can do for a living, something else his talents are good for. Carmen won't ask what talents those could be, and he's glad - he thinks, humorlessly, it would be a life of crime. She takes her ring off and throws it at him, sometimes, when screaming isn't enough, when she doesn't want him to shout right back. He lets the gold jewelry hit him and he shouts anyway, wants her to understand this isn't what he wanted either. \"You're never here !\" she screams, and he shouts, \"When the hell have you ever noticed?\" She sleeps with a man he doesn't know and sometimes Dallas thinks he doesn't even care anymore. IV He stopped answering the phone a month ago, tired of Ma and legal threats from Carmen (with his former lawyer breathing at her neck) and various military types all wanting something. He wants to tell them to shut up, to go to hell because he's having a hard enough time trying to hold a goddamn job that starts before he's even fully awake in an apartment he can barely walk in, with no company but a drug-dealer to his right and a drug-addict to his left. Some time after the second month of retirement from the military and the first year away from Carmen, he stops caring when they call. The small check the military gives him - pension, disability; whatever it is, it's money - helps him pay for what utilities he does use. He buys a treat for his cat every once in a while, and has some faith that at least this one creature depends on him. Eventually, the phone stops ringing and Ma only calls when she thinks he'll answer. V Her hand hangs from the vent, limp and pale, streaked with dark red - her blood, or alien blood, but all he knows is he has to get Leeloo out of the ventilation system, out of danger. He sees the bodies on the floor, mostly dead and lumped where they fell; it's only when he has her in his arms, and he looks at the serene, uneven grey around him, that he realizes how easily he reverted back to special operations. She breathes, lightly, weakly, and he thinks, fine, I'll do whatever I have to if she stays safe. He never thinks he loves her; he never knows. He merely does. end ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Korben, Leeloo, Mrs. Dallas, and The Cat belong to Luc Besson and all parties involved."},{"Movie":"Fifth Element","Title":"And Your Love","Author":"Anne O. Theodora Universella A","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/556985","Passage":"[Chapter 1] And Your Love It was true what the Diva had said. Layloo was so much more fragile than she appeared. Corbin could tell that much when he pulled her out of the vent. She was limp and obviously terrified. He'd soothed her, comforted her, telling her it was all right, he was there. In many ways she was innocent and fragile. She was the absolute model of perfection, but she was so vulnerable, so afraid, so fragile… so innocent, maybe even naïve. She was meant to be the model of perfection. Everything about her seemed prefect. Even if she hadn't been engineered, Corbin would have thought her perfect. Everything about her was beautiful. He was head over heels for her. He had been in love before… hell, he'd even been married before, but it had never been like this. It had never been so strong, so sweet… so… perfect. But then again, that made sense. Everything else about Layloo was perfect, so it only fit that his love for her would have to feel perfect as well. She'd been on his mind ever since he'd she'd dropped into his cab. He'd lost his license for her. He almost had kept it. He couldn't hold out his resistance, though. He'd helped her. The fear in her voice, her please for help. Those had probably been her two first words in English. \"Please Help.\" They had rung through him, and forced him to help her. His love had led him to save her, and it hadn't been the first time. To tell the truth, he was smitten with her since he'd laid eyes on her. When he took her to that priest's, and he'd said that weddings were the floor below, and congratulated him, he wished he could have smiled and thanked him. It hadn't been the case, though. He thought about how he'd kissed her. He knew it was the wrong thing to do… she hadn't taken it lightly. She'd held a gun to his head over the matter. But it seemed the natural thing to do. It just seemed… right. It was a bad idea and a stupid thing to do, but it just felt right. It was like a reflex. The Diva had said she'd need his love. There was no problem there. He'd already lost his heart to her. If she needed him to show it, he could do it would out a problem. He had never been too much of the romantic type, but he could stoop to 'confessing his undying love for her' with out a twinge. In truth, his military career hadn't been the only thing that had ruined his first marriage. It was starting to have problems of it's own, the military had been the main reason though. The marriage hadn't felt right in retrospect. Oh, he'd loved his ex all right, but it wasn't anything like how he felt for Layloo. Nothing was. She was different. She was… perfect. Every time he looked at her his heart swelled in his chest. Some times, it was even hard for him to breathe around her. As he drove the shuttle, thoughts of her filled his mind. When this was all over, he'd tell her how he felt; he'd make her his. And maybe, just maybe, he might marry her some day. He'd marry her tomorrow if she'd consent. Forget tomorrow, he'd marry her that very day. He'd marry her in the damn shuttle if she'd said yes and the priest was willing to conduct a make shift ceremony. He'd kiss her again… he just hoped that it wouldn't end with a gun to his head like the last one. Most times they'd met, she'd ended up in his arms. She felt so great in his arms. He'd hold her forever if he could. When this was over, he'd tell her how he loved her, he'd hold her in his arms again, he'd kiss her again. Plans and hopes and dreams of Layloo were about his mind as he piloted the shuttle. The Diva's words \"and your love\" also echoed through his mind. The Diva had no need to worry. When this was all over, he'd tell her. He'd give her his love. Little did he know, she'd need his love sooner than that. ","Summary":" And Your Love It was true what the Diva had said.

Taking off my jacket, I frowned at the oppositernwall. That early already? \"What did he say when he didn't find mernhere?\" My secretary shrugged. \"Nothing really,rnsir. He'll be back later.\" \"Come on\", I said, walking past herrninto my office and tossing my jacket onto the desk carelessly. \"He did say something, didn't he?\" \"Well… yes, sir.\" She didn't look atrnme then, but at her toes instead. \"Tell me\", I insisted. \"He called you a… a lazy bugger, sir.\" \"Oh, did he?\" I wasn't trulyrnsurprised at that. \"I've been at it all night, and he knows that. Onernought to be allowed to get a few hours' sleep after that, for hell's sake, evenrnif it means arriving at the office well past ten o'clock!\" \"Yes, sir\", my secretary saidrnobediently. \"Don't you go agreeing with me!\" Irnsat down and shoved a pile of papers away vigorously. No time for that now.rn\"You ought to get some spirit, girl. If you think I'm a lazy bugger, justrntell me.\" \"Yes, sir.\" I sighed. \"You're so boring. Now listen,rnI'll have a look at my correspondence first, then I'd like not to be disturbed,rnexcept by Mr Zorg or my sister. In one hour and a half, I'd like to have therncomplete updated sales figures here on my desk. Understood?\" \"Yes, sir\", my secretary replied oncernmore, and I wondered if her vocabulary really was so limited. She was good atrnher job, that was why I kept her, but she was just no good at small talk, andrneven worse at anything beyond. It couldn't just be put to my intimidating presence,rnsince my sister was kind enough to frequently remind me that I had none. Atrnleast the woman had managed to stop blushing when she looked at me by now. As soon as she had left my office and closedrnthe door behind her, I buried my face in my hands and started rubbing my eyesrnforcefully. Damn, I was so tired! I might well fall asleep just as I sat. Damn, damn, damn. Lazy bugger! I could only snort at that – if Irnwasn't too tired for snorting. It had been half past six in the morning when Irnhad left this place and finally headed home; the sky had been light for somerntime already. Giving in to exhaustion at last, I had not even bothered to takernoff my boots before casting myself down upon my bed. And when I had woken againrnafter barely three hours, I had felt as if only a minute had passed since I hadrnclosed my eyes. But there had been no time for any more rest. I had hastilyrnchanged my shirt, shaved and splashed my face with a bit of cold water before Irnleft my home, and here I was now, back again. Lazy bugger! He truly had nornidea! And then a memory returned to my consciousnessrnwhich made a warm, glorious feeling of happiness and relief seep into myrnstomach. After many a short night, I had at last achieved my goal. The new ZF-1rnmodel was ready to hit the market now. My father would be so proud of me, I thought,rnsmiling to myself. This one model was quite perfect. So light, compared to allrnthe functions it possessed, so easy to take apart, and completely undetectablernby radar! My father had been essential in the process of designing the ZArnseries and all the following models until the ZE, more than five years ago.rnSadly, he had not lived to witness the success of his newest invention. Thisrnwas where I had taken over from him, and I meant to continue his work just asrnhe would have done. As I had left the office earlier this morning to get a fewrnhours' rest, the final concepts had been on their way to the constructionrndepartment. This afternoon, I would hold the final prototype in my hands. This afternoon… it would be exactly fifteenrnyears since the final ZA-1 prototype had found its way into my hands, a presentrnfrom my father for my twentieth birthday. \"Here, son\", he had said,rn\"take it, and use it well. And when your time comes, may you make thingsrnequally marvellous as this.\" I remembered how small it had seemed to me,rnjust a little pistol, and how light, and how perfect in its smooth, slenderrnshape and with its polished silver gleam – and how accurate and deadly whenrnfired. Yes. Perfect. I had not parted with it ever since, not even when thernZD-4, only slightly larger, so very clearly surpassed it. There were so manyrnfond memories I connected with it… like those summer days in Venice, fifteenrnyears ago. Raising my head and lowering my hands, I lookedrnat the two pictures on my desk. One showed me and my family, my father smilingrnand with an arm around my mother's shoulders, my sister and me, children ofrntwelve and ten, in front of them, laughing. On the other, three young peoplernwere standing on a beach, beneath a sky of brilliant sapphire blue. One, arngrinning lad with a dishevelled pudding-basin haircut, was me, with an armrnaround my sister, slim and pretty and with wavy hair of dark blond. The last, arntall, coppery-skinned youth with handsome features, green eyes and a mane ofrngolden curls, was the very same who had called me a lazy bugger this morning.rnThe picture had been taken at Venice, on my twentieth birthday, almost fifteenrnyears ago. The ZA-1 in my belt was clearly discernable if I looked closer. We would be celebrating a grand jubilee today,rnand a very special one. But until then, there were still a few thingsrnthat needed seeing to. With a sigh, I picked up the two envelopes my secretaryrnhad deposited on my desk and slit them open with my pocket knife. One from arncustomer from halfway across the galaxy, asking for another delivery of ZE-8s,rnthe other from my faithful consultant for finances, informing me of a newrnpossible investment. After reading them through, I placed both of them on toprnof the pile of papers. I would see to that later. Getting to my feet and stifling a yawn, Irnwalked over to the far wall, where I tapped a panel briefly with my finger.rnImmediately it slid open, revealing a number of small keys. I typed in therncorrect code, and part of the wall slid aside to reveal a large ornaternbathroom. Spartan furnishings were all very well, since they made you tough,rnbut a bit of luxury always was a pleasant thing. I could be tough in otherrnmatters, but certainly not as far as a hot bath was concerned. I stepped into the hidden room, and the wallrnclosed again behind me, while the lights in the bathroom were automaticallyrnturned on. Once again I thought of my father gratefully. It had been him whornhad had this installed, as well as the bedroom accessible from here. When myrnfather had had lots of work to do, he had sometimes slept here, at his office.rnI never did so, though I enjoyed a bath in here from time to time. Yet Irnoccasionally took a pretty girl along to my father's magnificent four-posterrnbed. I turned on the tabs and poured in some bubblyrnsoap essence, then stripped off my clothes while watching how the bathtub wasrnbeing filled up. Steam rose from it and began to cloud the room, dulling thernhigh mirror at the opposite wall. Grinning contentedly, I prepared a pile ofrnfluffy white towels beside the tub, then turned off the tabs and lowered myselfrninto the hot water. What a blessing! I lay back and closed my eyes, enjoyingrnthe warmth, feeling that I had truly deserved it this time. The only thing to stillrnimprove it would be a girl to work all the tension out of my shoulders – or tornclimb in beside me, as there was room enough in the tub. My sister and I hadrnalmost been able to swim lengths in here when we were small. I must have dozed off, for I suddenly jerkedrnback into consciousness when a voice at my ear said: \"Sleeping instead ofrnworking, are we?\" I automatically checked if I was decentlyrncovered – which was, with all the foam, easily the case – before I realizedrnthat it wasn't necessary because this could be only one person. \"What didrnyou have to wake me for?\" I protested, with much effort but withoutrnsuccess fighting a yawn. \"Look, I know you're almost the boss around here,rnbut for obvious reason this fails to impress me. So why don't you just leave mernat it?\" \"Because you can't spend the whole morningrnsleeping\", my sister answered cruelly. \"Other people are up sincernhalf past six.\" \"I only went home at bloody half pastrnsix\", I groaned. \"I spent the whole goddamn night here! And you knowrnwhat your darling husband called me? A lazy bugger, just imagine!\" \"Oh, I guess he did!\" my sisterrnsnickered. \"You usually give him reason enough.\" Then she veryrnsuddenly turned serious. \"You don't mean you worked until half past six?rnYou know you shouldn't! Mom always said that, remember? To Dad as well, mindrnthat. And didn't I plainly tell you to go home at midnight at the veryrnlatest?\" \"Your being a Zorg doesn't entitle you torntalk to me in that patronizing way\", I grumbled. \"And why don't yourncongratulate me on finishing the job?\" \"Oh. Did you really?\" Now my sisterrnsounded impressed, which gave me at least some satisfaction. \"Sure. You know what day it is today,rndon't you?\" \"Of course. The first real ZA-1 wasrnproduced fifteen years ago.\" \"Exactly.\" I brushed a strand of hairrnout of my face. \"I very much wanted get it done until today, yournsee.\" \"I never thought you would be done with itrnso soon. And neither did Marcus, by the way.\" \"Why doesn't that surprise me?\" Irncommented sarcastically. \"It's always the same with you. You don't trustrnme to do anything right, and when I do it, no matter how often, you're alwaysrnsurprised.\" My sister snorted. \"Which in turnrnshouldn't surprise you , since one may find you lying in the bathtubrninstead of sitting at your desk on a regular base.\" Now it was my turn to snort. \"Call that regular?\" \"Yes\", my sister said coldly.rn\"And you've been in here for some time, apparently. Your secretary saidrnyou told her you didn't want to be disturbed more than an hour ago.\" This made me sit up straight on the spot, andrnmy sister retreated hastily as the water slopped up high from my hurried motionrnand almost spilled over. \" More than an hour ago ? What's therntime?\" \"Half past eleven, almost.\" Had I really slept that long? Damn! Or was myrnsister just making fun of me? No, I assumed, for my stomach gave a discreetrnrumble just then. It seemed to be lunch time for me. \"I'm comingrnout\", I informed her, and she passed me one of the fluffy towels, which Irnwrapped around myself like a cloak as I got to my feet. Climbing out of therntub, I hastily rubbed myself dry and started putting on my clothes again. Irnshould have told my secretary to give me two hours with the sales figures, Irnthought regretfully, instead of only one and a half, so I could have remained wherernI was, lying in the warm, foamy water. But done was done, and anyway, I wasrngoing to find myself something to eat now. \"We ought to see Venice again\", myrnsister said. She was sitting on the edge of the bathtub, absently watching thernwater gurgling out of it. Strands of wavy hair the colour of dark honey framedrnher face, hanging down past her shoulders in a kind of neat disarray. She wasrnpretty, as I noticed once again. If she hadn't been my sister, I might wellrnhave taken her along to the four-poster bed in the next room. Her skin was justrnas light as mine, yet her eyes were brown. Which was peculiar, really; she wasrnfair-haired and dark-eyed, whereas I, the blackhead, had bright blue eyes. Myrnparents had always found it funny, even more so since the two of us quiternresembled each other and had always used to spend most of our time together.rnThe perfect team, they had used to say when we were teenagers, in the hope thatrnit would stay that way for later on. And it had; my sister would back me up inrnevery discussion and manoeuvre me out of trouble before I saw it coming at allrn– sometimes the latter not without grimly scolding me afterwards, just as ifrnshe were the one among us who was one and a half years older, not the other wayrnround. There was no way of fooling my sister, which was really useful, but Irnwas usually the first who felt it. \"Are you listening?\" my sisterrninquired suspiciously. \"Or are you already dozing off again?\" \"Yeah, right\", I assured her hastily,rnshrugging into my shirt, \"I agree with you.\" And to make sure shernknew I had been listening, I added: \"One of these days, I'm going to buy arnpalace at Venice.\" My sister laughed. \"Dear brother, you'vernalways been a hopeless show-off.\" \"You think I can't afford it? I mean, yourncan't be possibly doubting my intellect this time.\" This was the usualrnpattern of discussion, and my sister had the tendency to gain the upper hand inrnit pretty soon – despite the fact that I was the more eloquent one among therntwo of us. \"I'm doubting the way your greedy littlernmind works. You want to have this, and that, and everything, just according tornyour current fancies.\" \"All right, you can doubt me all yournlike\", I sighed. Even when she was teasing me, like now, it was vain tornargue by just disagreeing. There was a saying in the higher levels of therncorporation: You don't disagree with Marie Elisa Zorg straight away, or elsernshe is going to change your mind very quickly. \"At least you can'trndoubt my work this time.\" \"We'll see\", she answered tartly,rnthen broke into giggles and jumped up from her seat to give me a hug, just asrnshe had done when she was still a girl. \"Silly brother!\" \"You'd like a palace, though\", Irnremarked, putting on the high leather boots I was so particularly fond of. \"Actually, yes. Preferably along the CanalrnGrande, and on the San Polo side, but with the bedrooms facing some quiet lanernor channel, although not too narrow.\" \"So you have fancies, too\", I stated.rn\"No need to give me the rough side of your tongue, then.\" \"Sometimes it's necessary\", shernsnickered, matching me quite perfectly in her mischievous expression – onlyrnthat she would, under normal circumstances, never admit that she had arnmischievous streak just as well. \"Right\", I said, hanging the towelrnneatly over the rack where it was supposed to be before my sister could give merna disapproving scowl for letting things lie around, \"I think we're donernhere.\" My sister pressed a button well concealed amongrnthe room's décor, and the hidden door slid open, letting us pass through,rnfollowed by a thin cloud of vapour wafting out after us until the door slidrnshut again. But we were not alone in the office. Myrnsecretary was standing in the door, her whole attitude signalling disapproval,rnsuspiciously watching the curly-haired man sitting at my desk and going throughrnmy papers. When she saw me, she announced, quite unnecessarily: \"Mr Zorgrnis here, sir.\" The man looked up and grinned at mernbroadly. \"Morning, boss\", he said.[Chapter 2] \"One question\", said myrnbrother-in-law, getting up from my desk to greet me. \"Which Mr Zorg didrnshe just announce, you or me?\" \"Quite obviously, you. This is my office, in case you haven't realized that yet.\" But I grinned as I saidrnit. Nobody could be angry at Marcus for long, and after all, I found it usefulrnwhen he took on some of my work, even when he did it without asking first. \"Don't complain\", Marcus laughed,rnbrushing a long, curly strand of blond hair out of his eyes. \"Especiallyrnsince I'm going to answer your mail for you.\" \"Great idea, Marc. You do that.\" \"Don't let him exploit you\", myrnsister put in. \"You offer him something like that once, you'll have to dornit always.\" Marcus shrugged. \"I've done it before, yournknow. At least he doesn't boss me around – like you.\" But he smiled at herrnwarmly as he said it. Although I kept tossing the prejudice at myrnbrother-in-law that marriage was nothing but a milder form of slavery, herninsisted on being happily married to my sister, and he claimed to havernabsolutely no complaints about her – which I, in turn, found somewhat surprising,rnyet maybe this could be explained by Marcus's almost unnaturalrngood-naturedness. I for my part was never going to marry. Of course, there wasrnthe question of heirs to take over the company one day, but my sister andrnMarcus had produced three of them already, so there was nothing to worry aboutrnfor me. I could go on as I had always used to, taking all the women I wantedrnwithout committing myself. \"No\", said my sister, \"Manuelrnisn't the type to boss you around. He'll play your best buddy and sneak up tornyou, and then he'll start being persuasive.\" I grinned. That could sum it up nicely – atrnleast as far as Marcus was concerned. \"I can be very persuasivernsometimes.\" My sister gave me a frown. \"You've sleptrnwith my secretary again, haven't you?\" This caught me by surprise. How could shernpossibly know? \"Why?\" I managed. \"Yes, I really wonder why\", my sisterrnsnapped, not at the least willing to tell me how she had found out. \"Sherndoesn't seem that suitable for you to me.\" I shrugged, while Marcus grinned broadly, as herndid so often. To him, such dialogues seemed very amusing, especially whenrnbetween my sister and me. \"She's well built, and she's bright\", Irnanswered resignedly, since my sister knew anyway. \"And she's eager tornplease.\" Marcus whistled and rolled his eyes, but wasrnquickly silenced by a glare from my sister. \"But I'm notrnpleased\", she growled at me. \"Sleep with your own secretary, for arnchange!\" And she silenced the snort of laughter from Marcus as well. \"Why would you care?\" I tried,rnslightly annoyed at her sudden change of mood, and over so small andrnunimportant a thing, though my mischievousness was a lot stronger than myrnanger. \"You're not her lover, are you? So there's no need to bernjealous.\" This time Marcus's snicker could not be stoppedrnby glaring. \"Enough of that silliness\", my sisterrncommanded, sitting down at my desk and shoving my papers out of her way. Marcusrnand I exchanged a glance, and she clicked her tongue at us irritably.rn\"Marcus, Manuel says he is done with the ZF-1 work.\" \"Really?\" Marcus exclaimed. I felt a huge grin pulling the corners of myrnmouth apart. \"You bet.\" I was so proud at that moment, proud beyondrnimagination, yet that my sister had just given up on holding me a longerrnlecture certainly added to my spirits' soaring high. \"A whole poundrnlighter than the original concept, breaks up easily into four parts, with thernnet launcher added, and undetectable by radar.\" This announcement had exactly the desiredrnimpact. \"You must be kidding\", my sister exclaimed, while Marcus justrngasped. \" Undetectable ? That's downright impossible! Not with arnthing that size.\" \"Are you sure about this?\" Marcusrnasked. Despite what he sometimes pretended, he knew much about weapons. \"Look, I may have been more or lessrnbrain-dead at three this morning, but our radar systems certainly weren't. Theyrncan't detect anything if you just remove that heat grid and the chargerncounter.\" \"You can't remove the heat grid\",rnMarcus objected, at the same as my sister said: \"But you need the chargerncounter!\" \"You can put them back in when you needrnthem\", I explained. \"They're just additional equipment. You simplyrnchuck them into the spare parts compartment of your ship, where nobody will payrnany attention to them even if they search your ship thoroughly, and put them onrnthe gun when you feel like it. It works just as well without, by the way.\" \"Maybe, but you burn your fingersrnwithout the heat grid\", my sister said pragmatically. \" I don't\", I remarked, givingrnher a meaningful look. \"But he's got a point, Lisa\", Marcusrnput in before she got a chance to snap my head off. \"This is a brilliantrnidea. It'll sell like nothing before, especially to races like… like thernMangalores, for instance.\" \"Like the what ?\" My sister raised her eyebrows at me.rn\"Don't you ever read the newspapers? Or watch the news, at least?\" \"No\", I said flatly, while gazing atrnher pointedly. \"People expect me to work.\" This earned me one of my sister's mostrnirritable \" tsk s\". \"Don't you go referring to that discussion. You were reading the paper while supposedly listening to me, then,rnand it was most impolite of you.\" \"Well, it was breaking news thisrnmorning\", Marcus interjected hastily. \"The Federal Army chased themrnout of their hiding places. They're dispersed all over the galaxy now.\" \"So what did they do?\" I asked,rnpartly out of interest, partly to avoid another discussion about my manners. Marcus shrugged. \"They call themselvesrnwarriors, you know. You can probably imagine. Raids on neighbouring planets andrnso on, and constant fighting among themselves, as well, among their clans orrnsomething like that. An extremely unpleasant kind, and with a most interestingrnconcept of honour.\" \"A wholly distorted concept ofrnhonour\", Lisa added. \"They consider it a question of honour to blowrnup things, it seems. Ships and so on.\" \"Pretty weird\", Marcus agreed. \"They raid, slay and ravage without regardrnto anything – a disgrace to the civilized world. It was about time thernFederation got fed up with them.\" \"And scattered them to the winds\",rnMarcus said with satisfaction. \"However, they have one ability which makesrnthem highly interesting.\" \"Which is that?\" I asked, right onrnclue. \"They're shape-shifters\", my sisterrnexplained. \"They're what ?\" \"Shape-shifters\", my sister repeatedrnpatiently. \"They can change their appearance at will.\" There was only one thing I had to say to this:rn\" Bloody hell !\" \"Yes, that's what I said when I heard itrnthis morning\", Marcus remarked. \"You sure you're not kidding me?\" \"Perfectly\", Marcus insisted.rn\"It was on the news. They can change their appearance in a heartbeat. It'srnreally amazing. They could be anyone.\" \"Alright, you've got me, folks\", Irnsaid, and Lisa and Marcus both gave me surprised looks. \"I'm justrnmasquerading as me; in truth I'm a bloody great big… thingy. What did you callrnthem?\" \"Mangalores\", Marcus helped me out,rnlaughing. \"I might even believe you\", my sisterrngiggled. \"You must have been one all your life. That explains sornmuch.\" \"Thanks, dearest sister, you're sorncharming today. What do they look like normally?\" \"Ugly\", Marcus replied immediately. \"Humanoid, but taller than a man\", myrnsister described them. \"Grey and somewhat wrinkled skin, bald, large blackrneyes, no real noses, yellow fangs in a wide mouth – or gaping maw, that somehowrnfits better – and funny ears.\" \"Pointy ears\", Marcus added,rn\"but they point downwards.\" I tried to form a picture in my mind and foundrnthat Marcus's first attempt to describe them had been quite suitable.rn\"Sounds like some kind of modern orcs to me.\" Marcus exchanged a glance with my sister, whornnodded. \"Might be a good association. Space orcs.\" \"Well, you must know\", said Lisa,rnagain giving me that mischievous look. \"I've been suspecting for yearsrnthat my parents brought up an orc together with me.\" \"I love you too, Lisa.\" Marcus snickered. \"You two are simplyrnhilarious today. Has he done anything to you this morning, like, let's say,rndisagreed with you?\" Giggling, my sister leapt up from her chairrn(which was, in fact, mine) and wrapped her arms around my neck. \"He's donernnothing wrong. He's my favourite orc.\" \"And you're my favourite mountainrntroll\", I answered, cuddling back. Whatever Lisa said to me, she was stillrnmy beloved little sister, even if she pretended to be the elder sister, told mernoff for being rude and not wiping my boots and tried to send me to bed. And Irnwas her admired elder brother, even if I spat cherry stones across the tablernand chose to consider lounging in an armchair with one leg over its side arnproper position for official meetings. \"Ah, right\", said Marcus, amused,rn\"so nothing to worry about, eh? As I was saying, Manuel, before I wasrninterrupted by your manifesting ignorance, we might make a grand deal withrntypes like the Mangalores if you really managed to make it undetectable.\" \"I hope they won't be the only ones\",rnI answered sceptically, \"or else we might get into a bit of trouble withrnthe Federal Government.\" Lisa snorted. \"Forget it. They're so busyrnwith themselves, and they're in no position to even negotiate as long as you'rerntheir creditor.\" \"Good point\", I admitted.rn\"Still, I'd like to get a proper contract with the Federal Army orrnsomething. Business with them is not as good by far as it might be.\" \"On the other hand\", Marcusrninterjected, \"we've earned quite a fortune by offering them credit, sorndon't complain.\" \"Yeah, and payment's due by nextrnTuesday\", I said. \"I've had a word with that old fool Lindbergh,rnquite clearly stating that I don't want to hear any more excuses.\" \"Oh dear\", my sister remarked,rnletting go of me with a frown. \"I hope you didn't say the same as last time.\" Marcus had taken to riffling through the papersrnon my desk once more. Now he raised his head as well as his eyebrows.rn\"What did he say?\" My sister rolled her eyes at me before shernplanted her feet on the ground firmly and about two spans apart, hooked herrnthumbs into her belt and threw her head back to the left in what appeared quiternan arrogant way to shake the hair out of her face. \"I don't give a damnrnabout bloody legal restrictions\", she said in the dark, gruff voice shernalways used to imitate a man. \"Where's my goddamn money?\" Marcus and I couldn't but laugh at that.rn\"Alright, thanks\", Marcus snorted. \"I can almost see himrnnow.\" \"Hey, I didn't quite strike thatrnpose\", I objected. Somehow my sister could always make me look like anrnarrogant git when she imitated me. \"You did! I was standing right behindrnyou.\" \"I did not !\" \"You did, too!\" \"Did not !\" \"Did too!\" \"Bloody did NOT!\" \"Of course you did! Stop bickering!\" \" You're bickering! And I stillrndidn't!\" \"Sure you did!\" \"Never!\" \"If you two would permit me\", Marcusrnput in, grinning, \"I think your secretary wants a word with you,rnManuel.\" Only now I noticed that my sister and I werernstanding opposite each other with our fists clenched, glaring and looking as ifrnwe were going to jump at each other's throat any minute now. Hastily I assumedrna more neutral position and turned to face my secretary, who was standing inrnthe doorframe and giving me a weird look. \"What?\" I barked at her,rnsharper than intended. \"Your sales figures, sir.\" \"Give them here.\" Striding across thernroom, I snatched them from her. \"Next time you knock. And if you think I'mrna crazy bloody freak, just tell me.\" \"Yes, sir\", my secretary acknowledgedrnshakily. \"Don't you go yessirring me all the time!rnI can't stand it!\" \"Yes, s… I mean, sorry, sir.\" I sighed, exasperated. That woman just didn'trnpossess the slightest sense of humour. Taking life that seriously made you endrnup in… well, probably in her position. And maybe in a lunatic asylum a fewrnyears later. And she would certainly blame me if she did. \"Sales figures?\" Marcus asked as soonrnas my secretary had left the room. \"Why don't you just hand themrnover?\" I spread the four sheets of paper out on therndesk, and the three of us bent over them to have a look. Altogether, businessrnwas going magnificently, especially in the company's main enterprises. Thernsub-firms were all positive, at least, but some obviously did not earn us toornmuch. Two of the smaller taxi firms run by one of the sub-firms were teeteringrnright on the edge. Maybe I should sell them, I thought. They just weren't asrnprofitable as me and my advisors had hoped they would be. Selling them might atrnleast fetch a bit of money. \"Just wait 'til the ZF-1 enters thernstatistics\", Marcus beamed, rubbing his hands. \"The figures are goingrnto explode, I bet you.\" He was the economist among the three of us, yet itrndidn't really need an economist to predict that. Without Marcus realizing it, the mention of thernZF-1 together with the word \"explode\" at once caused an association.rn\"By the way, folks\", I said casually, \"did I yet tell you aboutrnthe little red button?\" At once I had their full attention, and thernsales figures were forgotten. \"What little red button?\" myrnbrother-in-law asked, just as my sister demanded: \"What are you talkingrnabout?\" I shrugged nonchalantly. \"Oh, I justrnwanted to counsel you never to try it indoors.\" Lisa and Marcus exchanged a glance.rn\"Explain\", my sister said. Grinning, I set about to do so. Today, life wasrngood. ","Summary":" \"Mr Zorg was here to see you, sir\",rnmy secretary informed me.

It wasnnearing dark, but he showed no expression of leaving quite so soon.nOne leg was propped up, his arm resting on it as the other leg wasnbent and flat on the ground, his other hand supporting hisnbodyweight. The snow had fallen coldly onto his wool coat, underneathnhe was dressed nicer than he had ever been, but like the snownsticking to him, so did the ice sickles that stuck to his heart. Itnwas pain enough holding back the tears, his body couldn't take it,ncouldn't tolerate it any longer, but he held his face in it'snstone, cold expression, the one everyone had known him by. Alena....nThat name whispered through his mind and surged into his veins. Henclosed his eyes, the tombstone in front of him showed the engravednname of the woman he thought of. She had died young and he hadnremembered it all, her smile, her laugh... the trickster she was. Shenwasn't much of a fighter and was actually the complete opposite ofnhim, yet they had bonded faster than anyone he had ever met. Itnhad started when she was sick, they had been together for 3 years andnnothing could separate them, but then she got sick. In the new worldnof this evolved universe they had thought of every cure for everyndisease imaginable, except for an exceptional few. Nothing wasnperfect, not even in the medical world and he slowly watched herndeteriorate into nothing more than skin and bones. Her cries sickenednhim at night; her screams clutched at his heart then ripped it fromnhis chest and after 7 months of nothing but pain and agony, thensounds of her begging at night to be put out of her misery, he hadnawoken at 2 am, when the city was sleeping. Itnhad been all those years ago, he was different then, he wasn't sontemperamental... and as he remembered what he had done, it made himnwant to vomit. As he sat, he flashed back again on what had happenednnext. She was sleeping, for once she was sleeping so soundlynunderneath the clean white sheets, the warmness of them gave her somencomfort and after he had given her a gentle kiss goodbye withoutnwaking her, he had done what had to be done, he ended the many futurenmonths of torture that would rack her body, craze her mind and bringnher skin splitting pain. It would only get worse, the splitting ofnher skin, the internal bleeding... would only get worse. Evernso slowly with shaking hands he had loaded his small pistol,nclutching to the gun with both hands. It was an older pistol, but itnwould not be one of his own weapons he had created that would end hernpain. After loading it, with tears streaming down his eyes, henwatched her turn and sigh with pain, still sleeping, then, he pullednthe trigger. Itnwas all too fast, but he had soon found himself in the same room,nback against the wall, shaking, sobbing, he could barely hold thencigarette between his fingers and he sat there for hours on end,nstaring at the sight in front of him. It was a clean job, barely anynblood showed above the body, yet underneath would be a differentnstory. He had done what needed to be done, she had diedninstantaneously, no more pain, no more suffering. Hennow flashed back to the current time, placing a red rose atop hernsnow covered grave, he kissed it gently, then turned and headed backnto his car. The drive back was no better, it was pitch black, thensnow turning to rainy sleet and his elbow leaned on the doornsupporting his head, the other hand on the steering wheel. He wasndeep in thought about another subject, the second woman in his lifenthat lifted the coldness from his shoulders, the burden he carriednabout the murder he had committed, one he did not want to do. Shenhadn't known about it, he dared not tell her.... not now anyway.nShe would find out one day, either by him telling her or a leakage ofninformation. His employees kept shut about the matter, everyone knewnhow sick she was and how the government had never issued any type ofneuthanasia of any human for medical purposes. So she was left to diena horrible death... until he put a stop to it. Turningninto Zorg Corp. thoughts raced in his mind. How he couldn't losenBrooke, not now, not ever. His life seemed to turn around with hernand so did hers. He was cold and had a short temper, she was lonelynand didn't trust, had a mean spirit and never asked questionsntwice, she just killed. He had to admit, she was good, very good....nbut even she did have her mental break downs, depressions and offndays, just like him, just like now. Henhad headed up the building stairs, out into the vast marble area,nwhere the front desks were. Past the front desks were flights ofnmarble stairs lined with glass. He passed the large meeting dome,npassed several other offices and went down a narrower hall. Thenbuilding was built finely, floors of marble, walls of wood and steel,nceiling of glass. It had suited him, pleased him... for a whilenanyway. But business was starting to get boring, he wanted somethingnnew in his life, something that would thrill and exhilarate him...nand that's when she came along.[Chapter 2] ((Andnyou all thought I abandoned this... really now! What gave you thatnidea?)) Disclaimer:nZorg Not mine... Brooke is mine... Thendesk that he sat at felt cold and unforgiving. The air conditioningndidn't help the situation either and Zorg let his head rest againstnthe chair that he sat in. Closing his eyes, he thought, long and hardnabout the last few years of his life. Was he doing the right thing, anbusiness of weapons and illegal doings? Of course... that's whatnbrought the money in, even if it WAS illegal. He sighednheavily, looking back down at his desk, seeing the pile of paperworknmade him insane, even though most people thought he already was. \"What'snwrong?\" A small, voice full of authority was heard from across thenroom. The voice belonged to a female, not very tall and a strongnIrish twinge to it that sounded like ringing bells to his ears. Thenfemale turned in her chair from the console in front of her, legsncrossed, her skirt neatly lain across her knees and pressed. \"Nothin'ndarlin', just some paperwork.\" He usual southern accent alwaysnsounded odd next to her Irish one. The girl blinked at him and shooknher head. \"Notnpaperwork.\" She replied back, still blinking in his direction asnshe awaited an answer. To the normal eye, she looked completelynhuman, nothing out of the ordinary. Yet inside her body was ancompletely different story and Zorg knew it. He just hoped he didn'tnhave to go through it, that and her temper when she found out aboutnthe secrets he kept from her, about her. Ever since she had beennreunited with her brother on a low level, her uncle deceiving him andnturning... supposedly dead, although not everyone agreed on that. Zorgnhated himself at times, keeping the lies about Brook from her, alongnwith his past life he felt he could have shared with her, but didn't.nBrooke deserved better than that, she always did. He turned his bodyntowards hers, letting a slight smile come across his face. \"Ah,njust some deals went south darlin' ah told ya those Mangaloresnweren't easy t' deal with...\" He studied her more as shenlistened, already now turned back to her own work. His eyes scannednher body, muscular and sleek, they had enjoyed many sword matchesntogether in the training rooms, many in awe of both their abilities,nespecially since Zorg had a gimped out leg. \"Wanna go to lunch? Mahntreat...\" He tried to catch her attention, knowing she was dwellingnon the subject of his stress level. \"No.\"nThe young woman replied back. \"Already ate when ye' were out...\"nShe did this time turn her body towards his. \"Where were yananyways?\" She asked, although prying, it was an innocent enoughnquestion. Zorg had been disappearing at times lately, sometimes notncoming back for hours and in a much different mood than before. Shenonly hoped that his interest in her hadn't faded. Any woman in thencity would kill to be his right hand, with all the money and wealthninvolved. \"What'snwith all the questions? I go out... what I do is none of yournconcern.\" He talked to her as if she were one of his minions, yetnhe did cherish her on a higher level and hadn't realized how sternnhis voice was towards her question. \"Inworry about ye... that's why! Forget it...\" She turned back tonthe console, searching through some of the security files of thenbuilding. Feeling somewhat guilty about the issue, he tried to speaknagain, yet the blaring alarms in the office ruined it. They werenfrequent, ever since the search for Mr. Shadow's 'special stones'nthere had seemed to be more and more trouble... \"I...\"nHe began his sentence, yet didn't get the chance to finish, she wasnalready suiting up. \"Don't do this...\" Was all he managed.n\"Please Brooke, ah can't do this again...\" Brookenturned towards him, puzzled. \"I... always do this... you do too...nwe suit up and kill intruders. What is your issue lately? I thinknyou're taking the wrong happy pills...\" She started to clip thenleather on her arm, but Zorg stood up. \"Because...\"nHe gripped her arm, yet not firmly. \"I can't go through itnagain...\" \"Gonthrough what!\" She tried to yell over the alarms, yet they grewnlouder and she picked a ZF-1 from a nearby weapons storage closet.n\"You're too nuts right now to fight. I'll send security up.\"nShe looked at him one last time and headed into the hall, downntowards the security consoles. ((Sorrynthis chapter is such a drag...

During that time he had been eager to voice his opinions on matters of morality, but had found that was not what they were looking for. He found that what they wanted was an informed apology, a mender of spiritual wounds, an anonymous addresser of the public masses. In the last week alone he had written letters of apology and blessing to thirty two families. The letters concerned accidents that were blatantly preventible and obviously the government's fault. Priest Cornelious had worked hard for this soulless position, all in the spirit of his mission, so he could be able to address President Lindberg himself if need be when the time came. The time was here. So he sat in the general operations room. It felt strange to be awaiting the chance to save the universe from eternal darkness on a cold low bench. It helped that David was here with him, though he was ten times more nervous than he was and showed it in every action. Poor David was only seventeen and had been bestowed with such responsibility. He was a fine apprentice for the line of guardian priests, just young. Every twenty seconds or so the President's assistant would whisper the next issue in the agenda. Cornelious saw the President's face twitch in a peculiar fashion to this whisper, and knew it must be the topic he was there for. \"Put him through\" the President said \"General Staedert, I have to address the Supreme Council in thirty seconds, just the facts.\" \"Mr. President,there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..\" \"The President grunted, and then replied \"What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is. \" \"Not yet Sir, only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!\" \"Options?\" The president was quick to ask. \"Wait or act\" Staedert replied, with the emphases on act. \"Reconmendations?\" \"My philosophy is shoot now and ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests\" Staedert sounded proud of that. The President nodded and looked around the room \"Gentlemen?\" to look for advisement. The head scientist spoke up, looking over his shoulder at the president from his console \"I think it would be foolish to shoot at an organism that seems alive, without first taking the time to study it more! Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.\" Cornelious gritted his teeth together, not shooting was right, the scientist was wrong about taking time. \"No, it's just getting bigger\" the President sounded worried now. \"So do people\" the Scientist added \"but that's no reason to shoot them.\" The President shook his head \"The Security of the Federated Territories is and remains number one priority\" he turned to the military reprisentatives \"I suppose General Staedert's \"philosophy\" is acceptable to you?\" As expected the little group of generals and admirals nodded yes. \"All right, with no further objections, Staedert?-\" Cornelious had already been swelling inside with objections and now raised his hand in a knee jerk reaction. A man's voice introduced him as Priest Vito Cornelious of the Presidential Religious Advisory board, expert of astronomical anomaly. The President seemed half surprised and half annoyed at this particular objection, motioning him to explain \"Yes?.\" Cornelious managed to work up enough saliva to speak as he stood. \"I have a different theory to offer you, Mr. President.\" \"I'm listening\" he replied. Cornelious continued \"Imagine for a moment that this, thing is not anything that can be identified because, it's prefers not to be, because it is evil..Total evil.\" \"One more reason to shoot first\" there was an unmistakable hint of sarcasm in the President's voice. The military advisors nodded in agreement again enthusiastically. David was continually praying in the back of the room, quietly, to keep from fainting. This was no time to pull attention to an unconscious teenager. In spite of the President's disbelief Vito Cornelious stood a little taller, continuing onward. \"Evil begets evil, Mr. President. Shooting will only make it stronger.\" Staedert interrupted \"Mr. President, we're at a crisis point.\" The President almost looked puzzled \"Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!\" Cornelious took a confident step forward \"Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.\" Now the President was exasperated \"That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.\" Staedert's voice was cold in reply \"Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missel. Marker lights on the objective.\" Suddenly one of the scientists almost jumped speaking up \"It's structure has just solidified on the surface, as if anticipating the attack. If that's the case, we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.\" \"The most terrible intelligence imaginable, Mr. President\" Cornelious added. Finally the President was hesitant \"Staedert? Give me a minute, I have a doubt.\" Staedert sounded even colder than the last time \"I don't, Mr. President.\" The first series of missiles were launched, and as the Priest expected the dark planet only grew larger. The Scientists in the room buzzed with conversation at the results. The President was worried now \"Staedert? What's going on? Did you destroy it?\" \"I'm about to, Mr. President\" Staedert still sounded confident. Cornelious said a silent prayer as the war ship fired more missiles into the dark mass. Another scientist spoke up \"The planet's diameter has greatly increased and it's moving toward the ship.\" The President was now frantic \"Staedert? Get out of there immediately! I don't want an incident, do you hear me? Staedert?' there was no reply \"Staedert, get out of there! That's an order!\" The dark mass had grown until it swallowed the ship in flames. After the ship had been confirmed destroyed, the room was silent for several very long moments. Finally the President turned to the Priest \"We need to have a talk.\"[Chapter 2] Korbin Dallas awakened with a jolt, ramming his head into his 'built in' shelving. 'Built in shelving' had sounded somehow functional and charming coming out of the mouth of a realtor five years ago. Somehow the lady had managed to make a cramped run down box of an apartment sound like a 'cozy and functional bachelor pad with space efficiency'. The reason why he had fallen susceptible to the realtor's manipulations could most definitely be attributed to one word: Divorce. His heart had just been clean and jerked out of his chest still beating through a brutal and sudden divorce when he had purchased this hovel. Having been kicked out of his home and cleaned dry of his savings, a place within his budget with a view of relatively clean air had sounded like home. Korbin swore under his breath he would remove that shelf. His touch of post traumatic stress syndrom coupled with the shelf was giving him a daily head blow. Every night he'd have dreams filled with gore and death. What do you get for being a retired special forces unit soldier? Some medals, a couple of trophies and bad dreams. He hit the wake up button and his apartment came to noisy life. The sound of the phone ringing added to the noise. \"Yeh yeh yeh!\" he whined, some good morning \"I'm coming\". He bet himself a cup of coffee that was Finger on the phone. He took his sweet time getting to the phone before picking it up \"Yes?\" \"It's Finger, you sound like crap.\" Korbin opened the door for his cat who immediately performed a couple figure eights around his legs purring. He loved his cat. One thing he got was the cat, his cat. He was relieved his ex wife had revealed the fact she hated cats at the divorce proceedings. \"Good morning sweetie\" Korbin replied to his cat. \"Yeah I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.\" Finger replied suspiciously. \"I was talking to the cat \"Korbin made his way over to the coffee maker for the cup he won. \"Oh yeah, I forgot. You still prefer cats to the real thing.\" \"Cats come back.\" Korbin sipped his coffee, wincing at it's harsh acidic flavor, setting it down on one of his shelves. Matches, he needed matches, because he needed a cigarette. One of four a day these days on his plan to quit. He began to rummage through the shelf, turning over a letter of commendation here, a medal of valor there. Finger laughed \"You don't need them to come back, there's millions of women out there.\" Korbin grunted \"I don't want a million women, I want one woman, the perfect one.\" He could practically hear Finger shaking his head. \"There's no such thing bud\" Finger replied. Finger was practically the only friend Korbin had, they had been through the worst together. Finger had gotten him the job as a cab driver at the worst time in his life, but when it came to women they parted ways. Through all the heart ache Korbin still believed in romance and true love, even love at first sight. Korbin turned over a frame, finding it had a picture of he and Finger \"uhg.\" \"What?\" \"I just found a picture of you.\" \"How do I look?\" \"Like crap.\" He finally found his matches, promptly moving to grab a cigarette from the dispenser. \"Must be an old picture....Look Korbin, I want you to bring your cab in for a six month overhaul.\" He lit his cigarette and spoke with it hanging from his mouth \"It doesn't need a sixth month overhaul.\" \"Korbin,\" Finger almost sounded amused \"how many points do you have left on your license?\" \"Uhhh...\" Finger's tone turned more forceful \"I said how many points are left soldier?\" Korbin scrambled for a good number \"At least forty, fifty points.\"Finger lightened up a bit with small laugh \"You're a lousy liar, I'll see you later\" he hung up. Korbin had been a great fighter pilot, and it made him a great cab driver for the most part, but his cab didn't agree. Finger of all people would know that, he had sat next to Korbin for a thousand missions. Korbin hung the phone up and grabbed his coffee, sitting down. The cat stared at him from the counter sitting in front of it's cup. He poured some of his coffee in the cats cup, tapping his mug to the cats. \"Cheers.\" This was going to be a long day.

It's a favorite spot on this side of the galaxy; atmosphere, geology and local funny little two-legged wildlife make it of interest as a common stopping locality for those who were, shall we say, visiting from out of town. In fact, there lay a vehicle now, hovering over the swirling blue planet, and for all intents and purposed it seems to be waiting. It wasn't a warship, nor a merchant craft. It had a sleek look of something designed for speed and secrecy. The creators of said craft were known throughout the galaxy for deep, measured thinking. The Mondoshawans are treasured for diplomatic wisdom and overall are considered gentle giant shepherds of a vast number of species, some of whom were all too intent on war-mongering. To have traveled such a vast distance and to have overcome many trials, none which enter this narrative, must have meant something important lie on that planet. Not a vacation from drudgery drove them, nor sightseeing, or even a mission of intergalactic domination but a mission. What brought them to the edge of the galaxy was desperation. One Egypt. 1914. The midday heat was suffocating enough to be oppressive. Billy was amazed that even after nearly a full season at the dig hadn't been enough to let him adjust to the sweltering desert. Even inside the relatively shadowed coolness of the ruins of the temple wasn't enough to lend itself relief from the feeling of being cooked from the inside out. From his comfortable slump against a pillar Billy let the Professor's droning words wash over him as he let an idle pen sketch over his notepad. Fresh of out the Eastern York Collegiate School and having been trained in classical archeology with a penchant for drawing had led him to some interesting places. The most current of which was the inside of a Nineteenth Dynasty ruin that had been devoted to Ramses II. Mostly his time in Egypt had included sketching near faded hieroglyphics and dictating notes. This particular morning, however, Professor Pacoli had made a discovery that had him glued to the intricately carved ruins of the eastern wall since daybreak, muttering fervently to himself and hurling instructions and inscriptions over his shoulder. There was a great deal of mysticism behind it and after three hours of distracted murmuring that included words like 'millenniumial Hermetic' and 'Tetrabiblos resemblance' Billy succumbed to the heat and the silence and the boredom and allowed his mind and pen to wander. There rose a cacophony of donkey braying and shrill children's voices outside, raised in cheerful laughter and pieces of song; locals hired to help with the dig. They were as good as watchdogs; the deafening boisterous noise meant that someone was coming inside the temple. Billy paused in a very involved drawing that included an anatomically correct examination of the female persuasion as movement caught his eye. The water boy, Selim, holding a water skin under one arm and crawling along the floor with his other, extended a finger to poke a pubescent boy holding a large copper disk. It was an ingenious use of ancient technology that had modern relevance; each copper plate had been beaten flat and angled just so it would catch light and illuminate the deepest part of the ruins that would normally be inky black. Using torches or gaslight had a tendency to leave sooty black marks that would ruin the delicate findings. Well, that was the theory; it helped when your hired hands didn't fall asleep and let the copper disk sag, casting them all into semi-darkness. Selim hissed furiously, \"Aziz! Aziz! \" There was a gusty sigh from the Professor, who paused in his findings to bellow, \"Aziz, LIGHT !\" The booming sound ricocheted in the small space like a gunshot, effectively shaking Aziz out of dozing slumber and Billy snorted, making another mark on the top of his sheet of paper. \" 'Aziz, light.' \" he said mockingly, though very softly. Openly insulting the man who signed the pay was never a wise idea. The Professor let a out a grumbling 'harumph' and turned back to the wall, gesturing with the artists brush he had been using to sweep away imbedded dirt. \"Good, then we start again. When the three planets are in eclipse, the black hole like a door is open, evil comes, spreading terror and chaos. See the snake Billy? The ultimate evil. Make sure you get the snake.\" Billy made a quick squiggle to the side of the nearly full page and answered, \"Yes, yes I got your snake. I got all the snakes. So when does this snake act supposed to occur?\" There was a pause and out of the furious fluttering of muttering came, 'Well if this is the five and this is the one….\" Mutter, mutter. \"Every five thousand years.\" Billy snorted again and went back to his drawing, his voice floating out over the large sketch pad, \"So I've got some time.\" In answer came a resonate voice that echoed eerily in the stifling closeness of the ancient temple. \" 'So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.' \" Billy jerked at the deep and somber voice but quickly smiled in recognition and relief for a break from monotony. \"Father! How good to see you! How are you today?\" Father Abdullah was a Coptic priest from one of the stranger, smaller sects of religion found in the region. He had been given an excellent education in his life, being fluent in several languages, had a rough understanding of ancient Egyptian history, a smattering of archeological knowledge and was considered an important figure both to his native Egypt and neighboring Europe. He was not a tall man but he carried himself with such dignity and pride that he radiated calmness and solidness. He was a favored figure wherever he went, most people were glad to see him. \"Good, Billy, very good. It gives my heart happiness to see such progress in uncovering our ancient past.\" He put a hand on Selim who gawked up at him, still holding the water skin, and smiled deeply. \"You brought the water. Good boy, I will give it to them. Go with God, be safe from evil.\" And took the water skin and gave a little shove, sending the boy on his way. Professor Pacoli, always a little absentminded concerning ancient relics, continued his mumbled monologue, oblivious to their newest visitor. \"You see here these different peoples, or symbols of people,\" Here he pointed briefly to one particular carving; humanoid figures in a rough circle. \" - gathering together the four elements of life, water, air, earth, fire, around a fifth one. A…fifth element.\" His voice slowed, paused in newfound discovery, weighing the implications. Both men missed the brief frozen expression of dismay given by Father Abdullah, a deeply disconcerted look that furrowed his brow. However, his face was clear and untroubled as he turned to address Billy. \"Billy, do you have drinking cups handy? It would hardly do for each of us to take a swig out of one water skin.\" \"Of course, Father. One moment.\" Deep from within the robes of his office Father Abdullah produced a very small vile. With a quick gesture he crossed himself and said very quietly, \"Forgive me, Lord, but they already know too much.\" and poured the substance into the container. It was carefully measured, a secret process passed down through the ages that bordered on alchemy. The components were complex but the result was a temporary blackout that robbed the victim the memories of the last twenty hours of their lives. His approach to the Professor startled him out of revenant concentration and he chuckled, gesturing to the wall. \"Father! I'm so glad you are here! It's the most extraordinary thing! I mean look, it's the greatest find in history!\" Father Abdullah cleared his throat and smiled. \"Yes, it is astounding.…here, Professor, you've been working all day, you must be parched.\" Billy reappeared at his elbow carrying three tin cups that had seen better days. Father Abdullah poured a generous amount into two and pressed it into the Professor's hand. \"Huh? What? Oh yes.\" Professor Pacoli absentmindedly wiped a chalky hand on his white linen jacket and turned back to the inscription, sloshing the water with the movement. He gestured wildly. \"I mean it's like, a battle plan…with good and the evil… and here, a weapon. Against evil. Never before has such inscriptions been found! I'm going to be famous!\" There was a luminous smile on his heat reddened face that was almost like a fever. It bordered on unhealthy and was edging into fanaticism. Father Abdullah gave a strained smile and raised his empty cup. \"Then, then let us toast to your fame!\" Both men raised their cups happily, lost in fevered dreams of fame, fully funded archeological seasons and maybe even a spot in Scientific American. \"To fame!\" \"Salute!\" The Professor raised the cup to his lips tantalizingly, then paused as though just realizing something. Father Abdullah felt his heart thud in his chest. \"Father, I've just realized – you can't toast to something this monumental with mere water-\" With a contemptuous scoff the Professor hurled the contents out of the cup, the liquid disappearing quickly in the greedy dry sand below their feet. \"Sorry, Father, did you say something? Only it sounded as though you made a noise.\" Father Abdullah cleared his throat. There is no time , he thought desperately to himself, soon they will come and - \"Not at all, I only-\" \"Billy! The wine! We must celebrate in style.\" Billy turned his back to rummage through the pack bags just as a noise became perceptible; it was like a hum but it went deeper. It was in the bone, in the gut and in the base of the neck and it was just starting to vibrate the columns and ancient ceiling noticeably as little showers of dust came down over the three men. Outside the camels and children were making a racket again, different from before. There was alarm and wonder in the children's voices. The camels were shrieking like something wounded. Father Abdullah closed his eyes. Professor Pacoli, not one for distractions from precious antiquities, bent back over the recently discovered inscription, lips moving silently. He stopped, abruptly straightening. \"I don't understand, this could be something…but wait, here, yes\" Light were dimming, as though an eclipse was passing over midday desert casting them all into shadow. There was a jolt that made limestone columns shudder. Father Abdullah raised his head and said in a leaden tone, \"They are here.\" Professor Pacoli traced the center of the intricate carving with the tip of his brush, sweat falling from his chin. He did not notice the unnatural quiet. Billy had stopped midway from his kneeling position on the floor, face ashen and staring. Nor did he notice the children, open mouthed and gawking and Father Abdullah grave and unsurprised, waiting. \"This man, this perfect being…\" He spoke into sodden stillness, voice unnaturally loud. The light was nearly gone now; something enormous was setting down outside the temple. \"I know this is the key, I know it. This divine light they talk about, what is divine light?\" There was no light now. The Professor let out an impatient, angry sound from the back of his throat and yelled, \" Aziz, light!\" And there was light, starker and more brilliant than a thousand lamps. Crevices that had never seen illumination since its inception now stood harshly under display from light that seared the eyes. Outside the temple, the landing gear of the space ship had lit up everything. \"Thank you, much better Aziz.\" The Professor muttered distractedly. Aziz tapped the copper plate, mouth open in dumbfounded confusion. The great vessel that had landed as quietly as snowfall had traveled unfathomable distances and it showed in pitted metal scabs and burn marks of the great hull. There was a moment of hushed silence, then the doors opened. Two by two, they marched. Larger than several grown men, swaying as they walked, an awkward gait that made them seem top heavy. The creatures seemed to be made of metal. Cast light from the sun made them nearly glow as though they were surrounded by a nimbus of gold. Humanoid, if you added architecture to flesh; plated armor over graceful curves, tall spikes radiating like a fan across the back and beak-like proboscis that was almost birdlike that formed the head. They marched, oblivious to the turmoil around them. The camels, spooked and frothing with terror had already snapped their moorings and bolted into the desert. The children had run, or cowered or simply stared in the way that children do, not understanding danger but enraptured with wonder. Billy, with shaking hands, ripped his sketchbook open and his hand flew across the sheets as they made a strange procession, heading straight up the ancient temple aisle and towards the still carelessly enraptured Professor. Father Abdullah ran a hand over his sweating face, fell to his knees and murmured, \"My Lord!\" They stopped, spreading out before Professor Pacoli as Father Abdullah attempted to speak but was only able to make a sort of guttural whimper. Running his fingers across the inscribed pictures on the wall the Professor turned and said gleefully, \"Father this is the most unbelievable thing I have ever seen, don't you think-\" And stopped short; he turned and looked up. Then kept looking up for the creature that stood before him was well over three heads taller than he. The small birdlike head before him bobbed and jerked in a curious way, investigating, inquisitive and utterly alien. Shock and terror held the Professor but curiosity is a strange and terrible compulsion, especially in the scientifically minded. \"Are - are you German?\" he managed to stutter out. The fragile looking head swayed back and forth. No. Father Abdullah rose from his knees and rushed towards the creature nearest to Professor Pacoli, the one with the slightly deeper colored gold tones than the rest. \"Lord,\" he began frantically \"I know he was about to discover everything but there is no need to worry, I was there in time.\" There was silence from the creature, then a click-hiss noise. \" Priest…you and those before you have… served us well .\" came a voice from deep within the body of the creature. It had a strange harmonic to it, as though several people were speaking in cadence while swallowing gravel. There was a strange stutter-stop lilt to it. \" But war …is coming, stones not safe on earth anymore .\" As the creature spoke it made its way to the temple wall directly opposite of the Professor. With a surprisingly delicate movement from a creature so large and ungainly, it feathered a hand gently over the intricate carving, sweeping it back and forth before it came to a stop. Extending a single digit of its hand it stopped at one spot, the shape of its finger then seemed to waver like heat over pavement and it changed to the shape of a key. If a key had three faces instead of one. There was a deep clunk noise from within the walls then stone shifted on stone. Before the strange group was an entirely new antechamber, free of dirt and debris and clean as though it had been built the week before. Professor Pacoli's eyes swept back and forth, hardly able to contain himself and nearly vibrating with excitement. \"This! This is truly amazing!\" He was so intent on this newest discovery that he didn't even notice the birdlike head of the creature next to him swivel and stare before it moved quickly and quietly towards him. There was an intense ringing in the air, an unheard sound profoundly uncomfortable that could be felt in the bones. Professor Pacoli fell gently backwards, crumpling like a discarded kerchief. Mindful of the fallen body the creatures stepped into the antechamber, slowly, almost reverently. Father Abdullah, with a sorrowful glance at the Professor, followed. His ears rung slightly; that was the affect of the device used by Mondoshawan technology. Non-lethal instantaneous black out if used directly on the target and a nasty headache for everybody else within twenty feet. Those who were of a certain biological disposition, anyway. Daylight filtered down from a cleverly hidden hole, high in the temple's ceiling. Shafts of light lit the object in the center of the room; gleaming off the metallic surface. \" The fifth element !\" Father Abdullah said in awe. It had the shape of an iron coffin. Countless generations before him had been the guardians of this temple. They lived and died with only the vaguest ideas of what lay inside, living only with the knowledge that it must, must be kept safe at all costs. Now he was witnessing something no mortal eyes had ever seen before. The Mondoshawan turned its head back and forth working up the steam to communicate. \" Take…the stones .\" One by one the creatures lifted strangely carved statuettes and carefully put them into a lined chest. With this task done three of the Mondoshawan surrounded the coffin and the air hummed. What surely weighed over two tons floated gently off its pedestal then lay level with the ground. Then they simply walked out of the antechamber. Father Abdullah raised a tentative hand of beseechment and said, \"My Lord, if you take the stones we will be defenseless when evil returns!\" Stutter-grind. \" When… in three hundred years, evil returns… so shall we .\" A flash of light on metal caught Father Abdullah's eye. There was a raised gun, in the shaking hand of Billy Father Abdullah sucked in a breath, ready to shout to Billy to stop, wait, to explain away the terror in the boy's eyes but there was a loud round of multiple gunshots. The bullets ripped into the Mondoshawan behind him and the creature made a terrible noise that was animal agony and metal grinding on metal all rolled into one terrible scream. Liquid substance flowed freely from the holes. \"Billy, NO! You do not understand, they are our friends!\" Billy, shaking his head, backed away with shock and horror in his face. \"No, Father, no! They-they killed the Professor! They're monsters!\" Father Abdullah desperately reconciled his wits to calm the situation, to stop any more violence when there was a grinding noise. The Mondoshawan, critically wounded, had lost all concentration and in doing so had lost the ability to keep the secret door open. It was closing, with the creature inside it. Father Abdullah swayed helplessly, feeling as though too much was happening too fast. There was no way he could help the Mondoshawan; the weight was beyond a dozen men and it was bleeding its life into the unforgiving floor of the temple. \"Please, hurry, the wall is closing!\" Even with its life speeding away from it the Mondoshawan remained unhurried and made calm measured steps towards the priest. It drew a rattling breath as the doorway became smaller and smaller. \" Here… is your mission now, pass your knowledge… to the next priest as it was… to you .\" Father Abdullah wrung his hands in anguish and moaned, \"I will do as you command, of course! But please you must hurry, you still have time!\" \" Time… not important, only… life important .\" Father Abdullah could only watch helplessly as one of the ancient and great races of the universe expended its last bit of life energy to push forth its hand between the closing doors of stone. There was a sickening crunch as flesh, metal and bone was separated forcefully and the doors shut, leaving only the severed hand with the key. Outside the great temple the mooring that docked the unearthly spaceship slowly retracted itself as the Mondoshawan prepared to withdraw from the planet. The power generated from the immense vessel kicked up giant winds, blowing dust and sand in gale force winds. Father Abdullah stumbled from the entrance, clutching the precious key to his chest and raised his voice to the departing craft. \"I will fulfill my mission! I will pass on the knowledge until your return! !\" 300 Years Later The pride of the United Confederated Territories star born battle cruiser fleet, The Correction, drifted in the deep black quadrant of the Omega arm. For several weeks now small border terrestrial civilizations had been winking out of communication and a platoon had been dispatched, expecting any number of small inconveniences that often plague settlers pushing out into the vastness of space. What they found, however, was beyond their worst nightmares. Those who had made it back alive could barely string together coherent sentences. One Sergeant Rona could only continually shake his head back and forth repeating, \"I looked at the darkness and it looked back.\" It wasn't long after that he died; body mysteriously failing, organs shutting down one by one. It was now a matter of interstellar security which was how the crew aboard The Correction found themselves facing something never before seen by human eyes. Three hundred souls it took to run the battle ship and each and every one was pulling double duty. They had been sent by no less than the President himself and was a matter of pride to stop all threats before they came anywhere near the place they called home. All scanners indicated nothing; the mass that lay like a dark storm cloud gave away no secret, no reading nor output. The crew had begun to call it 'the anomaly' and remained on edge from the unnaturalness of it all. Nothing like it had ever been recorded in the history of space exploration. General Staedert stood at the helm, face grim. He was not a man that gave way to anxiety easily as his face showed; it was the face of someone with a long and rigid life full of discipline, valor and glory. It showed in every line wrinkle and scar. Steely eyes gazed out over the frantic exertion of his crew below him. \"Anything yet, Corporal Franzen?\" \"Nothing yet, sir.\" \"Not even a temperature?\" Corporal Franzen hesitated then reported, \"Thermal analyzer has jammed, one of them maxed out over one million degrees and the other shows minus five thousand.\" There was a moment of shocked disbelief. \"Let's see it; bring it up on visual.\" An image winked into view over the panel screen that covered the entire front deck of the control. Their position was approximately five clicks out from where the last communication was sent before they lost all contact. This particular solar systems sun burned orange, and before it, made starkly visible by the light, was a long stretch of darkness. Like a cancerous growth, it seemed to expand even as General Stadert watched. Diagnostics were all working ferverently, trying to get a reading. One looked up and said, \"It's taking a solid form…\" So it was; like something living, a planet sized storm of ash, heat, darkness and power. Almost like an eel it twisted then shrunk, giving off energy that snapped like dry heat lightening. Then it stopped. A perfect sphere of black. General Staedert squared his chin and said, \"Send out a probe then hail Control, the President will want an update.\" New York City, New United States Control Center Many billions of miles away there was a very intense meeting happening in which the highest of the high gathered. Though they did not realize it, today they would be deciding the course of history. \"Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the confederated territories.\" Everyone arose as he entered. An auditorium filled with dignitaries, generals, leaders of countries and planetary sovereigns all gathered for a single purpose. The President gave a grave nod of the head and took his seat in the center of the room. A staff member leaned over and murmured, \"On air with General Staedert in thirty seconds, sir.\" On the far side of the open atrium-styled auditorium Father Vito Cornelius cleared his throat nervously and stepped towards his allotted seat. The faces of his contemporaries gazed back at him, all grim and expectant. The signs had been clear; the end was near. Now it was just a matter of a millennia of passed down knowledge to see if life could be saved. Father Cornelius laid a hand on his young acolyte who started and jumped up out his seat. \"F-Father, I saved your seat!\" \"Good lad. Let us see what fate decides today.\" Aboard the Correction the lines of communication were open. \"General, the President is on the line. Ready for transmission.\" The President's voice came over the speaker's, slightly scratchy as though there were interference with the communication. \"I have to address the Supreme Council in ten minutes so just the facts, if you please.\" \"Yes, sir.\" said General Staedert. \"There are no results from the chemical analysis just yet. We are initiating thermal nuclear imaging just now.\" \"So what you are saying is you don't know what this thing is.\" There was a note of frustration in the President's voice that indicated some answers had better be found and soon. General Staedert replied, \"Not just yet, sir. All we know is it keeps getting bigger.\" \"Recommendation?\" There was a shark like quality to the grim grin stretching General Staedert's mouth. \"You know my philosophy Mr. President; shoot first and ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests\" Beside the President the long line of military force all nodded and murmured in consent. The President rubbed a weary hand over his face and said, \"All right. Proceed.\" From the multitudes of the crowd a wavering clear voice called, \"Mr. President?\" The crowd shifted and muttered to each other in surprised voices; who was this upstart who dared interrupt important matters? The staff aide beside the President efficiently ran a finger through a digital catalogue of guests and announced, \"Priest Vito Cornelius. Expert of astrophenomena.\" Now the crowd nodded and smirked to one another. The robes Father Cornelius wore was of an fringe order of religion that concentrated on history and theories of karma, respecting each blade of grass and all that other feel good claptrap. The good Father himself didn't seem like that imposing of a man; medium stature, a bland face that had the look of a benevolent scholar. Graying hair and a smattering of lines and wrinkles that bespoke of hard thinking and a life spent in thought. In other words a hermit monk. The room fell totally silent, waiting expectedly. \"I have a …different theory to offer you, sir.\" Father Cornelius stepped through the crowd, obviously discomforted by the sheer number of eyes upon him but held his chin up firmly and gained confidence as he continued to speak. The President gave him a mostly uninterested glance and looked at the time keeper on his desk. \"You have twenty seconds.\" Father Cornelius cleared his throat and brought his hands together, gathering his thoughts. \"Imagine for a moment that this…thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be. Where ever there is life it brings death. Because it is evil, absolute evil.\" The President snorted impatiently and waved a hand. \"All the more reason to shoot first-\" Father Cornelius was shaking his head sadly. \"Evil begets evil, Mr. President. Shooting it will only make it stronger.\" Within the last fifteen minutes the Correction had been observing the anomaly it had increased in size by roughly three times. The tension was now palatable aboard the vessel; all eyes were on the viewing screen. \"Probe will attain its objective in five seconds.\" General Staedert nodded and then swore abruptly; the signal had promptly disappeared. \"What happened!?\" \"Sir…it appears to be…shielded. Growth rate is at twenty seven percent.\" General Staedart clenched his jaw. The President shook his head and said dismissively, \"This is all very interesting, Father, but we don't have time to go into this.\" \"Time is of no importance, sir, only life is of importance.\" The President straightened in his chair, visibly annoyed. \"You're right! That's exactly what we're going to do; we're going to protect the life of some two hundred billion of my fellow citizens. Staedert, you may fire when ready.\" \"Roger.\" General Staedert signaled the missile launch crew who bent over industriously and began the attack. \"Upfront loading one-twenty Zion missile; Markolites on the objective.\" From the viewing screen the planet sized ball of black rippled, almost in response to the incoming hostilities aboard the Correction. The crew watched in horrified fascination as the crackled and fractured surface pulled itself together, fusing to create one solid mass on the surface, smooth as a ball bearing. As though it was creating a thick armored shield. There was a stunned moment of silence. The scientific exploration team onboard broke out in astonished exclaimations. \"Zero surface activity. Did you see that?! It just-\" Lab Technician Riggs turned to General Staedert with a look of disbelief. \"I think it's anticipating the attack. Anticipation denotes…intelligence. Sir….\" General Staedert gripped the railing above the command bridge as the conversation from Command came over the speaker. The priest was speaking again. \"The most terrible intelligence imaginable, President.\" The General felt a stab of irritation, wanting this thing blown from the universe and out of his hair, or rather, what was left of it. \"Staedert.\" \"Yes, Mr. President.\" \"I have a doubt.\" \"I don't, sir. Fire !\" Two one-twenty Zion missiles burst from the Correction and found their target, momentarily blinding the crew with the brilliance of the explosive aftermath. General Staedert leaned back and took a breath to issue the command to return but instead spat out an angry expletive. \"Sir! Target remains! It's…it's increased in size.\" The General could feel sweat trickling down his neck. This is what they called a career killer. If they failed here… \" Fire ! Double missiles, fire !\" Panic was threading its way through the Correction. People were abandoning their posts to watch the screen. The resulting explosion rocked the ship, vibrating violently, making people grab onto the nearest stable surface. The interface of the screen momentarily blanked out. Bated breath was held as the screen cleared and- \"…Planet has increased in diameter by two hundred percent and it's moving. Approaching in approximately two minutes. \" said Lab Technician Riggs quietly. General Staedert took off his garrison cap and mopped his face. \"What…what do we have that's bigger than the one-twenty?\" \"Nothing, sir.\" \" Staedert! I don't want an incident! Do you hear me?! Get out of there !\" The Presidents voice crackled over the speakers, sounding weak and far away. Black was rapidly filling the screen of the Correction and General Staedert watched death come for him. Distantly all around him he could hear things; the screams of his crew, the tinny scratchy voice of the President shouting ' Listen to me, this is the President, Get out of there, now! Staedert! ' But only the engulfing darkness covered his vision. He could hear a ringing in his ears. Or was it at the base of his head? It was difficult to tell but it vibrated like a buzz saw. Thick liquid dripped past his nose, down his neck and the General swiped a hand at it. Through the blanket of shocked disbelief he realized it was blood and the ringing in his ears had the undercurrent of malevolent laughter. Then there was nothing.[Chapter 2] Two South Brooklyn, New York In the dream there was fire and terror, and death. It was a familiar dream; one Major Korben Dallas has had plenty of times before. Nearly a lifetime of service in various armed forces had left its mark and Korben Dallas had scant reward but a few medals, plenty of nightmares and a yearly brunch with Colonel Hollander which was always awkward. Korben knew how this dream would go; watching as comrades went to their screaming end and air and breath would be choked off and there would be a blanket of darkness and…laughter? Korben lurched out of bed with a hoarse shout and groggily swatted at the alarm, which had been shrilly buzzing. That had been a new one. Generally, there wasn't much laughter in the dreams, nonetheless nasty, dark laughter that had sounded like it found the battlefield to be of great amusement. Running a shaking hand over a weary face, Korben stretched a body that had more than a few miles on it. It had served her well over the decades, nearly four of them. Korben had always been a scrappy fighter but training, physical confrontations and many a close call had left their calling card. She swung long, lean legs over the edge of the bed, stretching tense wiry muscles. Hardened limbs, strong shoulders and ample chest bore the roadmap of every knife that found its mark, every bullet that tore flesh and that one time she scrapped with a particularly nasty celestial strider that left an impressive set of scars running down her side. Bastard almost had her liver for lunch. The sterile gloomy depths of Korben's apartment greeted her and she gave shaky laugh. Everything was as she had left it the night before; one fifteen by twenty singles residence crammed full of much cheer as she could fit into the cell-like dwelling. Movement had set off the convection circuits in the maintenance system; lights flickered on, the coffee filter gurgled to life and the auto health dispensed one cigarette with the monotone electronic admonishment, \" Four a day. To quit is our goal! \" What was a silent tomb of a resident burst forth with sound and light. It was the only way Korben felt she could stomach living in a tube; graphic aquarium bubbling away and telebroadcast blaring. Her roommate certainly appreciated it. Speaking of which there was a light scratching at the door followed by a feline yowl and Korben pushed herself out of the bed with a heartfelt groan; it was going to be a long day, she could feel it in her bones. Almost in answer to that ominous thought process was the piercing ring of the telecommunicator, identifying the caller as 'Finger'. One of the few remaining soldiers she had worked with over the years, Finger had gotten out of the military and managed to scrape a living off of odd jobs around the city. Korben trusted him as she trusted few people; he was nearly as cunning and violent as she was, and that was saying something. \"All right, all right, all right ! I'm up!\" Korben jerked the device out of the wall and pushed a lit cigarette between her lips. \"Yeah?\" \"Hey, Dogbreathe. Finger here.\" The yowling had increased in pitch and Korben slid the door open, emitting a slender white cat that promptly wrapped itself around her ankles, purring. \"Hey, sweetie.\" Finger snorted over the line. \"I love you too, Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.\" \"Not you, I was talking to the cat.\" \"Huh. That's right, I forgot; you'd rather have the furball than a real companion.\" Korben took a long drag and almost groaned again at the sheer bliss of a nicotine rush first thing in the morning. Decidedly in a better mood she said, \"Well, at least the cat comes back.\" \"You still upset over that two-timing dick? Forget about him, Major, there are a million fish in the sea.\" Inevitably Korben's eyes slid to the one shelf in the tiny space, drawn to her wedding photo. That day she was certain she had found a new life, finally able to bury the nightmares and bloodshed. It hadn't taken long for reality to come crashing down around her ears. \"-Major, Major ! You're looking at that damn photo again aren't you!? Why don't you toss that thing out like a sane person?\" Korben pushed the frame down. \"I don't want a million fish, Finger. Just one. One perfect one.\" \"Hah. Don't exist, Major.\" She made an indistinct, noncommittal grunt of agreement. This conversation was treading into distinctly emotional territory that Korben didn't want to go. She picked up the photo next to the fallen one. \"Eurgh.\" \"What?\" \"Just found a photo of you.\" \"Oh yeah? How do I look?\" A mean smile curved around Korben's lips. \"Like shit.\" \"Well, must be an old photo. Listen, you gotta bring the cab in for the six month overall.\" \"Negative.\" Korben pushed herself away from the wall and aggressively opened the tiny fridge door. Not much there either; breakfast was shaping up to be leftover Italian, a couple packets of ketchup and a solitary cocktail onion floating forlornly in a jar. Finger sighed impatiently, used to the Major's personality quirks. \"Sooner than later, Major.\" \"Don't need it.\" Korben muttered around an onion. \"Don't give me that shit, I know how you drive. Sat next to you for a thousand missions, yeah?\" Korben straightened, lighting another cigarette. \"Finger. I'm not a space fighter anymore.\" \"All right, okay. So tell me; how many points you got left on your license?\" \"Mmm, at least fifty.\" \" Hah , still horrible at lying I see. See you tonight.\" Korben pushed the telecommunicator back into place and met the feline stare of Snowball. \"What?\" True to the feline breed, Snowball turned in complete disinterest and settled onto a cushion to watch the graphics lighting up the broadcast screen by the front door. Korben watched a moment in idle interest as a scantily clad woman opened convivial arms and said, \"Welcome to paradise!\" Korben snorted, recognizing another promo for Radio Cosmo and busied herself with a cup of coffee while words washed over – \"Welcome to Phloston paradise! This is Ruby Rodd, your main man and I will tell you live at five the name of the winner of the super green Gemini croquet contest! The winner will hang with me for two days in Phloston Paradise! So tune into Radio Cosmo…\" Keys? Check. Boots? Tied. Pocket Annihilator? Check. Multipass? Check. Ready for another day in the jungle, Korben thought wryly and tapped on a screen next to the door. A filtered black and white image showed the derelict hallways clear of any presence. \"Don't watch it all day, sweetie, it'll rot your brain.\" Korben walked out the door and straight into the barrel of a shorthand assault rifle. She jerked back in momentary surprise and with trained precision assembled the situation given before her. Camouflage; ingeniously done. Some clever soul had taken a perfect replica photo of the outside hallway and fashioned some sort of hat out of it so it fooled the apartment visual feed. The hands were then free to grip the barrel and trigger of the weapon. Shaky hands. Male. Young. Emaciated. Scraggly beard, bloodshot eyes. Erratic twitching. Local junkie. And Korben relaxed. This was old hat; one of those city things that were all part of the local flavor. Big lights, big crowds and plenty of muggings to go around. \"G-gimme the caasshhhhhh!\" The words were ground out through clenched teeth. Korben put her hands in the air, radiating calm amusement. Poor bastard must be desperate to try door to door mugging. Ah well, this made for a pleasant diversion from the black edges of the nightmare she had just woken up from. \"Been here long?\" The weapon moved in little jerks and twitches while the sunken in face and wild eyes of the junkie tried to process Korben's lack of fear. \"Y-yeah, yeah – ages, been here ages. Now gimme the cash!\" \"Is that a Z-140? Alleviated titanium, new charge assault model. Not bad, not bad.\" Nope, definitely not going as planned. Most people by now would have pissed themselves with fear with the serious hardware shoved in their faces but this hard faced bitch just stood there and looked at him . \"Hm. Good thing it isn't loaded.\" Wait – \"What? What d'you mean it's not loaded?!\" The junkie cum mugger risked a glance down. \"Well, you have to…push the little yellow button to load it.\" Korben pointed a helpful finger to the side of the weapon. The junkie let out a high pitched nervous peal of laughter, man his brain must be really fried if he hadn't noticed something as simple as that. He slid a finger along the side, pushing the little yellow button into place with a click. Good thing his victim here was so helpful – wait. \"GIMME THE CASSHHH!\" With one smooth movement Korben gripped the end of the barrel and the junkie's hand twitched, pulling the trigger. Nothing came out but a disappointed queeb sound and the stock still silence that followed. With a decidedly rough grin Korben pulled the Pocket Annihilator and trained it right square between the eyes, watching with a small amount of satisfaction as they went from glassy and desperate to glassy, desperate and terrified. She reached around behind her and typed in the code for the Front Door Arsenal, which smoothly folded out of the ceiling. Well, it had been one of those new features installed in most apartments which gave you a handy place for your shoes and wallet but Korben had imagined a better purpose for it and renamed it appropriately. \"Now that's a very dangerous gun. Maybe you better let me have it.\" The junkie's eyes twitched back and forth between the gun in his face and the overstocked weapons cache that had popped out of the ceiling. \"Don't mind, do you?\" \"N-no, man. Take it, take it !\" \"You sure?\" \"Take it, I don't need it !\" Free of his burden the junkie backpedaled a couple of steps, doing a weird little jig dance. Like he had ants crawling up his legs. Hell, maybe in his strung out mind he did. Korben felt a sudden stab of pitied amusement towards the wretched creature who stood before her and fought to keep the laugh rising out of her throat. \"That's..hem, that's a very nice hat you have there.\" The junkie looked pleased. He grinned bashfully and choked out, \"You like it!?\" Yup, another day in the concrete jungle. \" Please enter your license.\" Korben fiddled with the combustion barometer, pushing dials into place. The latest model of Zorg Inc. Inner City Cabby was cheaply put together and required a creative touch on a cold morning to start up the engine circuits. \" Please enter your license.\" \"Yeah, yeah – I heard you the first time.\" Korben slid the slim piece of plastic and circuitry into the cabs key engine slot and the machine grumbled to life. She could feel the hum in the boards beneath her feet as it warmed up. \" Wecome aboard, Korben Dallas. How are you today?\" The automated onboard personal assistant sounded just as perky and annoying as she had the first day Korben had taken up the job. \"Had a horrible nightmare, thanks for asking. Propulsion levels rising...auxiliary stable. And away we go.\" The bay doors opened and Korben was grateful for a cab that had its own air recycle unit; some older models of aerovehicles didn't, back in the good old days before people had realized the lethality of the fogs of Lower New York. Korben spared a disinterested glance down. Below the current city line of lights and rush of traffic was billowing clouds of murkiness; black and eerie with the occasional discharge of built up energy. New York had always been packed to the brim with people, opportunities and concrete but there came a point in the last couple of centuries when there just wasn't any more space to be had. The planet was overpopulated, and the flux of out-of-galaxy visitors had just added to the problem. The solution had been to build up . Ingeniously making a new city atop the old one. Korben released the anchor and the cab drifted upwards. \" You have…. five points …left on your license.\" \"And thank you for reminding me.\" she grumbled. \" Have a nice day .\" \"We have forty-eight hours, Mr. President.\" Grim faces looked back at Father Vito Cornelius. The summit had been dispersed with promises of constant updates on the impending disaster and the President, a few select Military personal and Father Cornelius had retired to a private room. Spread out before them was a leather bound tome that took up most of the space of the table in which they sat at. Father Cornelius rested his hands over the page that was filled with archaic writing and a rough drawing depicting humans reaching towards a light. \"That's the time needed to adapt to our living conditions.\" The President folded his hands and rested a square cut chin on them. \"And then?\" Cornelius hesitated. \"Then it will be too late. The goal of this thing is not to fight for money or power, Mr. President, but to exterminate life. All forms of life.\" There was discontented murmuring from the background. The President sighed and rubbed a weary hand over his face. \"So what you're telling me, Father, is there's nothing that can stop this thing.\" Father Cornelius smiled triumphantly and pushed the tome towards the President. \"Not quite, Mr. President. For hundreds of centuries men of my order have been the caretakers of a very great secret. We have knowledge of one thing that may save us all. There is a race in the universe so old, so knowledgeable, so compassionate that it is said they were the first born in the entire history of existence. Some called them angels, others called them caretakers but whatever name any society has given them they remain our greatest hope.\" \"You're talking about the Mondoshawans.\" \"Correct, Mr. President! The Mondoshawan have in their possession the only weapon to defeat evil. Four elements gathered around a fifth…a Supreme Being.\" Father Cornelius briefly pointed a finger at the illustration in the book. Four priests holding something in their hands, surrounding a blinding figure of light. \"The ultimate warrior, created to protect life. Together they produce what the ancients called the Light of Creation, able to bring life to the farthest reaches of the universe. But. If evil stands there…\" \"Then what?\" Cornelius folded his hands in his lap, dropping the words like leaden stones. \"Then light turns to dark, life to death, forever.\" There was resounding silence in the room. Someone cleared their throat. \"Mr. President. There is a Mondoshawan spacecraft at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory.\" The President stood and replied, \"Give them permission along with my warmest regards.\" \"Sir.\" Father Cornelius smiled. Things were looking up; if the Mondoshawan were here then that meant they stood a chance after all. \"Thank you, Mr. President.\" The planet that lay before them glowed cerulean against the black of space; same as it had been for countless millennia. The ship waited patiently at the borders of Earth, marked by two stations that guarded the gateway. A journey was nearly complete and the good Shepherds of Creation were relieved to lay down their weary burden. Some of the Mondoshewan aboard were amongst some of the oldest creatures in existence. Only the Face of Boe outranked them in sheer enlightenment and age. Theirs was a race that had existed only for order in a universe full of dark chaos. As it so happens with many sentient creatures, time, age and experience gave way to an all encompassing understanding of all spaces. The ability to read and empathically understand the space you occupy is a tribute shared among all highly developed consciousness, including the Mondoshewan, who had turned it into an art form. This was probably why they felt the ripples of darkness before the first blast of propelled G-Force 540 missiles slammed into the side of the ship, sending it listing to one side. Fire blossomed in the vacuum of the space, metal twisted and screeched under the assault and the Mondoshewan desperately tried to counteract the impending attack. The first volley of projectiles had expertly knocked out the systems shielding; they were sitting ducks. From the helm the Mondoshewan watched as a handful of sleek fighter vessels swerved and came back around for a final deadly attack. In those last moments, with flame and death burning in their collective consciousnesses, the Mondoshewan let out one final telepathic bellow, shrieking out terror and anger. The Fifth Element, the final hope for creation, went down in flames. \"We are lost.\" The words fell from an utterly defeated Father Cornelius as he laid slumped back into his seat, shock turning his face ashen and vacant. The War Cabinet and President looked at the man with pity; he had been repeating those words for the last half hour while they awaited reports from the rescue crew sent to scavenge the remains that had landed on the far side of earth's moon. \"Sir, the attack was launched by two unregistered war ships. As soon as the Mondoshewan's ship went into the moon they disappeared. We sent tracers to detect the plasma trail left by the engines but we have no confirmation of region or make yet.\" \"Close all boarders declare a state of general alert.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"Try to make contact with the Mondoshewan; we owe them an explanation.\" \"Sir.\" \" Three hundred years of waiting….for nothing. \" The President turned and said, not without kindness, \"You should go home now and get some rest, Father. We'll take it from here.\" Father Cornelius straightened and said, \"No! I- I am the Mondoshewan's contact on earth! They will need me-\" \"This is government business now, Father. We will likely be launching an all out war; something that you should have no part of. I will keep you informed as necessary.\" \"But-\" \"Please see that Father Cornelius and his young acolyte make home safely.\" As the Father and his young servant were ushered firmly out the door protesting and unwilling, one last snatch of conversation could be overheard. \"We have a report, Sir.\" \"And? Any survivors?\" \"Just one.\" The President sighed. \"Thank God for small favors. Now the question is who sent those warships?\" A single perfect azure fingernail was being carefully considered. It took special dedication to transform hands into a higher form of art and Charlotte was dedicated. She fit into the general décor of the high rise office; stylish, cold, meticulous and beautiful. Charlotte flicked the tiny paint brush against another fingernail and put her hand high to admire the effect, pausing as the telecomunicator rang genteelly in the meditative silence of the waiting room. \"Mr. Zorg's office, how may I be of help?\" There was a long moment, then grumbling static, as though the caller was reaching out through an electric storm. \"This…is Aagnahd.\" Oh, one of those calls. Charlotte hit the call waiting button and pushed the signal through to Mr. Zorg's direct line. Certainly, there was mysterious things in her line of work; large exchanges of money, strange, untimely deaths but Charlotte wasn't paid to notice things, merely to look pretty for Mr. Zorg and take phone calls. Something she did very well. Several rooms away a man stood framed by an antique Tiffany glass window that overlooked the sprawling sky high city of Upper New York. The sun lit noxious fumes prettily in golds and reds, alighting the reflective windows of skyscrapers the same. Hands folded behind his back, back straight, head high it could be said his stature wasn't extremely imposing. Average height, average build, expensive taste in clothing and an avid interest in the latest fashions that thrive in New York; the latest being plastic head gear that required the shaving of one side of the head. It made for a startling contrast for Zorg; perfectly maintained inky black locks on one side of his pallid face while the other side of his head was covered by a sheet of clear plastic. It brought to mind warriors of the ancient world who would partially shave the head save for one patch of hair. In the silence of the room there was a small sound. Zorg smiled, lightly pressing the communicator button and said, \"I'm so glad to hear from you, Aagnahd.\" There was a lilt to the voice; a voice that was deceivingly convenial and warm. Beneath it, however, was an undercurrent of gleeful greed. \"The mission is accomplished. We have what you asked for.\" \"Good, good . Well done, bravo! I will meet you in my factory.\" The line went dead and Zorg chuckled gleefully to himself. He pressed another button. \"Charlotte, get my coat. I'm going…out for a while.\" Nucleolab, New York City \"You call that a survivor?\" The question was voiced by General Monroe. One of the President's most trusted staff he had unquestionable long experience in military service and was a veteran of many battles and skirmishes. There was doubt in his voice. He was currently walking quickly down one of the many corridors of a secret government sanctioned facility that dealt with the medicine and science field. Beside him was a team of their best scientists, all crowded around a metal trolley being moved quickly towards one of the medical stations. Within the hermetically sealed clear container on the trolley was a severed hand, encased in something that looked like a gauntlet. Ragged bits of flesh and bone trailed out of the metal shell, the rest of the owner nowhere to be found. \"Your doubt is understandable, General, but I assure you a few living cells is all I need.\" General Monroe cast a speculative eye over the doctor's face. What was his name again? Township, Townsell…no Townsend, that was it! Doctor Townsend had met Monroe's recovery team with glee; fully equipped with things that Monroe hadn't the slightest clue what they did. The doctor was almost beside himself. It wasn't everyday you got to fiddle with Mondoshewan technology. The room they entered was enormous. High rounded ceiling with huge vents. Well, Monroe theorized, one would need all the vents because all of the equipment. He had heard about this thing, the Cellular Reconstruct Biomotive. Hell, he remembered all the protests that broke out over the cost of having one; despite being one of the richest countries on this side of the galaxy it had put them into five years of debt. To bring life at the touch of a button. \"And, uh, have you identified what it is yet?\" Doctor Townsend turned a manically gleeful face towards Monroe and he almost recoiled. These science types were always too fanatical for him, their obsessions were beyond him. Give him a nice simple war any day. \"We tried but the computer went off the charts. You see, normal human beings have forty DNA memo groups which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself.\" He stroked a loving hand over the cold glass container. \" This has two hundred thousand memo groups.\" Monroe felt a twinge of unease. He didn't like the sound of this; it was nearing too close to monster territory. If they resurrected something they couldn't handle he was going to put a bullet in it. The staff busied themselves with the machinery, flipping switches, exchanging phrases that sounded like foreign speech to Monroe. Finally the glass container was carefully opened and the severed hand reverently placed in the dome coffin of the Biomotive. Monroe snorted and replied, \"This thing sounds like a freak of nature to me.\" Doctor Townsend rubbed his hands together, staring greedily at the container. \"Yup. Can't wait to meet him!\"[Chapter 3] Three /Oh my GOD I am so sorry it took so, so long to get back to this. Sadly, this is one of those things where you start a project then a lot of other things happen and you lose interest/are not certain where it's going and the next thing you know its been over a year since you've looked at it. But, I was reading over what I wrote and decided its a project worth continuing. This is a wonderful movie to have as an novelization. I hope you guys stick with me, because I WILL finish it/ Deep in a government run facility life was being created. The room sized generators hummed with vibrating energy, making conversation difficult. General Monroe watched, enraptured, by the fanatical glow of Doctor Townsend's face as he rattled off scientific terms that buzzed through the General's ears like water through a sieve. Beside them assistants were doing complicated looking procedures; making adjustments, flipping switches and finally carefully taking the severed hand and placing it into a metal tray filled with some liquid-like substance. Okay, General – over here.\" Doctor Townsend steered General Monroe over to the large control panel, all glowing buttons, complicated beyond than what Monroe was comfortable with. \"Let me show you something – this is a normal human DNA chain, okay? You, me anybody. Right? Watch this.\" Townsend fingers flew over the command board, bringing up the holomonitor and displayed a dizzyingly complex three dimensional model of a DNA chain. It was all Greek to Monroe and he grunted his committal to cover how out of depth he felt. The doctor took no notice but continued to talk, giving the model an almost a loving look. At the touch of a button he brought up another picture, this one almost double the strands of the previous. \"Compositional elements of his DNA chain is the same of ours, but there's simply more of them, tightly packed with infinite genetic knowledge. Almost like this being was…engineered.\" General Monroe hadn't ever been much of a fan of classic monster themes and this was starting to take on a Frankenstein-esque quality that didn't sit well with him. Doubt was crawling in the back of his mind, making him itchy to hit the self-destruct button. He shifted uncomfortably. \"Is there any danger?\" \"No, no, no! We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is, for lack of a better word perfect .\" Doctor Townsend breathed the last word with rapture. The oversized coffin-like lid of the machine before them shut, mechanical components coming to life, shifting, spinning over the giant tube that held the remnants of creation's last hope. General Monroe bent over the control panel flipping up a plastic protective case in which an ominous red button rested. \"….okay. Go ahead. But Mr. Perfect better be polite otherwise I'm going to turn him into cat food.\" Running his high security multi-pass through the high security recognition circuit a light lit inside the red button, signaling the first stage of auto-destruct. Doctor Townsend let out a quivering breath and said, \"Activate it.\" Mechanical implements, rods and levers came to life. The mechanical hands of the machine gurgled as the protein extract compound was funneled through the tiny opening which rebuilt the skeleton frame of the inhabitant in the glass coffin. The entire team and Monroe watched the monitor as it gave an animated version of what was going on inside the machine. Monroe watched in a sort of horrified fascination as a human form was created from nothing but the compounds found in a glass beaker. The skeleton was complete, more delicate looking than what Monroe was expecting; the limbs seemed stretched out, longer than what an ordinary humans would be. \"Tissue processing.\" It was a mechanical dance that wove sinew and muscle like the skilled hands of a weaver piecing together a rug. In mere moments the frame of the body had bulk, organs and a heart which did not yet beat. \"Ten seconds to ultraviolet protection.\" Doctor Townsend made a little humming sound of pure joy then, apparently unable to not share his unbridled enthusiasm, turned to Monroe with a shining face, running the words together in his effort to get them out. \"This is the last phase. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body to react, protect itself, that means growing skin.\" Monroe grunted his disgust. \"Wonderful.\" Just as abruptly as it started the machine stopped, all components folding back into place as the generators powered down. \"Reconstruction complete.\" There was a hushed moment of palatable tension. Doctor Townsends hands gripped the console tightly. \"Remove the shield.\" Shapely feet, long limb and muscle of the calves and thighs. Lightly muscled like a professional swimmer. A flat hard stomach that rose to a moderately defined chest and finally to the restfully sleeping face of a young man. Monroe stared, stunned. This wasn't what he was expecting in someone that was supposed to be the 'savior' of creation. The man before him wasn't the great behemoth hulk he was hoping for; something with muscles so big it would take an artillery round to do any damage. This man was more like a schoolboy. He rounded on Townsend, anger and dismay written on his face. \"What is this?! This thing is supposed to fight? It looks like a stiff breeze could knock him over!\" Doctor Townsend was greedily staring at the created form before them. \"I told you already, General, the sensors have indicated this being is beyond what appearances may seem. Remember? Perfect .\" His hand gripped General Monroe's wrist that still hovered over the destruct button and raised an eyebrow. Grudgingly, Monroe removed his hand. \"Thermal bandages.\" White hygienic strips of cloth were mechanically rolled over vital points of the immobile body, tiny sensors woven into the cloth automatically activating and bringing the internal temperature up to 96.8 degrees. There was a flash and the smell of ozone. 1,700 volts of electricity were delivered to the still heart, shocking it into true life. Monroe and everyone in the room jumped as the body of the man arched, his head jerking back and gasping breathes rattling through his chest. The aftershocks of being electrocuted made the limbs jerk and flail as the newly created body was painfully brought to full life. The hurt he was feeling was evident as blood began to flow and circulate, air inflated the unused lungs and consciousness clawed its way through the shock of being born. Monroe almost felt a stab of pity as he watched the creature twist and thrash, almost as though he was trying to claw his way out of the terrible pain he seemed to be experiencing. Finally the body stilled, the eyes which had no sense of awareness focused and he seemed to realize he was in a strange place with strange eyes upon him. He lurched up and cracked his head on the glass dome that still covered the bed of the machine. Clutching the throbbing point with one hand he blindly pushed and scratched at the glass lid that kept him trapped with the other hand, futilely trying to find an opening. Quickly he realized that he was trapped and after wedging himself in a corner he began to speak. He honestly had a pleasant voice, distorted it was by fear and anger. Low but not harsh. Not a word could be understood. \"Huh.\" Monroe slipped the multi-pass out of the slot before him, staring at the prisoner inside the glass. \"What's he saying?\" Doctor Townsend shook his head. \"I don't know. Activate the phonic detector.\" It was difficult to feel any fear towards this scared and scrawny thing that huddled in the corner of the machine like a rat in a cage. Monroe turned to the doctor and pointed to the machine, asking, \"Is that thing solid?\" Doctor Townsend gave him a questioning look. \"Unbreakable.\" \"Good.\" The face of the young man before him was exotic looking. No particular nationality to compare it to but delicate looking. It would have been almost feminine if it weren't for the angular jaw and largish nose. The eyes were a vivid blue, rather like looking into a pool of tropical water. The hair was a bit of a mystery; blonde at the roots but the ends of the short, spiky collection of hairs was an unnatural orange color that was set off by the dark complexion of the skin. Monroe approached him, smirking with the superior position he knew he held the man stilled, looking deeply into Monroe's face. Ha, this was better than visiting the zoo. Vindictive amusement had Monroe rap on the glass with his knuckles, the trapped occupant flinching at the sound. Monroe dangled the multipass back and forth and said, \"If you want out, Mr. Perfect, you're going to have to learn to develop those language skills .\" Enunciating each word with a swing of the multipass the man trapped in the glass cage watched each pass with growing anger, eyes narrowing. Monroe had no time to react; there was the splintering and shattering of glass as a fist was put through the barrier that lay between the two. Before anybody had any time to register shock the man firmly grasped the lapels of Monroe's jacket and brought his forehead down with considerable force onto the glass plate. As Monroe slid into inexorable unconsciousness he noted with surprised anger that his prisoner had lifted his multipass card and was sliding it through the lock at the base next to the hole he had punched. How … ? The machine lifted the lid as warnings blared over the speakers. The savior of creation scooted back off the edge of the machine, eyes darting to the frantic engineering workers, to Townsend, to the personnel flooding in from the front of the lab. He backed away and then took off into a dead run. Doctor Townsend watched in admiration and astonishment as his creation flung himself through the fiber insulation that covered the back wall. Had he known that through the insulation led to the service pipes? He shook his head and laughed. \" Perfect !\" The entire building was on a code red alert; lights flashed, the alarm blared and the cramped hallways swarmed with armed guards. The Captain stopped before the assembled team and barked out, \"A team come with me, B team hit the ventilation.\" \"Sir! Yes, sir!\" Wary eyes watched from above in the sheltered shadows of a ventilation pipe. This was the stuff made of nightmares; the mind behind the body was swimming in disorientation and fear. Trapped in a place with tight corners, boxed in by ceiling and wall and surrounded by creatures who radiated hostile and aggressive intent wasn't the most pleasant of ways to regain consciousness. The last thing burned into memory was fire and the death screams of his companions and protectors. The confusion in his heart and mind made reading his surroundings difficult. There- some ways away he could feel the draft of moving air. It had a strange tang to it; heavy, acidic and foul but fresher than the air in this tiny space. He put his fist through flimsy metal and easily dropped the twelve feet from his hiding place, landing lightly on his feet. Some more twists and turns of endless steel piping of the innards of the building and he found the source of fresh air. There was a slight quiver to his hand as he pushed open the grate leading to the outside and he jumped as a grating voice said, \"HALT! This is the police! There is nowhere to go! You will slowly turn around and -\" The language of his captors was harsher and more guttural compared to his own; it would take some doing before he was able to completely understand what was being said. As it were the manner and posture of this guard was weak and not worth taking note of. The world's savior gave a disinterested sniff and pushed himself out onto the ledge of the building. \"-he doesn't understand.\" grumbled the policeman. \"All units – we have a need for a flying unit here, south side of-\" Stepping outside the enclosed spaces of the building was like a slap to the face. It was all too much, too soon. Noise, smell, sound assaulted newly made senses and the man let out an animal groan as heart and lungs stuttered and gasped at the shock. Too many people, too many voices, all mixed together screaming, swirling confusing to senses far too sensitive to deal with this much culture shock all at once. He could only brace himself against the rough stone siding of the building and try not to crumble into a ball of quivering emotion. Through numbed and reeling senses he saw a vehicle rise from the flow of traffic below as voices boomed out over an intercom. \"This is the police. We are processing your identification please put your arms up and follow instructions.\" The man put his arms up, but only to try and shield himself from the sudden flood of bright white light coming from the vehicle. From inside squad car B452 Sergeant Medias gaped in confusion at the console screen of the vehicle. The Upper New York Police had a record of every human being born on the planet, along with outer terrestrial visitors who call earth home. Every person should be on record. Every single one. It was mandated by the world government over a century ago and yet, this man, this strange exotic looking creature wasn't on file . \"He… doesn't have a file!\" his partner observed. Both gaped out the window at the orange haired creature shielding himself from the flood lights. The Hero of Humanity knew he stood upon a precipice in more than one way. This civilization, if one could call it that, was very primitive and very hostile. It was obvious that if he let himself be taken it would hinder his true reason for existing, caught up in a web of distrust, small-minded self-importance and greed. He could not let this be. He called upon the part of himself that had an infinite connection to the cosmic beyond – a feeling of purpose and light that had guided him since his creation. It was asking him to have faith, to take a deep breath and – Sergeant Medias jumped and swore. \"He dove off! All units! All units! We have a jumper!\" He rattled off instructions as he pushed the squad car into high gear and went after the jumper. That crazy bastard, what the hell was he thinking!? Korben was in the middle of another day in the sky jungle; lots of fast paced business people going about their way, plenty of attitude and zero lunch breaks. Korben's stomach growling was enough of a reason to get onto the skyway heading south, towards that little Italian place she had been coming to for the last couple of months. She tapped a finger against the propulsion gauge, vainly trying to coax some more pressure into the system when an explosive force sent the cab careening into a spiral. Korben instinctively grabbed the wheel and twisted it in a circle, keeping herself from slamming into the delivery truck beside her. Spewing curses Korben expertly navigated the tangled weave of rush hour traffic, missing collision numerous times by scant inches. \"Damn! SORRY, dammit !\" She twisted the wheel the other way, ignoring the one finger salute the car she had nearly broadsided gave her. Warnings shrieked, lights flashed and the automated system repeated, \"YOU HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT. PULL OVER AT THE EARLIEST CONVIENENCE. YOU HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.\" \"Yes, I KNOW I had an accident you daffy bastard!\" she hissed. Finally she got the vehicle under control and out of immediate danger, pulling into a rest stop a few hundred feet away where something had impacted the cab. Korben took a couple of deep breathes, willing her heart to slow down and rubbed her hands over a weary face. If that was a person, some damned fool jumper, that had just demolished her cab she could expect a not-so-pretty sight. Good thing she was used to it. Turning around Korben catalogued the damage. It wasn't as bad as it could have been. Of course the roof was a total loss having been flimsy to begin with, and the seat was broken at an angle, having taken the brunt of the impact. She could make out a pair of skewed legs and an arm gripping the ruined backrest. Raising an eyebrow Korben asked dubiously, \"Any survivors?\" To her complete astonishment a head popped up and an infectious grin spread across his face. Korben couldn't help but stare; this young man was quite unlike any person she had ever seen and the attraction was instantaneous. Age was always a hard thing to judge but she guessed him to be in his late twenties, maybe younger. He was a shapely thing – even features, long limbs, lightly muscled made all the more evident by the strange get-up was wearing that barely covered anything. Bright blue eyes were made all the more vivid with dark skin a shock of blonde-orange hair stood up in messy spikes. Korben felt an unwilling smile tug her face. He looked at her like a drowning person who had spotted solid land and it was a nice feeling. He laughed and began to speak. Nothing that Korben could understand, he must have been some kind of foreigner but she liked the ways his eyes lit up and that his face was very expressive. There was one word that she could pick out. \"Ha. Yeah, 'boom' I understand. Big boom.\" He paused, rolling the words around in his mouth. \"Big…. Booooom..\" \"That's right. You don't speak English, huh? Pity. You're lucky to be alive, you know that?\" There were flashing lights as several cop squad cars suddenly pulled up beside them and Korben raised an eyebrow. That was surprisingly fast, for the cops. They must have been right on top of her to have showed up so quickly. \"This is the police. Please keep your hands on the wheel. You have an unauthorized passenger in the vehicle we are going to arrest her, thank you for your cooperation.\" Sighing, she put her hands on the wheel and waited for the grappling tendons to connect the vehicles. Glancing at the mirror she saw the young man's face crumple with distress and Korben tried to ignore the twisting in her gut. \"Sorry.\" She said quietly. He started to speak urgently, pointing towards the cop cars looking at Korben as though she was supposed to do something. She pressed her lips together. It was hard enough keeping this shitty job, and Finger would have a thing or two to say…. \"Look, it's best you just… do what they say, all right?\" Korben jerked her eyes forward, away from the terrible beseeching eyes of her passenger and said, more to herself than anything, \"I only got one point left on my license, and I need that to get back to the garage and have a…a six month over haul. You understand right?\" It sounded weak to her own ears and she almost hated herself for saying it. The cables from the squad car attached itself to the lower foot rest outside the cab. Any moment and they would have the side door open and be off with their prize. As if drawn by some terrible force Korben's eyes were brought back to her passenger. As a lifetime aficionado of human suffering Korben had seen desperation and fear across all spectrums, during some pretty terrifying encounters and the face that looked back at her was the face of a man pleading with his soul. The police officer was reaching across the shortened gap between cars. \" Fuck . Finger's gonna kill me.\" Korben jammed the gears and stomped on the accelerator, rocketing out of the rest stop like a bat out of hell, the cables from the squad car dangling like a banner. The man gasped and laughed, pressing a hand against the glass divider of the cab. Korben had to tear her eyes away from his face, which was ecstatic and weeping and she knew with a gut-wrenching feeling that she might have just fallen in love.

Prologue: It was the end ofntheir story according to the world. But to Korbon Dallas and hisnnewly wed wife Leloo, it was merely the beginning. They wed exactlynthree months after Leloo saved the world and one year later, they hadna baby girl. Alyx was the perfectnchild. She was quiet, patient and beautiful. She had her mother'snhair color and her eye color and she had her fathers smile. Thingsnseemed to be going perfect for this little happy family. But when Alyx turnednfive Leloo became deathly ill. She could hardly move and every timenshe inhaled she hurt herself. After two days of this the priests camenand took her away. ' Korbon wasnholding her hand. \"Go home Cornelius. I'll take her to a doctor,nshe'll be fine.\" He said sadly rubbing the top of her hand withnthis thumb. She slowly opened her eyes and looked to her daughter whonwas sitting on the floor looking at her mother. \" No, no, no. Korbon. We must take her back.nHe time here is up- if we don't then next time the evil returnsnthen the world will end.\" The priest looked at Alyx. \"She couldnhave died giving birth to your daughter- now she will die if we don'tntake her.\" Alyx looked up to her mother. \" Mommy?\" She asked quietly. The little girlnwas now standing and looking at her mother. Korbon took his daughternand picked her up. \"Come on Alyx, you need to go to your room andnplay.\" He said sadly. He carried her off to her room down the hall.nWhen he returned- Leloo was gone. That was the last he saw of her. When Alyx was eightnKorbon started noticing that she could lift as heavy loads as him,nshe could understand other languages and she could run faster thannother children her age. When she was ten Korbon took her to seenPriest Cornelius. \"Korbon-\" Thenpriest said two days later. \"You don't understand what you andnLeloo have done.\" He paused and looked into Alex's eyes- thennstood and looked to Korbon. \"Alyx is a half-element. She has allnthe power Leloo had.\" He took a step closer to Korbon. \"I need tontake her and raise her from here on. She is now no longer yournresponsibility.\" The last thing Alyxnwas told from her father was \"Alyx, will you go talk to David for anminute? I'll be there in a minute or two.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter one \"Cornelious?\" Alyxnasked peeking her head into the priest's office. The priest lookednup to her. She had the same bright orange hair as her mother had andnthe same smile as her father. She was a gorgeous girl but the priestnkept her in his apartment. If people found out what she was theynwould try and kill her. They tried to kill her mother- and they wouldntry and kill her. \"For heaven's sakenAlyx- how many times have I told you to call me 'Father' orn'Priest Cornelious'?\" He asked standing up. \"What is it?\"nHe asked quietly meeting her gaze. \"There is a man atnthe door for you.\" She said. She smiled. \"If you need me to savenyou and David from solicitors again let me know, I'll be at thencomputer.\" She then turned and left. \"Don't hack intonany hotels again.\" The priest said walking towards the door. Henfroze when he saw who it was. There were two mennstanding there. One of them was Korbon himself- the other was nonenother than Ruby Rod. Both were talking quietly and looked up to thenpriest as he approached. Korbon looked sadly at the priest. \"My own daughterndoesn't even recognize me.\" He said bitterly. \"It's only beennfive years, and she doesn't recognize me?\" He took a slow stepntowards the priest. \"What have you done to her?\" He asked anlittle bit louder. \"What have you done to my daughter?\" David walked in justnthen. He paused then stuttered. \"K-k-Korbon.\" Korbon looked tonDavid, then to Cornelious. The wrinkles starting on Korbon's facenwere cold and hard. \"What have you beennteaching my daughter? Why doesn't she even recognize me?\" Henasked almost yelling. Ruby looked to the window- then noticednsomething. It was a strand of bright orange hair hanging down. Alyxnwas listening. \"Um- Korbon my man?\"nHe started pointing to the wall. David looked back, then tappednCornelious on the shoulder. Cornelious slapped his hand away. Korbon took the priestnby the shoulders. \"I want my daughter back. Give her back to me.\"nHe said holding him against the wall. The colors started to drainnfrom the priest's face. Korbon bit his lip and placed a hand on hisnneck. \"I've lost my daughter and my wife now. I can get myndaughter back. Give her back to me or I will have to hurt you.\" Ruby watched as Alyxnstood up and walked into the hallway. Korbon looked and let go of thenpriest. Alyx was crying, the tears had made her eyes look red andnpuffy. She sniffed and held out her arms. \"I'm right here.\" Shensaid, her lip trembling. As Korbon looked at her he was reminded ofnLeloo and of all the times she had cried like that too.tt \"You wantnme back? Come and claim me. If you just want to fight then fight overnsomething else. I know I am not a real person. I know that I wasnpartially created like my mother. But I am not going to let you fightnover me.\" Korbon walked slowlyntowards his daughter. She looked up at him. He reached out andntouched her cheek with his hand. She was almost an exact replica ofnher mother. He then hugged her tightly. \"I thought I was looking atnyour mother.\" He said to her as he embraced her. \"Dad.\" She saidnstepping back. \"I can't go with you.\" She said quietly. \"Inwas getting ready to run away as it is.\" She whispered. \"I'vengot to go do what I was created to do. I've got to help stop evilnfrom growing.\" She walked to her room and grabbed a small bag. When she returned shenembraced her father again. \"I love you daddy.\" She said, then shenhugged Cornelious, David and finally Ruby. \"Good bye.\" Shensaid, and then she left. No one could ofnstopped her from leaving. No one could of kept her safe. She was justnlike her mother, she was a half-element, a perfect being. But what Alyx keptnforgetting was that with every story that there was a villain, andnshe was walking right to meet her's.[Chapter 3] Chapter Two Korbon andnRuby stood together on the roof of Ruby's apartment. They stood innsilence, Ruby not daring to say a word to Korbon. As they sat therenhe studied his friends face. Korbon had grown older, his hair was anlight shade of white and his face was full of deepening wrinkles. Hisnblue eyes looked crystal as he looked out over the city. \"Korbonnmy man? What are we gonna do?\" Rudy asked shakily, hoping that henwouldn't get another beating for speaking out of term, as wasncustomary for this friendship. Korbon looked to his friend, who wasndressed in a purple jumpsuit with matching hair and a flamboyant hat. \"She'snold enough to know what she wants or needs to do. I can't stopnher.\" He said slowly and boldly, but then exhaled sharply andnlooked down. \"But I can't loose my baby girl.\" He added sadly,nslowly looking up to his friend. \"Well,nuh, the priest kinda wants her too, but like man, he was way overnprotective.\" Rudy added pulling out a box of cigarettes, a habit hendecided might be beneficial after all. \"Cigarette?\" He offerednKorbon, who shook his head in disgust. \"So, what are we gonna do?\"nRudy asked lighting the death stick trapped between his lips. \"I'mngonna go to the Princess.\" Korbon said smiling and running off ofnthe roof and back into Rudy's apartment. Rudy stood there, taking andeep breath of his cigarette and then contemplating what Korbon justnsaid. \"Thenprincess…the princess…THE WHAT?\" He asked running off afternKorbon, who was running around the apartment grabbing the stuff henneeded to get on a ship. \"Korbon! Korbon!\" He shouted, gettingnhis attention. \"What?\"nKorbon asked opening a drawer and pulling out their passports and angun. Ever since Leeloo and Alyx left Korbon moved in with Rudy. Notnfor the company, but more for the nice place to live and thenamusement. \"We- nonhold up.\" Rudy said taking another breath of his cigarette. \"Wenare gonna go see the princess who hates us BOTH very much so we canngo get your daughter.\" He said. \"uhhhh…\"nKorbon said loading the gun. \"Yeah.\" \"Oh ok.nWe'll I get packing then.\" Rudy said shaking his head andntwitching as he walked, Korbon laughed as he watched him have hisnmini panic attack. \"Alyx?\" \"Jaron!\"nAlyx said embracing her friend. He then smiled at her and touched hernfire colored hair with a small smile on his face. She looked back upnat him. \"You look great!\" She said laughing. \"So donyou!\" He said happily, then leaned in and kissed her. \"I missnsneaking away with you.\" He said with a wink. Alyx blushed and thenntucked her hair back and into a ponytail. \"I missnthat too.\" She whispered devilishly. \"Cornelious still doesn'tnknow!\" She added with a laugh, then looked around cautiously. \"Letsnhurry and get on the plane before anyone finds out where I am.\" Jaronnlaughed. \"Still running from authority?\" \"Andnalways packin.\" She added with a smile, then they kissed again. \"I'mnglad you decided to go to my home world with me.\" He said. \"You'llnlove my mother, and my grandmother, the princess is the most amazingnwoman you'll ever meet. She'll adore you…as long as you don'tntell her your fathers name…\" \"Whatndid my father do to make her so angry?\" Alyx asked looking tonJaron. Jaronnpaused then looked to Alyx and quietly said. \"The diva, was mynaunt. And when she died about seventeen years ago, my mother blamednit on your father, even though he was the one that saved humanity.\"nHe said. \"She's very unforgiving towards hatred towards hernfamily.\" \"Oh.\"nAlyx said sadly, looking around and suddenly wishing her father wasnthere too. She remembered him, vaguely. And then after his appearancena short while ago she missed him more and more. \"Damn the priest.\"nShe said under her breath as they boarded the ship together, hopingnto never see earth again.

I hope you enjoy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- His hands shook as he stared down at the letter. The formal, printed 12 point font stared back at him. His vision blurred out most of the writing except for a single sentence. In frustration, he crumbled the paper into a ball; each crinkle seemed like a knife cutting into his heart. It couldn't be true, it…it was a lie. He tossed it over his shoulder, missing the garbage can, adding to the pile. He wiped his eyes and peered around the tiny kitchen. The sink over filled with dirty dishes and stains of left over food crusted along the white counters. He pushed the chair back, his hand pressed along his check as he tried to compose himself. Suddenly, a small cry broke through the silence. Daniel darted through the small hallway and slipped into the second bedroom. Flicking on the light, he cooed, \"Shh, shh it's okay. Daddy's here.\" The shrill cries subsided as the child was lifted in her fathers' arms. Brown curls slipped through the blanket, but those crisp sapphire eyes made it hard to breathe. The child snuggled against his chest, sleep drifting over her eyelids. Her small hands curled around his rough calloused hands with a firm grip. A small forced smile slid onto his face as he stared down at his little girl. Tears slid down his cheek and he felt his grip loosen. Placing her back down, he whispered, \"I guess it's just us….\" He brushed the small hairs away from her forehead, \"just us.\" He pulled his hand away, he left the room; the door slamming behind him, but the child did not stir. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Twenty - two year old, Allyson Miller scanned the \"job wanted\" section of the newspaper in frustration. She had been one of the smartest people in her class and she had to resort to newspaper jobs. Everything was so screwed up, but she wouldn't let that get her down; something was bound to turn up. Chatter surrounded her as the afternoon rush came flooding into the diner, but no one bothered her. Even the waitress seemed to be avoiding her as though Allyson carried the plague with her. Allyson rolled her eyes and tried to ignore them as much as they did to her. Licking her lips, she crossed out another job; everything seemed too elementary for her. \"Well that's why they're in the newspaper,\" Allyson muttered to herself for the fifteenth time. She glanced over at the clock and sighed, it was already half past twelve. A small gasp escaped her as she darted out of the restraint The late autumn breeze bit at her face as she hurried through the streets of New York City. Her faded green jacket pulled tightly around her for warmth, the broken zipper hitting against her leg rhythmically. People pushed and shoved each other; cars flew past through a second thought. Allyson stayed close to the buildings with less people to shove past her. Leaves crunched beneath her feet as she quickened her pace. Ducking into a small underground stairwell, she sighed deeply. Water seeped through the cracks; her sneakers soaked through on the bottom. A shiver ran down her spine, but she ignored it as she slid inside. The room was already filled with other young adults; music floating through the instrumental string instruments. \"Hey Ally, there you are?\" a high pitched voice called out. Allyson turned and spotted her best friend, Jane, walking towards her; her violin case tucked under her arm. \"Hey, how's it going?\" Allyson asked. She moved further into the room; her fingers itching to play something on her guitar. The small classroom of other adults eyed her wearily; even in the real world Allyson was separated from her peers. Jane walked with her, chattering away about her new boyfriend. Allyson resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Jane seemed to go through a new boyfriend every two months; never satisfied. \"So….do you have anyone?\" Jane asked, brushing her brown locks away from her face. Allyson shrugged. Hanging up her jacket, she said, \"I still haven't found him yet, Jane.\" \"Oh right, you're fairy tale prince. Come on Ally, get your head out of the clouds and start being realistic, I mean there is no prince Charming out there-\" \"Maybe not for you, but who knows he might be out there for me,\" Allyson said. Jane shoved her playfully and shook her head. Allyson was one of the smartest people she knew, but when it came to romance Allyson was a complete sap. The blond shook her head and picked up her guitar; her only comfort. \"So are you ready to work?\" she asked, flapping the composing sheet in Jane's face. Jane laughed and nodded. \"So where were we last time?\" \"The last measure was a minor cord,\" Allyson said, without even looking at the sheet. Her fingers brushed against the strings; the wood felt alive as the vibrations trailed up the neck. Jane pulled out her violin and began to play along side her friend. After two hours, Allyson pulled the guitar off her lap and laid it down on the ground. \"Okay, I think we're making progress,\" she penciled in the last note, \"it's starting to sound like something.\" Jane simply nodded. Music was more of a hobby for her, but to Allyson it was almost life itself. Tucking the instrument away, she asked, \"Did you ever think of becoming a composer, Al?\" Allyson shrugged, looking over the last few measures. \"Yeah, but there's no real money in that.\" \"Right, how's the job search going by the way?\" Jane asked. \"Not really going anywhere at the moment,\" Allyson admitted, biting at the eraser as her eyes scanned each note. \"Al….Ally….,\" Jane sighed and sat down next her friend. \"Allyson.\" Her hand pressed down the paper, covering the sections Allyson was working on. \"What?\" Allyson asked, irritated. \"You're doing it again. Being a perfectionist, it'll be fine. It already sounds good.\" \"It has to sound right, not just good,\" Allyson said, brushing the annoying hand away. Jane rolled her eyes. \"Look, what if I told you I know where to get a job.\" Allyson said snapped up; the pencil sliding back against the paper. The last note was messed up, but Allyson only stared at her friend. A job, it was what she had been waiting for and to finally have her parents off her case. \"What is it?\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I wanted this chapter to go on longer, but this seemed like a good place to stop.

But everything had changed two years ago. Two years that'snhow long it'd been since Danny left, two years since that horriblenfinale at the Magic Mansion, two years since my life had been alterednforever. I would never forget the last time I had seen Danny or ourngoody-bye. Flashback Allyson couldn'tnbelieve what had just happened, her friend Danny Sinclair had almostnbeen killed by the evil sorcerer named Max who was after Danny'snpowers. He had tricked Danny into wearing a ring that he told Dannynwould keep his powers in check, when in truth the ring put Danny'snpowers totally under Max's control. At the Grand Finale I wasnfinally able to convince Danny what Max was up to and he finally letnme take the ring off for him, after a 1000-pound weight had almostncrushed him since he couldn't remove the ring himself. He and Maxndueled and Danny had won…barely. He was able to get the ring ontonMax's finger but then Max had vanished into thin air. After it wasnall over Danny took off as fast as he could, when I couldn't findnhim backstage I assumed he was in his room so I took off to check. \" Danny? You innthere?\" I asked knocking on his door. \" Ya come on in,nit's unlocked.\" He said recognizing it was me. I opened the doornstepping into his room, he was hurriedly stuffing his things intonbags he didn't pause to look up at me. \" You ok?\" Inasked him \" Ya I'm fine.nWhy?\" He said while still packing. \" Wellneverything that happened was pretty freaky…\" I said \" Ya it wasnpretty scary.

I looked down atnthe floor unable to look at him any longer. \"Will I ever see younagain?\" I asked my voice choking up because of the tears nownrolling down my face. Danny came overnto me put his hand under my chin and raised my head up so we werenlooking into each other's eyes. \"Hey now don't cry please, Inwill keep in touch I promise.\" He said while wiping my tears away. I couldn't takenit anymore I threw my arms around him pulling him into a hug. To mynsurprise he didn't pull away, he held me close to him his handnstroking the back of my neck. I cried into his shoulder taking inneverything about him I didn't know when I'd see my only friendnagain. We stayed like that for a couple of minutes holding eachnother, him whispering soothing words into my ear. I never wanted itnto end but Danny pulled away. Suddenly a lightnbulb went off in my head. \"Let me come with you.\"' I said \" What are youncrazy? No way that'd be more dangerous then me telling you wherenI'm going. Besides you have a life to live, mine has already beennset for me, this is it.\" Danny exclaimed. I gave a strainednlaugh \"Ha What life?! I have no friends, my parents and I arenpractically strangers, I am just the know-all that no one likes. I'dnrather leave all that behind and go with you.\" Danny lookednfiercely into my eyes, it felt like he could read my soul when henlooked at me like that. \"Don't you ever say that you don't havena life to live for, you have a amazing future going for you as anreporter or whatever you decide to be and don't let those peoplenget to you they're just jealous that they don't have brains andnbeauty like you do.\" I blushed at hisnbrains and beauty comment. I looked sincerely back into his eyes.n\"Please let me go with you, let me help you.\" \" I'm sorrynAllyson this is something I have to do on my own. You're my onlynfriend I can't risk losing you I need to keep you safe. Please letnme do that. \" By the pain andnsadness I saw etched on his face and in his eyes I knew I couldn'tnkeep him from doing that, he had won I wasn't going. I closed myneyes as a single tear rolled down my face and I nodded. \"Ok\" Inwhispered. \" Thank you\"nhe said quietly. \"Oh and could you give this to my parents?\" henasked pulling a white envelope out of his bag. \"I wrote it just inncase something happened.\" \" Ya sure, ofncourse I will.\" I said taking the envelope from him. He slung his bagnover his shoulder \"I really should be going.\" He said \" Ok Goodbye, bensafe\". I said turning away to leave the room. I was almost to thendoor when I spun around. \"Danny wait!\" I exclaimed running up tonhim I had to give him one last hug. I threw myselfninto his arms and just held on to him. \"I'll miss you so much andnI won't ever forget you.\" I whispered. \" I will missnyou too, nor will I forget you. I'll keep in touch I swear.\" Hensaid restating his promise from earlier. He gently kissednmy forehead. \"Goodbye Allyson.\" The he was gone, vanished leavingnme standing there my forehead still tingling from his kiss there. EndnFlashback He had kept hisnpromise for about a year, he had called from disposable cell phones,nor pay phones sometimes he'd even write me a letter or email me.nBut that all stopped last year, it had been an entire year since Inhad heard from him and I feared the worst. Him leaving had changed menin many ways, I was no longer the bubbly, know it all that was inneverybody's face and in their business like I was when I met Danny.nI was now quiet and kept to myself as much as possible. I still hadnno friends and the relationship with my parents and I was as strainednas ever. I still loved to solve puzzles, but these days I kept it tonthose huge puzzle books and mystery movies. Theannouncernwalked up on stage as the performer finished, \"Ok we're going tontake a short intermission, then the lovely Allyson Miller is going tonsing for us.\" Oh great now I hadnto wait longer before I got to perform. The nerves were killing me! Indecided to go to the bathroom to freshen up. It was empty when I gotnin there so I freshened up my eye shadow a little bit and wondered ifnI was dressed up enough for performing. I was wearing a black tankntop with a red shirt over it so you saw both the red and black, andark blue mini skirt but not too short, and I pinned my curly hairnpart way up with a barrette of two red glittery flowers and I had onnblack heeled flip-flops. After I was done I assumed intermission wasnover so I headed back out. I was right theynwere just getting ready to announce me. \"Ok now that we've had anshort break please help me in welcoming the lovely Allyson Miller!\"nHe along with the audience clapped as I went up on stage there was anstool to sit if you wanted to and a microphone. The whole café wentndark except a huge spotlight shinning on me. Well it was now or nevernI thought as I approached the microphone. \"Hello everyone Inhope you're enjoying your evening, The song I am going to sing fornyou tonight was one I wrote for someone special to me that I didn'tnrealize how I felt for him until he was gone, it's called Goin'nCrazy.\" With that being said the house piano artist began and Inbegan to sing. Danny'snP.O.V. I couldn't believenmy timing I had stopped by the Blue Moon café a zillion times whennpassing through my old town and never saw anyone I knew here untilntonight. I had just walked in when they announced her they said hernname was Allyson Miller and I knew there were probably a ton ofnAllyson Millers out there, so I knew it couldn't be her. But fromnthe moment she had walked on stage I knew it was. I hadn't seen hernin 2 years but she was still as beautiful as ever especially undernthat spotlight, she looked like any angel and she was going to sing.nSo I kept back to the shadows and she began her song. Evernsince the day you went away and left me lonely and cold Mynlife just hasn't been the same ohh baby, nooo WhennI looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go Injust broke down. Babynif I ever get the chance to be with you again I would sacrifice 'causenthe feeling that I feel within Nonother man would ever make me feel so right It'snnice to smile when I get your phone call at night ButnI'd rather have you here with me, right next to me Inmiss the way you hold me tight. Ingotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch Innever thought that I could ever love a man so much Ingotta let you know I think that we are destiny Fornyou I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything That'snright baby I'm going crazy Inneed to be your lady I'venbeen thinking lately Thatnyou and me, yes we can make it Justnride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby Breaknit down now I'll tell you what I feel Fromnthe moment that I met you it's been so damn real Mynheart seems to skip another beat Everyntime we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak Tellnme that you really need me and you want me and you miss me Andnyou love me I'm your lady I'llnbe around waiting for you I'll put it down be the woman for you I'mnfalling so deep for you crazy over for you I`mncalling, calling out to you what am I going to do? It'sntrue, no fronting Itsnyou and no other I can no longer go on without you I'llnjust break down. Ingotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch Innever thought that I could ever love a man so much Ingotta let you know I think that we are destiny Fornyou I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything That'snright baby I'm going crazy Inneed to be your lady I'venbeen thinking lately Thatnyou and me, yes we can make it Justnride with me, roll with me I'm in love with you baby Ohhh,nohhh.... Crazy...nlady..... lately.... Ohhhnohhh..... Ohhnohhh ohhhhhh Baby... AsnAllyson finished the audience gave her a huge round of applause. Incouldn't believe it, her voice was amazing! I never knew she couldnsing like that and that song…she had said she wrote for someonenspecial that she didn't know how she felt until he was gone..Itncouldn't be me no way. Allyson had to have found someone else andnmoved on by now. All the same I knew that I had to play the song Inhad wrote for her when I was in hiding and with my luck I had broughtnmy guitar along with me. Careful to not let Allyson see me yet I madenmy way up to the front to talk to the announcer. \"Excusenme sir?\" I asked tapping him on the back. \"Yesnhow can I help you young man?\" The announcer said turning around. \"CannI sign up to play a song?\" \"Wellnyou are in luck Allyson was our last scheduled performer, but we haventime for one more. Follow me!\" The announcer exclaimed motioning mento follow him. Henwent up on stage, \"Ladies and Gentlemen stay in your seats! We havenone last performer so I need your help in welcoming the amazing……\"n He trailed off he had failed to ask my name before going up onnstage. \"CodynMontgomery.\" I finished for him stepping onto the stage with mynguitar. The announcer stepped off as I pulled out my guitar. Allyson'snP.O.V. Inwas almost to the door when I heard The announcer say there was anlast minute performer I turned to see who it was, I hadn't seen himnbefore so I took a seat near the back and decided to see how he was.nHe looked like the bad-boy rebel type. He had on jeans that had holesnin the knees and what looked like a red old No Fear shirt with anblack leather jacket and old Vans. He also had hair that was spikednup and red streaks in them. He had on a big pair of sunglasses thatnhe had yet to take off, I wondered if he was going to play with themnon. Danny'snP.O.V. \"Helloneveryone, I have been here often but never played at open mike untilntonight. The song I have chosen to play for you is a special song tonme. I wrote it for a very close friend of mine who I realized she wasnmore than a friend to me, but was too scared to tell her. She didn'tnlike that she was different and didn't fit in, but I thought thatnwas made her beautiful.\" Allyson'snP.O.V. ThenCody guy finally took off his glasses and his eyes were so similar tonDanny's it made me want to cry. Now that I thought about it henlooked very similar to Danny maybe it was him….No it wasn't itncouldn't be. I was just thinking it was because I had just sang mynsong I wrote to him and was thinking about him. I snapped back tonattention as I heard him softly strumming his guitar he wasnbeginning. Danny'snP.O.V. Inwas so glad my guitar was tuned. I scanned the crowd for Allyson andnI was so relived to see that was she was still there towards thenback. So I began to play and sing her song. Youndon't run with the crowd Youngo your own way Youndon't play after dark You light up my day Gotnyour own kind of style Thatnsets you apart Baby,nthat's why you captured my heart, Inknow sometimes you feel like you don't fit in Andnthis world doesn't know what you have within WhennI look at you, I see something rare Anrose that can grow anywhere. Andnthere's no one I know that can compare Whatnmakes you different, makes you beautiful. What'snthere inside you shines through to me Innyour eyes I see, all the love I'll ever need You'renall I need, oh girl Whatnmakes you different, makes you beautiful to me Hey,nyeah yeah yeah Youngot something so real Yountouched me so deep Seenmaterial things Don'tnmatter to me Soncome as you are You'vengot nothing to prove Younwon me with all that you do AndnI wanna take this chance to say to you Whatnmakes you different, makes you beautiful. What'snthere inside you, shines through to me Innyour eyes I see, all the love I'll ever need You'renall I need, oh girl Whatnmakes you different, makes you beautiful Youndon't know how you touched my life. Ohnin so many ways I just can't describe Yountaught me what love is supposed to be Younsaw the little things that make you beautiful to me Ohnyeah, yeah Whatnmakes you, Whatnmakes you different, makes you beautiful What'snthere inside you, shines through to me Innyour eyes I see, all the love I'll ever need You'renall I need, oh girl Whatnmakes you different, makes you beautiful to me Everythingnyou do is beautiful Lovenyou give shinesnright through me Everythingnyou do is beautiful Oh,nyou're beautiful to me Itnfelt so good to finally have been able to sing that song to Allyson,nI had been wanting to do that for a long time. The crowd was stillnclapping after it died down for a minute I shouted a thank you thennbegan packing up my guitar. Allyson'snP.O.V. Incouldn't believe what I had just heard, that was the most beautifulnsong I had ever heard. That voice was amazing and at the same time sonfamiliar. \"Getna grip girl, it is not Danny!\" Inhad to get out of there so I made a quick escape and ran to my carnand drove off. Danny'snP.O.V. I had finallyngotten my guitar packed up and was making my way to the back wherenAllyson had sat but she wasn't there. I began to search the entirencafé with no luck. I couldn't believe it she was gone, I was sonclose to seeing her again and she was gone! \"You should'ventalked to her before you went on stage dumbo, she's not going tonwait for you if she doesn't know you!\" He scolded himself. So bummed out thatnhe had screwed up his chance with her, left and went to findnsomewhere to stay for the night. Allyson'snP.O.V. I ended up at anpark, why I don't know but it sounded like such a great idea. So Ingot out of the car and went and lay in the soft green grass gazing upnat the stars, thinking of everything that had happened tonight and ofncourse Danny. After a while of laying there I saw a shooting starnshoot across the night sky, I decided to wish on it. \"I wish Dannynwas here.\" I whispered. Danny'snP.O.V. I couldn't believenmy luck, fate really wanted to bring us together tonight! She wasnlaying only a few feet away from me. I had checked into my hotel andnafter seeing Allyson I wanted to be Danny again for one night afternbeing Cody for two years now. So I took a shower washing the red outnof my hair and styling back to what it used to look like and puttingnon some of my old clothes I kept from my trip to the mansion. I alsonput on my slivier necklace that I used to wear everyday but took offnonce I had gone into hiding. I then decided to go for a walk andnended up at this park and so had Allyson because there she was andnwhat I heard her say made my heart skip a beat. She has seen anshooting star and wished that I was there. \"She hasn'tnforgotten me…\"I thought amazed. I wasn't going tonscrew this chance up like I did the last one, so I started walkingntowards her. General P.O.V. \"I wish Danny wasnhere.\" Allyson whispered wishing on a shooting star. \"And so you havenwished it so it will be granted.\" I heard a voice say. She sat up andnturned around. \"Who's there?\" She asked. \"It's me.\"nSaid the voice, the voice that Allyson thought she'd never hearnagain. \"Danny?\" shensaid quietly as she saw the person approaching. Danny had reachednher. \"Yes Allyson it's me.\" She sprang up \"No,nNo it's not you! I'm dreaming or something you're dead, youndied a year ago!\" she exclaimed backing away before falling on thenground crying. Danny ran up to hernand cradled her. \"No Allyson I'm alive I'm right here withnyou.\" She cried into hisnshirt for a few minutes before looking up at him. \"It really isnyou.\" She said He chuckled anlittle. \"Yes it's me, it's really me.\" \"I thought younwere dead.\" She said softly looking at the ground. He stood up andnhelped her up. \"Now why would you think that?\" he asked. \"Well you stoppedncalling, writing, everything so I just thought Max had found you.\" \"He has found me ancouple of times but I've been able to hold him off for now. Mynmagic is getting stronger and more controlled. I will be able tondefeat him one day, I know it.\" \"I've missed younso much Danny.\" She said looking into his eyes her own shinningnwith tears. He came up to hernand pulled her into his arms. \"Oh Ally you don't know how muchnI've missed you and I'm sorry I broke my promise to keep inncontact with you, but I thought you were better off me, that you hadnfound another friend and it looks like you did by the song you sangntonight at the Blue Moon.\" \"Better offnwithout you?!\" Allyson exclaimed pulling out of his embracement.n\"Danny when are you going to get it?! I have no one else you'renit the only one! Wait a minute..How did you know I sang tonight atnthe Blue Moon?\" She asked \"Because I heardnyou.\" He said \"Y-You heard me?\"nHow?\" Allyson asked astonished. \"I go therensometimes to get food when I'm passing through here and I managednto walk in just as they were announcing you so I listened to yournsong. So who's the lucky guy your wrote that song for?\" He askedndreading the answer. Allyson looked up atnhim smiling. \"You.\" She whispered. \"Once you left I realized Inhad feelings for you, feelings you don't have for your friends. Indidn't tell you all those times we talked because one, I was toonscared and two because I knew you didn't feel the same way.\" Shensaid sadly Danny approached hernand lifted her chin up so she was looking at him instead of thenground. \"But that's where you're wrong Ally, I do feel the samenway, didn't you hear my song I played for you after you were donensinging?\" \"You were Cody?\" He nodded \"Yepnthat was me. I wrote that song for you after I broke contact withnyou. I had to get my feelings for you out somehow and when I saw yountonight I knew I had to play it for you.\" Allyson couldn'tnbelieve it..that song the most beautiful song she'd ever heard wasnDanny's song to her… \"That has to benthe most beautiful, most amazing thing anyone has ever done to me.\"nShe said now looking him the eyes smiling. \"I'm glad younliked it.\" He whispered now leaning closer and closer to her. Allyson could feelnher heart beating a minute, it was going so fast she was surprisednDanny couldn't hear it and her butterflies in her stomach werengetting faster and faster. \"I can't believe it he's going tonkiss me.\" She thought excitedly as she leaned in to meet him. The moment theirnlips met they both felt fireworks go off like never before, this wasnright, this was how it was meant to be The two of them together. Thenkiss was gentle but also held all the love each had be feeling forneach other for the last two years. At last they broke apart in neednof oxygen. \"I love younAllyson Miller.\" Danny said leaning his forehead against hers. \"You don't knownhow much I love you Danny Sinclair.\" She said looking into hisnbeautiful brown eyes, not believing this was happening, she hadn'tnfelt this happy in a long time ever since Danny had left. Danny saw it to,nwhen he had first seen her at the park and even on stage he had seennhow broken she had looked, her green eyes used to shine like emeraldsnsparkling with happiness and curiosity. But when he'd seen her, herneyes were a dull like the light had gone out and she just looked likenshe was going through the motions but not living them, she was justnthere. It made him feel horrible knowing he was the cause of it. So after a littlenbit they decided to just lay in the grass enjoying being with onenanother. They ended up leaning up against a tree Danny against thentree and Allyson against him, her head on his chest, his arms aroundnher waist and their fingers intertwined together. After a few momentsnof silence Danny looked down at Allyson. \"Are you sure you wantnthis, want me?\" She leaned her headnon him and looked up to meet his eyes. \"Of course Danny you'renall I've ever wanted. Why would you ask such a question?\" \"Well I don'tnknow of any girls that would want a boyfriend that can't take themnout on dates or even be with them really except a few times a year ifnhe's lucky.\" \"There's a waynto fix that…\" Allyson trailed off her eyes sparkling. Danny loved the waynshe looked right now, she looked like a beautiful teenage girl in hernskirt and all but in her eyes he saw the happiness and curiosity of anlittle girl. He loved it. \"And how'snthat?\" Danny asked her giving her a warm smile. \"By letting me gonwith you.\" Allyson answered still smiling. Danny's smilenquickly faded. \"Ally I'm sorry but I gave you an answer two yearsnago and it still hasn't especially now that you mean more to menthan ever.\" Allyson sighed andngot up and walked a few feet away from Danny. \"But we're finallyntogether again I don't know if I can risk losing you again, I don'tnknow if I'll survive it this time. I'm not a little girl anymorenDanny I can handle myself.\" She said with her back to him. Danny got up walkednover to her and wrapped his arms around her from behind. \"I'm notntrying to treat you like a little girl Allyson, you are a maturenyoung woman but I'm not talking about you being able to handlenyourself, I'm talking about me. You don't know how scared I wasnwhen I thought Max had stabbed you with those swords at the finale,nmy heart stopped beating, and I'll never forget the look ofnsatisfaction in Max's eyes as he did it. I couldn't handle younbeing with me because I'd have to face everyday with you as if itnwas my last day with you and the danger I could put in isnindescribable.\" Allyson turned tonface him. \"I really mean that much to you?\" She asked. Danny looked at hernstraight in the eyes. \"Ally, I love you more than anything on thisnearth, I would give my life for you and I won't let you give yoursnfor me. Being around you is like magic, I wish I could spend everydaynwith you and one day once this is all over we will and that's anpromise.\" \"I-just I don'tnknow if I can handle losing you again like that last year, it was thenworst year ever.\" \"I know and that'snmy fault I shouldn't have broken contact with you, I promise thatnwon't ever happen again.\" \"You mean it?\"nshe asked him tears coming to her eyes yet again. \"With all mynheart.\" He said smiling at her, then he kissed her sealing hisnnewfound promise her. Once they hadnbroken, he looked her, \"I need to get going, I have to get an earlynstart in the morning.\" Allyson had beenndreading the moment when he'd say this. \"You want to stay mynhouse?\" she asked him hopeful that he's say yes. \"I'm sorry Allynbut I need to get some sleep and I know if I was to stay with you wenwouldn't get any, so I'll just go back to my hotel.\" She nodded \"Ok Inunderstand.\" When Danny looked her he saw the emptiness return tonher eyes and she became quiet again. This was breaking his heartnseeing her like this. \"Ally Please don'tndo this…\" he begged. \"Do what?\" shenasked looking at him with sad eyes. \"Look so broken..Incan't stand it.\" \"I'm sorrynDanny..it's just you're the only bright spot in my life anymore.nI have no friends..I get teased and picked on at school, I don'tneven know my parents… nothing seems to go right anymore! My lifenjust basically sucks…I feel so hurt all the time for no reason..Indon't see any reason to go on…..\" She said now starting to crynonce more. \"Oh Ally\" hensaid drawing her into him like he had done so many times. \"I'm sonsorry I wish I could take it all away, I really do.\" he tightenednhis grip on her as if he could block out all the evil in her life. She started sobbingnhard and shaking so still hold her tight Danny lowered the two ofnthem to the ground so she was basically curled up on his lap and henwas holding her tight. After Allyson had calmed down a little bit shenfinally spoke. \"You do Danny, youndo just by being her with me.\" She sobbed into his shirt. Please promise menthat you will still go on, no matter how hopeless it seems because Incan't live with out you Allyson I really can't.\" She nodded her facenstill buried in his shirt He pulled her backnand looked into her tear stained face. \"We will be together again Inpromise and I'll keep in touch and hopefully I can see you againnsoon.\" Allyson smilednsuddenly feeling so much stronger just by looking into his eyes \"OknI can do this, as long as you're in my life Danny, I can handlenit.\" \"There's myngirl.\" Danny said smiling \"Oh before I go I have something fornyou. And he reached into his pocket and pulled something out. \"SorrynI could wrap it or anything but here\" He said handing it Allyson. \"Oh Danny it'snbeautiful!\" Allyson exclaimed when she saw it. It was a sterlingnsliver locket in the shape of a heart with a diamond star on thenfront and inside was a picture of them taken at the mansion. Theynwere outside on and he was behind her with his arms around her chest,nher hands on top of his and his head resting on her shoulder. \"Wenboth looked so happy then..\" Allyson thought seeing their twonsmiling faces and eyes shinning. \"Put it on me please.\" Shenasked Danny He slipped it on hernneck. \"Perfect .\" he said when he saw it on her. \"Thank you so muchnDanny.\" Allyson said \"You're verynwelcome.\" Danny smiled. \"Remember the magic is in here.\" Hensaid touching the spot where her heart was. \"As long as younbelieve, I will always be with you.\" \"I believe, I do.\"nAllyson whispered. \"Keep up with thensinging you were amazing.\" He complemented her. \"I will.\"nAllyson smiled. She reached up to hug him \"I'm really going tonmiss you.\" She said. \"I'll miss yountoo.\" He said and kissed her longingly and tenderly one last time. \"I love you.\" Henwhispered into her ear. \"I love you too..\"nshe responded. Then just like thenlast time, He vanished without warning. But this time Allyson knewnthings were going to be ok, they'd be together again someday andnuntil that day cam she'd carry him in her heart always. \"I'll alwaysnbelieve.\" she said up to the night sky clutching the locket Dannyngave her.

The avenue was shaded in some parts by leafy palm trees, but he could feel the heat of late August scorching the back of his neck. Why does school have to start this early in the year anyway? Danny complained to himself. Summer just wasn't a long enough break. He'd rather be back at home sleeping in, and then go explore the mangrove swamps and reefs later on in the day. Danny had always hated school. It wasn't the classes or the homework that he hated, in fact that was the only part he liked, but it was the other kids that made him uncomfortable. Danny had never fit in, and he had always felt as if he was the biggest freak in the school. No one could relate to him, he was just the school weirdo. Summer was the only time when he could actually get away from it all to be by himself. It had started ever since kindergarten. At the school talent show, all the other kids had sung, danced, or played a musical instrument. Not Danny. He was the nerd who did magic tricks for everyone. In 1st grade, in the play, everyone else had gotten leading roles in the cast, except for Danny, who worked back stage with the tech stuff. Ever since Elementary School he had been the different weird kid. But Danny's thoughts were interrupted when he walked past Pensacola's local skate shop: Urban Sk8 Florida. It was Danny's favorite place to go. I've got a little time before school, Danny thought. I could go in and check things out for just a little bit. \"Hello Danny,\" said the shopkeeper. Danny was a regular costumer at the shop, because in addition to his fascination in magic, he enjoyed biking, roller skating, and skateboarding. \"I've gotten a new shipment. You can check it out for a little but I'll have to kick you out in a little since school will be starting soon for you.\" \"Uh, thanks,\" Danny replied. \"I'll probably come back after school.\" That's when a cool new skateboard over on display in the shop window caught his eye. On the bottom side of the board, was a black and orange image of a Chinese dragon. \"Wow, how much is that one?\" Danny asked, with great interest. \"Seventy-five dollars,\" the shopkeeper answered flatly. \"Damn it,\" Danny muttered under his breath. \"Excuse me?\" said the shopkeeper. \"Uh…I mean darn it,\" Danny corrected himself quickly. \"Uh, I gotta go, so I'll see you this afternoon. Bye!\" If only I had enough money to buy that thing, Danny thought. It was the coolest skateboard he had ever seen, and the one he currently owned was falling apart anyway. Suddenly, without warning, Danny felt something beneath his feet, and realized that he was starting to slide down the pavement. Looking down, he was astounded to see a skateboard under his feet. Looking back into the shop window, the Dragon skateboard was gone. How could this be? What the frick was happening? Hopping off the skateboard, Danny flipped it over to see it's underside. Sure enough, there was the orange and black image of the dragon. How could it just have appeared like that under my feet? Danny nervously glanced over at the shop. The shopkeeper was still at his desk, helping another customer as if nothing had even happened. Had anyone else noticed? Danny didn't want to be accused of stealing. A criminal record was the last thing he wanted right now. But I have the skateboard now. YES!!! This rocks! Quickly, Danny looked back again at the shop to make sure that no one noticed the missing skateboard. It's not technically stealing, Danny told himself. And without another thought about it, he skated away down the street. This is so great, Danny thought, excited. I feels like I'm flying. He grinded down benches, across staircases, and on the rails. The new skateboard felt perfect under his feet. It was almost like…magic. But as Danny rode towards the school, his reverie was interrupted when a large brown object flying at him hit him in the side of the head. He was completely tossed off the board, and fell onto the hard pavement, scraping his elbow so that it bled. Looking at the object that had hit him, he saw that it was a football. That could only mean one thing. Turning around, Danny saw Terrance Dorrance, the meanest kid in the school. He lived to watch kids bleed and suffer. In fact, Danny was surprised to know that no one had died under his wrath yet. Not yet, but they will, Danny knew. Please not me. \"Waz up, Sinclair?\" Terrance asked in a mock voice. \"I see you have a new skateboard. Pretty cool, huh? What would you do if I did this?\" Without warning, Terrance grabbed the skateboard, and with his bare hands, cracked it in half! \"What are you going to do about that?\" he asked, in a cruel voice. Danny just glared up at Terrance. There was no way he could fight this kid, he was so strong that he could crush a person's head like a grapefruit. He just gave him the nastiest look he could muster. \"I hope you rot in hell,\" Danny muttered under his breath, glaring at the mean kid. \"What's that you said?\" Terrance asked, chuckling. \"I don't plan on going to hell anytime soon, but I can arrange a one way ticket for you there right now!\" With that, Terrance seized Danny's throat in his large vice like hands, and began to squeeze, choking him. \"Stop! Please somebody! Help me!\" Danny tried to shout out, but all that came out of his strangled voice were a few muffled grunts. Terrance was killing him! Danny could do nothing, as the edges of his peripheral vision began to fade, becoming dark shadows. He began to lose consciousness as the darkness surrounded him and the sound of Terrance's taunting voice began to fade away. It was a nightmare come true! I wish he would just leave me alone, Danny thought in desperation. I wish he would just go away! I'm too young to die. And that's when the strangling stopped. Danny didn't even know what had happened. Terrance was gone! Where could he have gone? Something damn strange was going on here. For a few minutes Danny just sat there in the street. Blood was oozing onto the asphalt from a place where the vain had popped and cut open in his neck. Terrance had done some serious damage to him! But he was alive! Danny reveled in the thought. He had been positive that he would never live to tell this story. But what had happened? That was the strange part. The piece of the puzzle that just didn't fit. Why was Terrance gone? Danny was more than happy that he was, but it seemed strange. He hadn't even seen him run away, or loosen his grip. He had just vanished into thin air. Danny glanced over at the skateboard, a few feet away. It lay where Terrance had left it, broken in half on the sidewalk. That didn't make sense either, how the skateboard had just appeared under his feet. Something supernatural seemed to be going on here, maybe even…magic? Danny brushed the thought away, magic wasn't real, and everyone knew it. It was just some strange phenomenon, that's all. His strength slowly coming back to him, Danny got up and grabbed his backpack, glancing at the broken skateboard. Sighing, he picked up the two broken halves and tossed them in to the garbage can on the corner of the block. Then, he resumed his journey to school. He was already late, he knew it, but after a life and death situation such as the one that had happened this morning, being tardy was the least of his worries. Walking into the schoolyard, of Pensacola High School, he noticed that a large group of students were all gathered around a tall oak tree, and looking up. What are they looking at? Danny wondered. That's when he saw who was in the tree. Terrance! He was hanging from a high branch, by only a belt loop! Terrance was flailing his arms and legs around, in an unsuccessful effort to free himself. Danny had never seen him in this type of situation. It was rather amusing. All the other kids seemed to think so too, because they were pointing and laughing. Terrance picked on a lot of kids at school, so for them and Danny, this was almost like payback. When Terrance caught sight of Danny, his eyes bulged out of their sockets, in what was that? Fear? Yes! It was fear in Terrance's eyes. He seemed to think that this was Danny's doing. Was it? \"You…Sinclair,\" he shouted from the tree, pointing fearfully at Danny. \"You're…you're a… a sorcerer! You put me up here! You're a…a…demon!\" \"Right back at you,\" Danny shouted back. \"You just tried to choke me to death.\" \"This isn't over, Sinclair,\" Terrance shouted, but with anxiousness in his voice. \"You're a wizard! Black magic!\" \"I am not,\" Danny shouted back. \"You've gone crazy. How could I have done that to you?\" Still, in the back of his mind, Danny couldn't help but wonder if Terrance was right. Could he really be a wizard? No, that was impossible. But again, several \"impossible\" things had happened this morning. What did it all mean? It was the beginning of the end of the \"normal\" Danny Sinclair. \"Danny, I know all about you,\" said Max, years later in a hidden room in the Magic Mansion. \"I know about you're powers, and you're struggles.\" \"But aren't you the one who said I was faking to get attention?\" Danny asked. \"Aren't you the president of the World Wide Skeptics Society?\" \"A perfect cover, don't you think? You see, every few generations a few truly powerful sorcerers are born with powers that would boggle the imaginations of ordinary men. I'm one of those sorcerers. And Danny, so are you.\" \"But if I'm so great and powerful, then how come my powers are always totally out of check?\" \"Well, you're young yet, you've got a lot to learn. But we'll work on it. We'll work on it together. Now, I want to show you something.\" Max pulled out the two miniature knights and the two began to battle each other, wit against wit. Despite the tragedy that was about to, Danny understood himself a little better than before. And for now, that was all that mattered.

How…why'd you bring me here!? Where I am?\" Max chuckled to himself. The signature chuckle of complete evil and creepiness. \"Do you not know that I'm the most powerful sorcerer in the world? True, you have more potential than I ever will, but you haven't obtained it yet. And so I have a proposition to make with you.\" \"What are you saying?\" Danny asked suspiciously. \"I promise to teach you how to master your powers if you in turn promise to join me.\" \"You ALREADY MADE that promise Max, remember!? You told me that you were going to help me with my powers, and what did you do? You tried to take them away from me with that stupid ring and almost dropped a thousand pound lead weight on me.\" Max chuckled again. \"You don't understand Danny.\" \"Oh, I understand all right. I understand perfectly well. You still want my powers. You're trying to do the same thing all over again. All you care about is power.\" \"I have to say Danny, you flatter me, and you're on the right track. I do love power. But you're wrong about me wanting your powers. You can keep those. As a matter of fact this is why I need you. You're probably one of the only other sorcerers of your generation, and together we can do unimaginable things if we do it together. What do you say? Join me? I promise to teach you everything you'll ever need to know.\" \"Again with the promises. Why should I trust you. You tried to kill me. And not just me. Alyson too.\" \"Oh nonsense. I never intended to lay a hand on her. She was simply in the way and I had to get rid of her to get what I wanted. And it obviously didn't work did it? or you'd be dead and I'd have your powers and wouldn't be talking to you right now.\" \"Why do you want me. Tell the truth.\" \"Danny, I think you know the truth. Think about it. I was going to steal your powers and take over the world. That sounds extreme, but when you're a sorcerer you do all sorts of extreme things. But what would have happened when I died? There would be no heir to inherit my power. I have no children. You're the only person I have. And you are a sorcerer like me. We'd rule together and when I died, I'd transfer my remaining powers to you. It's brilliant.\" \"No, it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.\" \"All I'm asking for is that you think about it Danny. I understand that you have anger towards me after what I did to you, and you have the right to feel that way, but I'm truly sorry for what I did. This is our chance to make amends and stop the fighting. We can be like a father and son.\" \"I already HAVE a father,\" Danny replied. \"And a mother. And they're very good parents.\" \"Yes Danny, but they're mortals. They will never completely understand you the way I do. And what can you learn about your powers from them anyway? Nothing.\" \"What about Alyson?\" \"Alyson? My dear boy, are you joking? Do you really expect me to answer that? Alyson's just a girl. You'll meet plenty of other girls when the time is right. Don't worry about silly little romances with people like Alyson. She knows too much.\" \"Don't talk about Alyson that way. I love her. And she's not just 'some girl.' She's the only person who truly understands me. Not even you understand me. All you know about me is that I'm a sorcerer, nothing more. You don't even care about me.\" \"That's not true.\" \"Shut up.\" \"Look Danny. I think what's best is if you think about it a little. Being evil isn't as bad as everyone says.\" \"Do you hear yourself?\" But Max just snapped his fingers and suddenly everything disappeared. Danny awoke…back in his room in his house in Pensacola, Florida. He guessed that Max had teleported him back to the Magic Mansion in New Orleans. Wow, that was weird. \"Danny, what's wrong,\" his father asked at the dinner table that night. \"You seem…distracted?\" \"Is something going on at school?\" his mother asked. \"You don't look well.\" \"Hmm….what?\" Danny answered. \"Oh…sorry. I'm fine. I just have a lot on my mind right now.\" Danny's father raised his eyebrows. \"About what? Is this about you and Alyson? Has anything…been going on between you two lately?\" \"What do you mean, has something been going on between us lately? No. Everything is fine. Stop worrying.\" With that, Danny stormed out of the kitchen and outside to the backyard. He sighed as he sat in the swing. He couldn't believe it. Max actually wanted to make peace with him. There would be no more hiding, no more secrets, no more battling a physco maniac. Should he do it? Should he join the \"dark side.\" Lots of people were evil and they seemed ok with it, like Hades from Hercules, and Jafar from Aladdin. Why am I comparing my life to Disney all of the sudden? he wondered. \"Hey Danny!\" Danny almost jumped out of his skin. The sudden voice that had broken his thoughts was like lighting a match to a fuse bomb. It took him a few moments to realize that it was just Alyson. \"Hey…hey Alyson,\" Danny stuttered embarrassed. \"Something wrong?\" Alyson asked. \"You totally freaked out just now.\" \"No, it's just…I've got some strange news.\" \"Ok, shoot.\" \"I talked to Max today.\" \"What? What do you mean you talked to Max?\" \"I don't know. It was really weird. All I remember was that he somehow teleported me back to the Magic Mansion and told me that if I joined him and his evil schemes, he would leave me and my powers alone and there would be peace between us.\" \"He wants you to become evil like him?\" \"Guess so.\" \"Well, what are you going to do?\" Alyson asked. \"Oh come on Alyson, you know the answer to that.\" \"No, actually I don't. I'm just hoping that you choose the right one. And I know you know what is right. I'm just not sure you're going to do what's right.\" \"Why wouldn't I do what's right? Don't I always do what's right?\" \"Yah, but this is a tough decision. Max is practically offering you freedom from his wrath, and we all know that that would be really nice. It's just too bad that it comes at such a harsh price.\" \"Alyson, listen to me. I've thought it over. Actually, I haven't, but you just made me decide right here and now. I'm not going to go along with it. We're just going to have to find a way to defeat Max, because that's the only way we'll be free of him.\" Alyson grabbed Danny's hand. She squeezed it comfortingly. \"That's the Danny I know and love.\" Danny smiled. It was comforting to have someone like Alyson on his side, but it didn't prevent him from feeling the fear of how Max was going to react to it all. \"Have you decided, Danny, my boy,\" Max asked. \"Don't call me that. I'm not you're boy. And I never will be…because I'm not joining you, so suck it up.\" Max's calm face suddenly boiled over in red hot rage. \"WHAT! I MADE YOU AN OFFER YOU COULDN'T REFUSE!!! YOU'RE FREEDOM FROM ME!!! THIS IS NOT OVER DANNY! NOT EVEN CLOSE!!! YOU BETTER SLEEP WITH A GUN AT NIGHT BECAUSE I'M NOT RESTING UNTIL YOU AND ALYSON ARE DEAD!!!\" Time to get out of here, Danny thought. Quickly brainstorming a quick spell from a book he had read in the Magic Mansion's library, Danny disappeared and teleported back to good old Pensacola. The End Hope you enjoyed. I know this is a short story, but there's not much else to say about it. We all know that Danny would never truly go evil, ever. And if he ever DID have a phsycotic breakdown, he'd have Alyson to keep him in check. Thanks for reading and please review.

I own nothing, but the plot. I hope you enjoy. -- The music faded away as the priest began to speak. Allyson Miller's breath caught in her throat; her deep green eyes locked with deep blue orbs she knew all to well. After five years, she couldn't believe it was possible for her to be here with him. Their fingers were intertwined together and nothing could tare them apart. \"I love you,\" Allyson whispered mentally. A large smile spread over her lover's face reserving the message. Danny Sinclairs' fingers intertwined themselves to a perfect fit with his love. For a moment, he glanced off into the crowd; it was hardly a typical number of people for a special event such as their wedding; yet even with only those two rows that were their neither him or Allyson would've changed it at all. Allyson noticed and followed his gaze and smiled at her parents. Caught up in the moment, Danny almost missed the priest asking for the vows. \"What?\" he asked confused; his attention drawn back to the priest. A small rumble of laughter erupted behind him, but he ignored them. It was time for the special vows; vows of love, protection, and friendship that he had never announced to her before. He felt her squeeze his hand for reassurance his gaze drifting down until they were locked once more. Clearing his throat, he began, \"when you found me I-\" They shot down the floor as shocked and terrified gasps filled the church as the massive stain glass window above the alter shattered around the couple. Instantly, Danny covered Allyson as the shards of glass aimed and struck his back tarring his tux to shreds. Through the chaos, he pulled Allyson tighter to his chest; but large slices of her veil ripped off; her golden curls darkened from the intense heat. Behind them, a door slammed the priest fleeing the scene while more screams erupted from the crowds. \"Get up!\" a hollow voice bellowed from the entrance. Heads snapped around at the clearly uninvited guest. He was wearing all black; which in the heat was amazing; he was bald except for a few white hairs on his head and his ruff beard. His dark gaze fixed on the young couple. \"Get up!\" he commended again. Gradually, the two lovers rose to their feet their fingers still locked together as they faced him. \"You can't hurt us, Max; we're together and not even-\" A chuckle escaped Max's lips as he moved closer shaking his head. \"No, Danny boy, you're not together,\" he half gestured to the bare fingers, \"no rings.\" Suddenly, the rings flew over him and landed on the carpet in metal ashes. \"Now let's get this over-\" Danny cut him off with a wave of his hand sending Max flying back into the stone wall. Terrified shrieks filled the church again and Allyson caught sight of their parents' faces. Fear, terror, confusion mixed together as they ran out of the church not looking back once. A pang of guilt and slight confusion swept through her heart, but the next second a fire ball was lunged at her as she ducked away. Neither Danny nor Max seemed to notice the swarm of people leaving both on defensive and attack positions. Soon the church was filled with smoke and ash as fire, energy, and shields sprang up between the three of them as the building crumpled and fall apart around them. \"You have enough power, leave-\" Allyson screamed over the blaze, but she stumbled back as a wave of wind swept towards her. However, Danny held up; their fingertips touching with both urgently and from pure love. Yet, it gave Max the opportunity he needed. Another gust of wind separated them as Allyson's finger slipped from her lovers' grasp; blood slipped down her arms as she slammed back against one of the few walls still standing. \"Ahhhh!\" she screamed fallback down to her hands and knees. Danny gasped, but let out a sudden yell of pain grabbing his shoulder. Max only laughed. \"Now, let's finish what I started five years ago.\" From the corner of his eye, Danny saw Allyson crawling over towards him and she was loosing blood fast. Falling down to his knees, he reached out for her hand. \"We can do this,\" she told him telepathically; a small wince escaping from her lips as his hand clasped over hers. Max laughed and stepped closer of the ruble. \"You honestly think you can beat me?\" Neither Allyson nor Danny replied as they inched closer; their lips centimeters apart before passionately kissing each other. A storm of fire balls flew at them, but never touched the young lovers. The kiss deepened and the fire balls reversed their course and flew back at Max, burning him alive. After a few seconds, they pulled apart and smiled at each other. \"You did it, Danny,\" Allyson whispered, her hot breath tickling his face. Danny shook his head and brought her into a sitting position; their fingers once more intertwined. \"No, we did it, Allyson.\" His fingers slid through her golden curls and kissed her softly. Suddenly, Allyson pulled away and turned away from him. \"You never told them did you?\" \"What?\" \"You never told anyone about your powers, besides me I mean?\" she asked, ice dripping from her tune. He sighed and tried to wrap his arm around her, but she shifted away from his touch. \"They wouldn't have understood, Ally and you know it\" \"Danny, you thought that about me…why keep it a secret when it's just a part of who you are?\" She asked, hurt. \"Allyson, I trusted you and I didn't want anyone seeing me as a freak. I was tired of all that and I couldn't bear to see my parents disown me. Ok, you know them anything not normal to them is basically the spawn of the devil…and I knew I was a freak, but I\" He paused as Allyson grabbed his hands; their eyes locked together. \"Danny Sinclair, when I meet you, you thought I saw a freak, but you never knew the truth. You were my best friend, my protector, and my first true boyfriend. Without your powers you wouldn't be you… you wouldn't be the one that I love. You're not a freak never was and never will be. I'll protect you from everything that I can and I love you more than life itself,\" she said resisting her vows. Danny smiled and began to resist his own vows. \"Allyson Miller, when I fist met you I was lost and terrified about being myself, but you changed that and even after out fight you never gave up on me and you saved my life more times than I can count. It's because of you that I don't feel like a freak and an outcast,\" he ran his fingers through her hair, \"you're my golden angel and I'll love, care for, and protect against everything in this world.\" Their lips locked together in a passionate kiss. \"Wait, we forget the rings,\" Allyson laughed breaking away. Danny chuckled. \"not a problem,\" He raised his hand motioned forward and the ring ash flew into his out starched palm. \"I didn't think metal could burn?\" \"After all this time that's what you care about?\" Danny asked, a small smile creeping at the corners of his lips. Within seconds, the rings were fixed to perfect condition. Allyson smiled and played out the priest next words in her mind. \"Do you take him to be your husband/ wife?\" Exchanging the rings, they whispered, \"I do.\" -- I hope you enjoyed it and please review.

I hope you enjoy it. I OWN NIOTHING, but the plot. I hope you enjoy it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Max's fingers tapped in frustration; smacking a goblet off the table, the rim cut across his knuckles before it shattered onto the floor. The blood dripped down across his hand, but he welcomed the pain. His eyes shot up to the portrait of his old mentor; he had gained so much power that night, but at a high, of god a high cost and now a new power seemed to over him. A shiver crawled down his spine as his gaze shifted down into the fire. Fire, a flame of warmth, light, and passion felt by those weak enough to believe in such. Twisting away, he growled deep in his throat as the fire crackled beside him. From all his power, only one thing had weakened his hold and denied him at every turn. The name slipped from his lips in disgust, but tenderness of a treasured dream. \"Allyson,\" her name danced upon his tongue in a faint melody. His eyes darted over towards the flames crackling in a crescendo of noise, as deadly as waves in a violent tempest. Within the fire's glow, his dark gaze squinted as a familiar shape formed. A fragile body of a young girl….women dancing to invisible music within the safety of her bedroom. Her golden curls whipped past her face as she spun around; her feet pounding against the wooden floor, occasionally falling out of sync with the rhythm. Green eyes pierced through the flames as the fair skin seemed to burn away. Allyson turned sharply and bounced back towards her bed, plucking the guitar from its stand. His mind reeled as the figure began to sing-along, a large smile of white teeth flashed at him. Without thinking, his hand reached out and caressed her cheek; his skin tingled as he felt her own tender skin beneath his rough touch. As she spun away from him, he growled low in his throat and tossed the goblet into the fire, destroying her image. \"Damn you,\" he cursed; his hand still hovered over the place where her cheek had been. He felt her, always had….even at such a tender age of sixteen. The more power he had wished to gain only three years ago paled in comparison to her….his dark angel. A forbidden angel fallen for the devil…a young, frustrated, unskilled son of a Bitch won her love. He shook his head; he had never meant to harm her, but pain had won him over; only more power would make her be his and his alone. That day Allyson had been sent away, it had nearly broken his heart, but it was for her own good. He hadn't wanted her to get killed in the crossfire….it was too much. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Flashback \" Allyson's here,\" Hunter pointed off to the right, \"over there.\" \" Thank you,\" Max had whispered, shivers crawling down his spine. She couldn't be here. When Danny had escaped the weight crushing him, anger swelled into his heart; only one person could've saved him and that meant it was all a lie. Rising from the chair, he walked over towards the stage. Even from a distance, he saw Danny looking back over at her, the damned know-it all, the….sweet angel. Every sentence and gesture spoken between Danny and him seemed a distant memory, every touch felt like a betrayal. Suddenly, the redhead boy rolled a magic box onto the stage. Max didn't even have to ask who was inside. Turning towards the audience, Danny had said, \"Well every great magician deserves a lovely assistant, don't you think Max?\" \" Oh I don't know. It seems that whenever a new element has bee added, it can be a stinking point,\" Max stated before he thrust a sword into the box. Two more times; each time he felt himself growing stronger; both of them were at his mercy. As the last sword was jammed inside, a loud scream escaped her lips. \" Allyson!\" Danny cried, pushing the old wizard aside and opening the box; an empty sachet with glinted sliver knifes crossed over each other. Max smirked and turned back towards the crowd. Only moments later, a firm knock echoed from inside; Danny ran back a large smile curled at the corners of his lips. \"Allyson.\" From behind him, Max heard them whispering in hushed tones. Turning around, his breath caught in his throat while the two teenagers froze in terror for a moment. End of flashback ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Max shook his head; that image was burned on the inside of his eyelids. Those golden ringlets which looped around her ears as the stage lights danced upon the tight bun upon her head. That dark velvet dress with glitter sparking in the light fitting her slim, fragile figure almost perfectly; the bare arms swayed gracefully as she had stepped out from the box. \"So much like….\" His voice trailed off. It was pointless to think of it now, Damn his old mentor and now Danny Sinclair was repeating history. Max slumped into a chair and rubbed his temples just as Paul entered the chamber. Max didn't even look up as he asked, \"What is it?\" \"I found these old photo albums and I thought we might get rid of them,\" Paul said, adjusting the pile in his arms. Max nodded and his gaze drifted up; in less than a second, his hand shot out and grabbed at one of oldest books. He began flipped through the brittle pages and dismissed Paul. It had to be here….it just had to be. His hands trembled as his fingers brushed away the dust from a wedding portrait. Even after all these years, the bride's beauty took his breath away. Those golden curls and those warm, ocean deep blue gaze. Her slender body wrapped in a white sleeveless gown with a large red pendant in the center. His gaze drifted over towards the groom, the face ripped out from the picture. \"You should've kept her safe,\" he muttered to himself. Her life had ended so abruptly and his mentor was the only one to blame. Even the child had been lost to him that day….both mortals, but a wife and a child none the less. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Flashback \" You can't take her!\" Max cried, tears poring down his face. The sleeping child lay peacefully in the arms of his old mentor, unaware of the loss of her mother. Max jumped for her, but the older wizard held him back. Frozen in place, Max cried, \"Why, she did nothing to you…and….and\" \" And what, Max it was all a part of your training, you just couldn't protect the ones you care about,\" Antino stated calmly, a smug smirk danced upon his lips. He glanced down at the blood stained grass, the corpse only a few feet away. Turning back to his apprentice, he said, \"Think of it this way, you won't be a single father anymore.\" Without another word, he disappeared with the child. Max crumbled towards the ground cursing under his breath. A loud cough escaped the young brides' lips as she called out for her husband. Reality cam smacking back into him, the wind knocked out of him as he scrambled towards his fallen love. The baby blue dress was coated in warm, sticky blood as Max cradled her in his arms. Her fragile arms gripped his arms, panic soaring through her almost lifeless eyes. \"Protect….save…., her…I….\" Her head fall back; her body went limp as her arms fall back down to her sides. He cursed in rage, he wasn't powerful enough to protect or anyone he loved. End of flashback ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The same name escaped his lips as a single tear slid down his cheek. \"Allison.\" Her name sent both warmth and rage through him as memories soared through his mind. He turned back towards the fire, Allyson Miller's angelic, smiling face meet his firm, grim one. The child…young girl continued to dance around her room, a child named after her late mother. In a rage, he tossed the album into the flames, the pages burning almost on contact as her image was one more shattered. Max didn't have the power…the power to….he shook his head, as long as he didn't have the power, there was nothing he could so. Turning away, he stormed out of the chamber as the flames crackled behind him. Within the blaze, a single message was left undamaged, but darkened in ash and embers. Allison Cole wed to Max Miller! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This turned out a lot differantly thsn I had first plannned, but I hope you enjoyed it.

It had been about an two hours after thernfinal and she was getting worried. Right after the whole Max deal, hernhad left and now to his room and hadn't came out. \"Danny,rnit's me Allyson… can I came in,\" she called though the door.rnShe waited a few seconds, before she heard the door unlock. Slowlyrnshe opened it and looked inside. Danny was packing up and hadn'trnlooked up when she came into the room. Clearing her throat loudly sherngot his attention. \"Hey,\"rnhe said simply and went back to packing. Allyson stared at him andrncould still see a little flicker of fear in his eyes. Staying wherernshe was she softly asked, \"You alright?\" Atrnthat he looked up her and met her gaze. \"I'm fine Allyson…why?\"rnhe asked placing a pile of cloths in his suitcase. She walked up tornhim and took his hands in hers saying, \"I know how it feels Danny,rnbut you're alright and safe now.\" \"Yea,rnthanks to you and you know what it's like to be a freak,\" Dannyrnsaid removing his hands from her grasp. She sighed and then her eyesrnfell on the suitcase. \"Yourngetting ready to leave?\" she asked. He didn't say anything, butrnshrugged his shoulders and went back to packing. Sittingrndown on the bed she said, \"Well, your parents will be happy you'rernhome…do they even know what happened, I mean for real?\" Turningrnback to her he said, \"I don't think anyone else besides the threernof us know what really was going on.\" Allysonrnnodded, but a chill went down her spine at the thought of Max. \"So,rnyou're parents are waiting down stairs,\" she said turning therntopic away slightly from the final. \"Irnknow, but I'm not going with them,\" he said snapping his suitcasernclosed. Turning around to face him she asked, \"What do you mean?\" \"I'mrnnot going with my parents, it'll only put them in danger…I don'trnknow, but I have this feeling that Max is still out there.\" \"So,rnwhat does that mean?\" Allyson said. He didn't say anything for arnfew moments, just starred off into space almost forgetting she wasrnthere. He walked over his window and gazed out for a few seconds,rnbefore turning back to look at her. \"Irnmean…well you saw him, he's really powerful,\" he said lookingrndown at the floor. \"Yea,rnbut so are you Danny…I mean you were able to get the ring on hisrnfinger, which by the way great aim from being up in the air likernthat,\" she said trying to lighten the mood as she stood up from thernbed. Dannyrnlooked up at her unfazed by her attempt at hummer. Seeing this shernstopped and looked down at the floor. After a few moments of silencernshe spoke, \"So, where are you going to go?\" Dannyrnlooked at her, but didn't met her eyes as he replied, \"It's forrnthe best if you don't know…\" His voice trailed off as hernlooked at her. Shernnodded, but she couldn't keep tears away as she stared at him. Hernwalked up her and took her hands in his and brought her chin up untilrnthey were at eye level. \"Thankrnyou, Allyson Miller, thank you for everything…you're the firstrnperson to really except me for all of me…besides my parents, andrnI'll never forget that, ever.\" \"Danny,rndon't talk like that…we'll see each again won't we?\" shernasked unable to hide the sadness in her voice, but able to surprisernthe tears she held. Danny looked down at her saying truthfully, \"Irndon't know Ally-Allyson.\" Atrnthis Allyson's tears began to fall. Danny sighed and whipped themrnaway with his index finger. Allyson sucked up and held the rest away,rnbut the fact that he was going tugged at her heart strings. Dannyrnsighed unsure of what to do. After a few moments he spoke again,rnhis voice quiet and gentle, \"I have to go Allyson, but I'll tryrnto contact you as soon as possible, but I have to go.\" Allysonrnnodded, brought him into a light hug. Danny was a little taken aback,rnbut returned the hug just the same. Finally releasing her he said, \"Irnwant you to know, that meting you was the best thing that has everrnhappened to me Allyson.\" \"Andrnyou, me,\" she replied looking in his eyes. Danny looked down at herrnsaying, \"Don't forget me ok.\" Shernsmiled up at him saying softly, \"No chance Danny and don't yournforget about me.\" \"Thatrnwould be impossible,\" he said looking down at her. \"You,rnof anyone should know that nothing is impossible,\" she said. \"True,rnbut our friendship could never break I'm certain of it,\" Dannyrnsaid softly placing a few strands of her hair behind her ear andrnslowly letting go. Shernclung to his hand to her face as tears rolled down her face.rn\"Allyson, I have to go,\" he said pulling away. He gazed at herrnand then brought her into a kiss, so full of tenderness and feelingrnthat she lost herself n the moment Yet it only lasted a few secondsrnbefore she couldn't feel his lips against her own. She opened herrneyes, but didn't see Danny anywhere. She touched her finger tips tornher lips and remembered the kiss. She looked around the room a smallrnsad smile on her face. She knew that Danny would be safe and that hernwould return as soon as possible, because she believed in magic. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this short story, please review, Please and thanks ","Summary":" Hope you enjoy this one short.

This takes place a few months after the movie. It had been about a six months since the competition and Danny'srnpowers as well as his feelings for Allyson had grown so much. He hadrnmoved back to his parents' house after spending five months in hisrnsecret valley, feeling that his powers were strong enough to protectrnhimself. Now it was about time for him to face Max once again.rnAllyson was trying to find Danny, but he was no where to be found.rnShe was just about to give up when she heard a noise coming from hisrnparents' room. Quietly she entered the room careful no to startlernhim. He was sitting at a desk flipping though an old book thatrnlooked as if it could break in two an second. Quietly she asked,rn\"What are you doing in here?\" He didn't look up, but she knewrnhe knew she was there. \"Danny, what's wrong?\" she asked as shernsat down in the chair next to him. \"Please tell me, max isrnwaiting and you know he doesn't like to be kept waiting,\" shernsaid rolling her eyes slightly.

Danny sighed and said, \"look I really did you tornjust listen, I need to explain something to you.\" Allyson sat down and saying, \"you know you can tell me anythingrnDanny, go on.\" Danny leaned over the table as if unsure of wearrnto begin. Then deciding he said, \"come on you're a smart girlrnthink logically, you know that I'm a wizard, but then if I am howrncome my doves didn't appear when I popped the balloon, or when Irnwanted to see you, I had to walk to see you. Do you honest thinkrnthat's being an accident?\" \"What are you saying?\" Allyson asked. Once again he throw up hisrnhands and answered quietly, \"I was completely telling you the true,rnI'm a freak.\" Allyson shook her head saying gently, \"You're not a freak.\"rnDanny didn't look convinced. Trying again he said, \"Look about 3rnmonths ago I was walking to school and I saw a really cool magic bookrnand how much I wanted it, but it didn't show up in my hands, likernthe sake board did\" \"Why is that possible?\" Allyson asked now really concerned. Afterrnall he was supposed to be more powerful than Max, but Danny's magicrnseemed to be going backwards. \"I don't know, after that happenedrnI've spent months trying to figure what's wrong with my powers. Irncan't control my magic anymore Allyson, it's almost as bad asrnwhen we first met.\" \"That must be so scary for you,\" she said quietly. He noddedrnsaying, \"yeah it's…it's terrifying.

Allyson was totally confused; until she looked downrnto wear Danny was staring. On her finger was Max's ring. As soon asrnshe saw it a cool voice called from the doorway. \"Wonderful isn't it, Danny's going to die by the very personrnwho saved him once, how perfect,\" Max said sneering. Both Dannyrnand Allyson stared at him in shock and fear combined. Allyson triedrnin vain to get the ring off her finger, but as she had once toldrnDanny the wearer couldn't take it off. Danny stepped in front ofrnher and asked, \"I thought it had to be a magic person to work.\" Max shook his head saying, \"I made it more powerful, now thatrnAllyson has your Magic Danny, but the magic will be to strong causingrnboth of you to die.\" Danny's eyes had tears in them now, butrnAllyson has beside his side in an insistent. \"Danny grab my handrnand focus all your anger on Max,\" she said mentally.

I didn't trust him one bit and I couldn't let Danny getnhurt, because of him. Watching Max, I saw his finger flick as hentugged on his tie. I wanted to run, but my feet wouldn't move. Thenweight was about to fall and crush Danny. Suddenly, energy wentnstraight to my feet and I ran on the stage yelling out, \"Danny looknout.\" Hengazed up, but then darted out of the way, just in time. The weightncrushed onto the floor, breaking it. My heart was racing at topnspeed. Danny was also panting and I could tell from his face hisnheart was thumping madly too. Danny turned towards me, his eyesnhorrified and then he began trying to take off the ring. Yet, as Maxnhad said, he couldn't take it off, no matter who hard he tugged atnit. Running over to him and kneeling down next to him I asked, \"younalright?\" He nodded, but he was still shaken up a little bit. n\"Here, let me,\" I said, reaching for the ring. Justnas I reached for it, a hand gripped my arm behind my back. \"Well,nwell it looks like we're going to need a stringer stage,\" Maxnsneered. Forcing me up, he turned me away from Danny. As if he foughtngot about the show he said, \"Your choice Danny, your powers andnyour life for hers.\" With a flick of his hand a knife appeared hisnother hand; he brought it up against my neck. Danny stood up saying,n\"Let her go, Max now\" \"DannynNo you can't,\" I cried trying to break free, but his grip was toontight. Max shouted, \"Shout up girl,\" into my ear. 'Youncan't talk to my daughter like that,\" my mom cried from thenseats. At his distraction, I stomped on his foot and tried to reachnDanny's safe arms, but before I could reach him blackness fall overnme. I thought I'd fainted, but then I realized that I was in thensword box, on stage. I tired to get out, but it was locked. I wasnabout to knock, but before I could a blade fall in to my right. nListening closely I heard Danny yell, \"Max, I mean it let her go.\"nMax replied in an almost hummus tone, \"Oh Danny you must nownthere's a catch to this.\" Thennanother blade came in this to my left. Gasping I tired to get out,nbut Max was talking again, \"Last Chance Danny, surrendered andnshe'll be let go.\" I couldn't hear what Danny said next,nbut then Max said, \"Alright then, say good bye to your sweetheart.\"nWith that another blade cut through. I screamed as loud as I could,n\"Ahhhhhh.\" Incould have sworn I heard Danny yell out my name, but I couldn't bensure. One second I was in the box and then a blinding light and thennI was back in the box. I heard Max's voice saying, \"Peoplenplease seat down it'll all be over soon, and now lets have Dannynfinish his trick.\" I couldn't just let Danny down, finding anspot in between the swords I knocked as loudly as I could. I heardnfootsteps coming closer and I feared it might be Max. The door openednand I saw Danny's face. \"Allyson,\"nhe cried happily. Through clenched teeth formed in a smile I said,n\"get me out of here now.\" He nodded and said, \"Well, betternlate than ever,\" as he took out the swords. The coward was stillnroaring with excitement. Max was still trying to calm them down, as Incame out of the box. Hugging Danny tightly I whispered in his ear,n\"Don't ever think about surrendering your magic ever.\" Henstepped back and held out his hand. I almost laughed, \"Yeah.\" AsnI slipped the ring off his finger Max turned to us his eyes on fire.nGulping I handed the ring to Danny, Max asked coolly, \"What do younthink you're doing?\" Danny spoke up, \"Oh, I'm justnperforming my final trick Max, isn't that what you've wanted, allnthis time.\" Danny and I walked up to him together. Glaring atnDanny Max said, \"You're no match for me Danny, you know it, nonmatter what your powers will soon be mine.\" Danny leaned closernsaying, \"Never.\" Maxnturned his gaze towards me saying, \"Are you sure about that?\" nBoth of us saw Max's hands raise towards me. Danny stepped betweennme and Max, but at that instant Max sent both of us towards thenceiling. Maxnsmirked saying, \"you want to reconsider Danny, before you bothndie.\" Danny just glared at him not saying anything. Spinning hisnhand Max sent us spinning around. I almost felt as if I was going tonbe sick, I was deathly afraid of heights. Closing my eyes as we spunnsomething flashed in my mind. Max's ring. That was it. Opening myneyes still spinning I cried out to Danny, \"Danny, the ring…it'snthe last piece of the puzzle use it against Max.\" Henheld up the ring, but lost his grip, \"Darn it.\" He cried. Maxnlaughed, \"lost what you need Danny, well that's not the onlynthing you'll lose tonight.\" Asnif motioning me forward I flow down to him, his arms tightly holdingnaround my waist. \"Let, her go,\" Danny cried as he used his ownnmagic to lower himself to the ground. Max shook his head and oncenagain the knife reappeared in his hand. Danny watched horrified and Incould see his head pondering over what he should do. Out of thencorner of my eye I could see Cedric holding something small andnround. The ring. Dannynmust have seen it too, because he moved over towards him.

Maxncalled out one final time to him, \"Your choice Danny, your life.\"nHe drug the dagger into me a little more, \"or hers.\" Dannynyelled, \"Neither, Ally catch.\" He tossed something at me and Incaught it in my right hand. It was indeed the ring. Slipping it onnMax's finger, he pushed me towards the stage and vanished in ancloud of smock. Danny ran up to me and found me on the stage.nQuickly with his magic he healed the bleeding. Just then the smocknvanished and Danny and I got up and gave our bows. Asnthe crowed appealed I whisper in his ear, \"I knew you could do it,nthanks for everything.\" He shook his head and turned to face me,n\"no, thank you Allyson, I love you.\" Slowly he cupped his handnbehind my head and drew me into a kiss. It seemed to last annlifetime, but it only lasted a few seconds, before Ms. McCalisterncame up and said, \"it seems we have found our greatest kidnmagician, Danny Sinclair.\" Applause roared up as Danny took anothernbow. Afternthe show Danny and I sat in his room on the balcony, looking up atnthe stars. \"Planning on anymore magic tricks tonight?\" I asked.nHe smiled at me, \"The only magic tonight was you Allyson, I lovenyou so much.\" He sat there for a few more hours, JUST LIKE THAT.nWith me lying on Danny's chest and him stroking my hair.

If I owned Disney, I would rule the world…got it? Awesome. This is post-movie, as if Max were to come back and try to take Danny again. It does involve slight physical/mental torture and a hint of SLASH, but that's because Max is somewhat crazy and lusting over Danny's powers. BTW, I kind of think Alyson is a little annoying and Danny's parents are actually foster parents. Okay? Onward!!!! This is in Danny's POV and Alyson moved to Pensacola, FL. Even though that clock annoyed me, it proves to be a great tool to levitate. It's about 12:50 in the morning and I can't sleep, once again, so I'm levitating random objects around my room. If I didn't have magic powers, I would diagnose myself with insomnia and supernatural hallucinations. Lucky me, huh? The night drags on as I slowly feel myself drifting off to sleep. It's not the deep sleep I've been subconsciously praying about for the past few days, but it'll do. Soon, I heard that annoying alarm clock ringing near my head as I jerk up in my bed. Let's see… very little sleep + constant nightmares I'm plagued with = I need my coffee this morning. As I enter the kitchen, my foster mother rushes over to the table with a plate of pancakes and ushers me to sit down and eat. As much as I enjoy the great meal, I think my stomach can only digest so much in the morning…so I get coffee instead. After taking a shower and getting ready, I wish an apple in my hand and walk out the door. I walk at a steady pace in silence until I come around the corner by the large willow tree. Three-two-on- \"Danny!\" I keep my pace as I feel a presence next to me. \"Hey Alyson,\" I merely say. She starts to say hello back, but then dives right into a story about some mistake on a review that she somehow corrected. Of course, I only knew the gist of this because of her insignificant details, but I zoned out after awhile. Aly may be my friend, but sometimes she's too descriptive over the minutest matters, hence, my zoning out. So we walked to school, me being silent and her, talking the whole time. The rest of the day went as usual, boring classes with boring teachers. It seemed that the days just grew longer and longer. Finally, the end-of-the-day bell rang and I found myself walking down the street with Alyson talking about anything and everything at the same time. I keep walking, and once in a while I observe what going on around me. I look up from my feet and notice two little boys playing to the left of me. I look to my right, and I see- I stop. Not even twenty feet in front of me is the man I've had to hide from for the past two months: the Mystical Max. I can feel my heart trying to claw its way through my throat, beating erratically. My thoughts seem to become sluggish and mixed together as I can feel my lungs gasping for air. I can barely feel Aly's hands on my shoulders as a blinding, dizzy light floods my sight, and then turns to black. My head feels really fuzzy and my eyelids are too heavy. I barely have enough energy to open my eyes slightly and keep them open. And the subject of my first regained sight is…Alyson's face. Great. I slowly sit up when I realize Aly hasn't said anything yet. I look at her and discover that that was the initiative for her interrogation. Most of the questions were like \"What happened?\" or \"Are you alright?\" Feeling too tired to interrupt her; I sit and wait for her rampage to end. When it seems that she has quieted down, I start answering her questions. \"I guess I kind of freaked out because I thought I saw something. Then again, I haven't had a very good night's sleep in awhile,\" I shyly answer, never really liking attention. She looked contemplative for a few seconds and then turned back to me. \"Well, if it's sleep that's got you so wound up, then I've got something for that,\" she helped me up and we finished our walk back to my house. When we reached my front door, I pulled out my keys, knowing that the Sinclairs were still at work. Alyson and I stumbled up the stairs and into my room, where I threw my bag on the floor and flopped on the bed, not even caring about my position half off the bed. As I closed my eyes, I heard Alyson messing around with something; a rustling noise soon droned in my ear. I turned my head to see a bottle of pills in front of my face. \"Here. Take two of these a night, and you'll be out like a light,\" she watched as I popped two in my mouth, \"Are you sure you're going to be alright?\" \"Yes, Alyson, I'm fine. Thanks, can you see yourself out?\" I mumble, trying to get comfortable as the miraculous drugs quickly kick in. I'm not sure if she answered, but at the moment, I didn't really care. I was actually falling asleep.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: Asnyou should know before reading this… Now You See It… belongs tonDisney.

And now at thisnmoment, in my somewhat annoying and sluggish time frame, he wasnachingly getting closer. I couldn't really feel my body move (ifnit did move), but that may have been a side effect of the drugs. Asnin all horror movies, it seemed dark around us…and I was alone. nThis couldn't possibly get worse! Then, there's a change. The air around menbecomes thicker and tighter, as if I was in an invisible box with andepleting amount of oxygen. Now I know for a fact that I can'tnmove, the air surrounding my arms and legs feels like stone and I'mnsoon lifted lightly off the ground. In the midst of my panic, I looknup to see max a mere three feet in front of me, silently laughing. Indon't have time to retort as a searing pain erupts from my skullnand stomach. I scream as I feel blood pouring out of my agonizinglynpainful stomach. I look down, but feel myself grow cold in shock,nrealizing that there is no wound or blood anywhere. I shiver in painnand trepidation, trying to figure out what was really going on. Inlook back up at Max, who just grins and whips out a large dagger innthe air above his hand. My eyes widen even more as the dagger isnswiftly aimed and forced in my direction. As my eyes open, I cannfeel the scream at the back of throat cut through the silence of mynroom. I choke and grab onto my gray shirt that I wore yesterday,nneeding to check where the dagger impacted. All I see is bare skinnin the darkness of my room. The door suddenlynopens, revealing, my foster father flooded by a warm yellow light. \"Danny? Danny, arenyou alright?\" I'm still too shaken up to answer him, not that Inreally want to, seeing how the Sinclairs like to take one tiny thingnI say and turn it into a big deal. \"Danny, are younokay, son? Do you need to talk?\" Talking seemed like the lastnthing I wanted to do; my throat still felt sore and raw fromnscreaming. But in order to make him leave, I had to eventually talk. \"No, I don't wantnto talk about it,\" my voice sounds horrible, \"It was just annightmare. I guess it was caused by all the stress of exams.\" nWith this said, he started going off on a rant about schools beingneasier on kids and blah, blah, blah. \"It's fine; I'mnfine,\" I had to cut him off, \"I'm just really tired, so I'mngonna go back to sleep. Okay?\" I turn around in my bed, with mynback facing him. This must have slightly reassured him because henquickly nodded his head with a very detailed 'good night' andnclosed the door behind him, plunging my room once again in darkness.

Disclaimer:nI own nothing, except for my amazing Blackjack II Alyson'snPOV Insat down on my worn yellow quilt. My mom had made it for me when Inwas just a baby. I fell back onto the bed, exhausted and slightlynglad for the school week to have been over. My thoughts drifted andnfound their way to Danny, like they always do. Itnhad been a year since the showdown between Danny and Max. He alongnwith Paul had disappeared before anyone could catch them. Everyonenwas mystified by this disappearance but Danny. Dannynhad a feeling that Max was only hiding for the time being. Max wouldnbe back and ready when Danny wasn't. Max was waiting for hisnweakest moment. Thenrest of the world passed that night off as a lot of careful planningnand special effects. We knew the real truth, and in stride, Dannynhad to tell his parents his secret. They were confused, frightenedneven, at first. Though, they came to accept him and even got used tonrandom objects floating around the house. Onenday, not long after the finale, Danny got a weird feeling, almostnlike a warning. He decide it was time to hide, so he created anworld, a place so far away it would be almost impossible to find. Dannynand I had most definitely been in touch, and what I never thoughtnwould happen, happened. Danny Sinclair and I fell in love; his cloudnlike angst crashed into my sunshine like personality. It created anbeautiful site. It was like we fit together. Because, there has tonalways be a silver lining, a sun behind the clouds. Itnall started right after the finale. Danny had promised me he wouldnbe there whatever or whoever may come. I had a feeling that whoevernwas a dark power hungry wizard we all knew. Wenhad many secret dates, no one in the world but us, and his parentsnknew. I couldn't let my mother and father know. They didn'tnallow anything. I wasn't allowed to go to college until I was 25nand dating came after that. I have broken, or am going to break bothnof those rules. Infelt my room begin to shake; then a vicious wind tore through it. Incould feel the magic start to build up in the room. Danny wasnsending for me, but something was wrong. His magic told everything. Infound my self in a stormy valley, so much like the one Danny hadncreated for himself. This was different though. His valley wasnalways bright and calm or starry and beautiful. Thisntime, though, it was covered in violent black storm clouds and anhowling wind blew my hair from my face. I turned to see Dannynstanding there. He hadn't changed much in the month we hadn'tnseen each other, but he seemed more aged. Influng my arms around him. In those few seconds the wind andnlightning was gone to me, and I was safe. He let go of course andnthe storm continued harsher than ever. \"Alyson!\"nhe yelled over the wind, \"God, I missed you. I was worried Inwouldn't be able to get you in time. Max is back, really back thisntime, and he's ready. He's been watching me, I didn't know it,nbut he was. I knows I have a weak spot, he knows I'd do anythingnfor you. Aly, we need to hide.\" Thenreality of the situation sank in. There was no going back, ansadistic evil wizard was after Danny and me. The calm past year wasngone, and there was no turning back. \"Danny,nwhat about my parents?\" I asked shakily. Lightning struck a treennext to us and my scream echoed around the valley. Danny quicklyngrabbed me and pulled me into a cave nearby. \"Wencan't go back now, it'll be too dangerous. I'm almost sure Maxncan see who is traveling by magic, and is waiting for us to slip andnshow this place. I got you just in time. We can't do anything,nthere's no going back.\" He said gravely. DANNY'SnPOV Shenhad never had a good relationship with her parents. Her dad was annalcoholic and her mom worked a day shift, a night shift, and sleep innthe few hours in between. Allnher parents did was set rules, watch for her to break them, andnpunish her. Unfortunately, I knew what that punishment was…abuse. Somewherendeep inside me I knew she was relieved, but she was also morenfrightened than ever. I guess it was like the saying 'Out of thenfrying pan, and into the fire'. Instill remember when I had caught her dad beating her. Flashback Inwatched Aly walk onto her front porch. She had been so calm andncute….wait, did I just say that? Well anyway, she had been so calmnand sweet while we were studying at my house. But as we got closer tonher house I could see her getting nervous. Alynanxiously turned the doorknob at her house and step softly into thenfront room. I was about to turn and leave when I heard yelling. Inran to the side house window just to make sure everything was right. What I was hearing definitely wasn't alright. \" You!\"nher dad shouted while slamming a beer down onto a table, \"Wherenhave you been you little brat! You're supposed to go to school andncome right back! Hmm…let's see, you're an hour late! Wherenwere you?!\" Herndad slapped her across the face and pushed her into the corner of anwall. She fell to the ground loudly and cried out in pain. Incouldn't get into the house to stop him, and my feet were glued tonthe floor and my face to the window. I was unbearable to watch hernin pain, but nothing I tried worked, I couldn't stop him. Shenstood up and shakily said, \"I was studying at Danny's house.\" She must have chosen the wrong words because her dad punched her,nwhich sent her flying to the floor again, and kicked her harshly innthe stomach. \" Studying,nyeah right you little whore!\" he spat at her. \" Wendidn't do anything! I swear, I swear!\" she cried. \" Gonto your room, slut, I don't want to look at you anymore.\" Shenran, limping, up the stairs as fast as she could go. I could see anlight go on by the balcony in the back. Infloated up slowly and stepped gently onto it. I could see her cryingnon her bed. I knocked gently on her door. When she first looked upnher eyes grew wide and full of worry, but then she calmed down. Shenopened the door and put her arms around my neck. \"How much did younsee?\" she whispered. \"Enough,\" I murmured back. ENDnOF FLASHBACK Thenstorm was raging outside of our small cave, and it was getting worse. This wasn't just a normal storm. It had the tingle of magic innit; someone had created it. I had a sure idea on who that someonenwas. Inwrapped my arm around Alyson as we huddled in the farthest part ofnthe cave. \"Dannynare you strong enough to fight him? Can we win?\" she asked, I couldnfeel the fear mixed into the words. Inwhispered back to her, \"I will be, I have to be.\" Inheld her tighter and didn't even think of letting her go. Yeahnso here is the first chapter of Gotta Deal v.2. Haha I hope you likednit more, in my opinion it sounds much better. I won't have thennext 3 up as soon as I hoped. I had an insane weekend, but I hope tonhave them up tomorrow (Monday). Pleasenreview. They are strongly appreciated.[Chapter 2] Danny's POV Alrightnpeople here's this lovely chapter Disclaimer:nI own n o t h I n g. Danny'snPOV Itnhad been a week in hiding now. It had been a week since, Maxnuprooted us from our lives. Yet, I knew that the worst was yet toncome. Aly was really shaken up. We had traveled back to her housenyesterday to see if everything was alright, but nothing was right atnall. Itnwas so obvious Max had been there. The house was ransacked, and Maxnhad burnt his name onto a scratched up wall. I think this is wherenreality finally, truly sank in. Alyson'snparents were missing, but she didn't cry she held strong. I don'tnthink I will ever fully understand how someone so fragile andnbeautiful could be so strong. Indidn't want to chance traveling back by magic yet, so Aly and Inwalked around the city. We were passing a friendly looking bakerynwhen Miss McCallister stepped out from its warm yellow door. She sawnAlyson first. \"Alysonnis that you? Oh my! I have seen you in a long time, and…. Is thatnDanny, Danny Sinclair?\" I stepped forward and put up my hand in annawkward hello, \"It's been such a long time since I've seen you. Oh, yes, now I remember, I haven't seen you since right after thenfinale. Well, what brings you two lovely people out tonight?\" Ms.nMcCallister smiled kindly at us. \"Nothingnmuch Ms. McCallister, we're just out on an evening stroll,\" Insmiled desperately trying to get out of this conversation. Shennodded and said, \"Well I best be off, I need to get home\" \"Bye!\"nAly and I called after her as she walked down the side walk. Wenturned and started to walk again. \"Ohnwait! Danny, Alyson! Max was looking for you, but he couldn't findnyou. He said to give you this if I found you!\" Ms. McCallisternyelled running towards us. She handed me an envelope sealed with anwax crest. She walked away again. Inbroke the elegant yet sinister red seal and took out a neat note. Inhanded it to Aly so she could read it with me. It said: DANNY,nALYSON I have W onderfulnnews; Cedric w asnaccepted I ntonFi L mnCo L lege. F ornstarters, th I snis gra ND news! Y ounsh OU ldnbe happy for him !nI K i N dlynask O fnyou to W ritenback soon WHERE ever YOUnARE! Innoticed the odd format and the uselessness of the letter, but itndidn't click that it might be more than an average note. WhennAlyson started to freak out though, I knew something was wrong. Alynpulled me along the side walk and into a clean alley. \"Danny, wenneed to hide!,\" Aly cried out, \"Look at all the bold letters andnput them together!\" Indid as she told and I could feel the blood rush from my face as Inread the chilling sentence: DANNY,nALYSON, I WILL FIND YOU! I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE! Thisnwas bad, very bad. I pulled Aly out of the alley. It was crucialnthat we got to somewhere safer. Aly was the most important person innthe world to me, and I wouldn't let her get hurt. All I needed tonthink of was someplace we could go where no one, not even Max, wouldnfind out. Infinally realized something. No matter where I went what I did, I wasnputting someone in danger. Allyson had already lost her home andnfamily she didn't have anything. I was on the run constantly andnfor what...nothing. I needed to face Max sometime or another. Inalmost dragged Aly around a corner, and I crashed into an old man innthe process. Aly flew out of my grasp and into the man. Shenscreamed as I turned around. Infroze in horror at the sight I met. There Max was, with his handsnwrapped around Alyson's fragile neck. AllnI could think was ,n\"Oh god no, please, no!\" Inran towards her, but Max froze my body mid-step. I couldn't movenat all. Then, he began to speak, \"One move closer, Danny, andnAlyson will be gone. Think of that before making any extremendecisions. I have everything now Danny. I have the one thing thatnmatters most. I knew from the start she would be what you wanted anloyal friend….someone to love. You chose her instead of me, and nownyou must pay! This is the end Danny Sinclair!\" Max'snrant turned into yelling by the end of it. I wished I could donsomething, anything…. ALYSON'SnPOV Dannynstayed in place. I knew him well enough that he was thinking of a waynto get out of this. \"What do you want Max,\" Danny asked shakilynwatching me closely. \"Danny,nDanny, Danny\" he cackled, \"You are no match for me, nor will younever be. I am going to get your powers boy, and there is nothing youncan do!\" he smirked evilly. Angernwas boiling inside of Danny I could always sense his feelings butnthis was the strongest I had ever felt him. In a quick, almostnunnoticeable, flash Danny disappeared. Max tensed and held mentighter. I tried to get lose, but I couldn't escape. Inheard a familiar whisper inside my head, \"Alyson, Alyson listennit's me, Danny. I put myself in your body, he can't get me here. Plus, he won't hurt you if he thinks he can still use you to getnto me. Just pretend that you don't know where I am. Be strong!\" \"Brat! See, he left you! You really don't mean anything! Your worthlessnto us all!\" he slapped me hard across the face, but I didn't feelnanything. I could feel the magic in veins, protecting me. \"Inhave more important matters than some silly little girl! I'll bengoing, but remember, you aren't safe anymore, now that Danny hasnleft you!\" Max was gone in a cloud of smoke. Henknows I'm in you Ally that's the only reason he left you, he'snplanning something bigger I just know it. Right now just getnsomewhere with a lot of people and I mean a lot. Danny'snwords touched my mind. Inran down the streets of the town and ended up in front of a nightnclub. I was never one for dancing, or drinking, or hanging around anbunch of drunks, but this was always the most crowded spot in town. AsnI walked into the club a person materialized besides me. \"Alysonnyou just had to pick a club didn't you?\" Danny laughed. Innodded and pulled him onto the dance floor. We were laughing andndancing, we got closer and closer until we were only centimeters fromneachothers faces. Our lips were getting closer… \"AHLYSSSUN!nWhuuutuur youdoin herrre?\" A very drunk Hunter knocked into Dannynand me. Hunter stepped closer to me, while pushing Danny away. \"Hunter,nback off!\" Danny said stepping in. \"No! Alllysuun…dance wissth mee.

Henpushed Hunter off of me and walked with me to the other side of thennight club. \"Aly,nwe don't know if he's on Max's side or not, or if Max has othernspies here.

It was the worst part of school. Now, this wasn't thernnormal thinking of high school students. In fact, most high schoolrnstudents would cite lunch as one of their favorite times of day (thernother time being when school let out). Allyson, however, liked anyrnand all classes more than she liked the lunch period. Therernwere two reasons for this. One reason being that she understood andrnactually enjoyed all of her classes. Science and math presented herrnwith problems that could be easily solved with the right tools andrnmotivation. Her history class presented her with a story, withrnstories inside of it, and even more stories inside of those stories,rnand it was her job to find a thread that she could follow throughrnevery one. Her English class was just fun. She got to read storiesrnall class, and the fact that they were usually in some form of weirdrnancient English didn't bother her a bit. If anything it madernreading them more fun. By far her favorite class, though, wasrnjournalism. There she got to write stories of her own. She had tornresearch, investigate, and keep going until she got her answers. Sherngot to figure out the puzzle that was laid and figuring out puzzlesrnwas what Allyson loved to do the most. Allyson'srnaversion to lunch wasn't only because she enjoyed her classes; shernhated lunch period because she did well in her classes. This coupledrnwith the fact that she always knew the answer in class, and the factrnthat all the teachers loved her made Allyson's lunch very lonely.rnAll of her peers were intimidated by her. They all thought she wasrnsome sort of goody-goody, know-it-all, stuck up weirdo and theyrnavoided her because of it (unless, of course, they needed help withrntheir homework). This is why Allyson hated the lunch period so much.rnShe had no one to sit with or talk to. In class it didn't botherrnher because she was busy solving some puzzle, but during lunch, whenrnshe had to sit by herself, she really felt the differences betweenrnher and the rest of the student body. That was why she always triedrnto skip it. Today, however, was one of those rare days when sherncouldn't escape to the library or computer lab. Herrnparents had decided that she didn't have enough friends - Whornare they kidding? I don't have any friends - sornthey talked to the guidance counselor, who in turn told Allyson'srnteachers that she was not allowed to skip lunch and she was no longerrnallowed to work by herself all the time. She had tried to talk herrnteachers out of it when the bell rang for lunch, but it was no good. Sornnow besides having no one to sit with she was also going to be laternwhich was why she was nervously standing outside the cafeteria doors.rnShe cast one more imploring look at the teacher on duty and, afterrnreceiving a negative response to her unspoken pleading, she enteredrnthe one place she dreaded the most. Asrnsoon as Allyson walked in all eyes turned to her. She fought down arnblush and scanned the tables for someone who might let her sit withrnthem. After failing to find anyone, Allyson made her way to the frontrnof the cafeteria to get her food. As soon as she got her tray shernstarted walking towards the only empty table - the one right next tornthe janitors' closet. Before she even made it halfway there she wasrnstopped by the one person she really didn't want to see. \"Ah,rnAllyson, I'm so glad you made it. Now where do you want to sit…andrndon't even think about sitting by yourself. Your parents want yournto interact more so that is just what you are going to do. Now whererndo you want to sit? Oh I know, just follow me and we'll just getrnyou settled.\" Itrnwas Mrs. Davis the guidance counselor who was a no nonsense, friend torneveryone kind of person. Plus she talked so fast Allyson was reallyrnsurprised she hadn't fainted due to lack of oxygen. Allyson barelyrnstifled her groan, but shernobediently followed. However, when she saw where Mrs. Davis wasrnheaded she couldn't stop the groan that came. The Cheerleaders. Whyrndid Mrs. Davis have to pick the cheerleaders? \"Mrs.rnDavis, why don't I go sit with them?\" she said gesturing with herrntray to some of the people in her advanced chemistry class. Mrs.rnDavis looked to where Allyson was indicating and shook her head. \"No,rnyou need to interact with other people outside of your classes.rnThese girls are very friendly and they know everyone at Redmond andrnI'm sure they'd be happy to help you get settled back into socializing again.\"rnWithout waiting for a reply Mrs. Davis kept walking towards the onlyrnpeople in the whole school who Allyson really couldn't stand. Theyrnwere always starting rumors about her. Last week she heard one wherernshe was sleeping with her chemistry teacher for her good grade. Ohrnplease, like I need to sleep my way to an A . She was still arnlittle bitter about that one. \"Herernwe are. Girls this is Allyson, I'm sure you've met before. Shernneeds somewhere to sit today…do you think you could help us out?rnThanks ever so much. Allyson you'll be fine here. Bye girls.\"rnWithout so much as a look to see if the girls were as accepting ofrnthis arrangement as she wanted to believe, Mrs. Davis was gone.rnAllyson stared at the spot where the disillusioned counselor had justrnstood and muttered underneath her breath, \"Just like magic.\" \"Whatrnwas that hun?\" Allyson faced the group of girls with a littlernhesitation, but tried to keep herself under control. These girlsrnare like animals, they can smell fear , she reminded herself asrnshe saw the vicious look in their eyes. \"Why don't you sit downrnand we'll all get to know each other better.\" That had to bernMiranda, the leader of the pack, possibly the most ruthless andrnshallow person Allyson had ever met. The others wouldn't dare talkrnwithout her permission. Despiternher misgivings, Allyson sat down at the table instead of running forrnthe door like she wanted to. She knew Mrs. Davis could reappear justrnas fast as she disappeared. \"So, hun , what brings you out ofrnthe chemistry room?\" All the followers, whom Allyson consideredrnsheep, giggled at the tasteless joke. Allyson chose to ignore it. \"Mrs.rnDavis felt I needed to interact more with our classmates.\" Shernregretted saying anything as soon as she saw the malicious gleam thatrnappeared in Miranda's eyes. \"Sornhas Mrs. Davis decided to help all the losers in this school, or justrnthe Queen?\" Again the sheep all giggled like that was the funniestrnthing they had ever heard.

When she saw that her prey wasn't going tornfight back Miranda decided to go in for the kill…so to speak. \"SornAllyson, how's Mr. Reynolds?\" Allyson rolled her eyes butrnanswered. \"He'srnfine, why do you ask?\" Allyson really didn't like that look inrnMiranda's eyes. \"Wellrnit's just that I heard from a very reliable source that you leftrnthe Chemistry room very late yesterday.\" Allyson closed her eyesrnand took a deep breath. You will not sink to their level . \"Andrnnow that I think about it, don't you have a test in thererntomorrow?\" Breathe Allyson, just concentrate on your breathing .rn\"What were you doing in there so late? An extra study sessionrnbefore the test?\" Breathe in and out , just ignore her .rn\"Or where you, shall we say, doing him a favor that will keep yourngrade up?\" Atrnthat Allyson snapped. \"I'm sure you could ask Mr. Reynolds allrnabout that when you show up for your meeting with him this afternoon.rnIf I'm not mistaken you're failing that class, right?\" WhilernMiranda and the other cheerleaders gasped in shock - Howrndare anyone expose their faults - Allysonrnpicked up her bag and turned to leave. \"And Miranda? Mr. Reynoldsrngrades fair and you know it. You're just jealous.\" And amid thernindignant gasps, and outraged denial, Allyson exited the hatedrncafeteria. Whenrnshe got out into the hall she raced for the nearest bathroom. Afterrnsplashing cold water on her face, she stared at her reflection. \"Whyrncan't I find just person, just one , who would understandrnme?\" She shook her head at her how depressed and lonely shernsounded, and straightened up to leave. Then all of a sudden herrnreflection was replaced by a dark haired, brown eyed, sad lookingrnyoung man. Allyson stared at it in shock and just as quickly as itrnhad come the vision was gone. Allyson blinked a couple of times thenrndismissed the whole thing as a product of her over activernimagination. Asrnshe was leaving the bathroom a bright blue flyer on the bulletinrnboard across the hall caught her eye. Attentionrnall students between the ages of 14 and 17. Applications are beingrntaken for a chance to work on a Reality TV show run entirely byrnteens. If you are interested please contact Mr. Hart, the journalismrnteacher, for more details. This is your chance to be a part ofrnsomething magical. \"Well that looks interesting…\" And with a new idearnin her head Allyson went to go find Mr. Hart, and she completelyrndismissed the horrible lunch period she had just had, and wrote offrnthe vision of the brown eyed boy as a day dream, because Allyson knewrnit couldn't have been real. Right? Author's Note I've revised this story some, and I think it reads much better now.rnAlso, I want to point out that I don't have any problems withrncheerleaders. In fact, one of my best friends was a cheerleader in highrnschool. It's just traditionally that cheerleaders are the 'mean girl's'rnof high school. Also, I'm going to post the second chapter to thisrnreally soon. I'm not sure how long this story is going to be, but I dornknow where I'm going. I'm just not sure how to get there.[Chapter 2] Okay guys, here's arnteaser for my story Alakazam. It's already out, but I thought arnteaser would be a good way to end this story. Hernhated school. Absolutely hated it. Hated it so much that he had evenrntried to get his mom to home school him. His mom, however, thought hernwas too introverted as it was so there was no way she would help himrncut off all interaction with the outside world. Of course, this isrnexactly what Danny wanted to do. So now he was stuck going to arnplace he hated everyday. Danny,rnunlike most teenagers who hated school, actually had a legitimaternreason for not wanting to go. He was the school pariah, the outcast,rnthe freak. Of course no one had called him these things for quite arnwhile. Danny was the school freak, but he was also the only kid inrnschool that everyone (including the teachers) was a little bit afraidrnof. Itrnhadn't always been like this for him. He could remember a time arn(long) while ago when he had people who he considered friends. He'drnhad teachers who thought he was a good student. Of course that wasrnbefore Danny had been cursed.

This story starts rightnbefore the finale when Alyson is trying to warn Danny about the ringnand Max's evil plan. This story will mainlynbe in Alyson's Point of view but I might have to change to Danny'snfor some scenes. I hid behind a pillarnhoping no one else would see me. Hunter had probably already told Maxnand he was probably looking for me now. I had to find Danny and warnnhim I care about him too much to see him get hurt. I noticed Dannynwalk by and whispered, \"Psst, Danny!\" Henlooked around until his gaze landed on me. He walked over slowly likenhe was unsure of what to do. \"Alyson? What are youndoing here?\" he asked \"I've got somethingnto show you it's about Max's mentor Antonio DiMilio\" I said inna rushed whisper \"So\" Danny saidnwith a skeptical tone in his voice. \"So,\" Incontradicted \"He died during an on stage accident during a livenstage performance.\" Danny still looked unconvinced so she continued \"He happened to benwearing the exact same ring Max gave to you, and you're seriouslynsaying that doesn't mean anything?\" \"Yah\" Danny said. Incouldn't believe he didn't believe me, he was in real danger. \"Danny, you didn'tnhere Max down in the chamber with Paul. I did, and you are in realndanger here\" I said I could feel the desperate tone take over but Indidn't care I needed to protect him and I wasn't going to givenup. \"Alyson that isnridiculous\" Danny said \"Max is controllingnyour powers with that ring and I heard him say you can't take itnoff by yourself. If you still don'tnbelieve me just take it off and see how different you feel\" I said \"I don't want tontake it off I know how different I'll feel. I'll feel scared andnisolated and petrified of my own thoughts. I've been there and I'mnnot interested in gong back\" \"but you can learn tonmaster all that\" My hear was breaking he wasn't listing to me. \"Danny your on in onenminute\" Ms. McCallister said as she walked by. \"I'll be rightnthere Ms. McCallister\" Danny said \"Please listen to me\"nI said in one final attempt to save him \"I really don't want tonsee you get hurt. Look, I may not have solid proof about Max but Inknow I'm right He doesn't honestly care about you and I do!nPlease Danny I'm begging you to take a leap of faith\" \" I gotta go alright\"nhe said walking away \"wait\" I said henturned around \"At least you could let me take the ring off younmight be able to fight back if you need to.\" \"\"I'm sorrynAlyson, I… I won't do it.\" I watched as Dannynwalked away and let a tear slowly fall down my cheek. What was Indoing I couldn't give up, Danny was my friend and I care about him,nI had to help him. I snuck back stage and hid in the curtains. Inlistened intently as Max introduced Danny. \"Wait a minute mynfriend\" Max said \"you mean to tell me that a young skinny fellownlike you is claiming that he is able to lift that weight all on hisnown, that's a big weight one thousand pounds or pure lead, you meannto say that you dare to try to lift that and raise it over yournhead?\" said Max. So that was how he was going to do it. The samenway Max's mentor died. I watched as Dannyntried and failed to lift the weight. What was going on. I watched adnDanny tried again, nothing the weight stayed firmly on the ground. Inwatched as Max pretended to adjust his tie. The weight started tonlevitate under Max's control. Now it was raised above Danny'snhead and the audience was going wild. They loved it of only they knewnwhat was really going on. Danny held it above his head he turned hisnhead in my direction and smiled. I forced a smile back at him, Thenweight starter going higher and out of Danny's hands. It keptnrising until I noticed Max flick his finger again. The weight startednrapidly descending. \"Danny! Look out!\"nI yelled he jumped out of the way just in time. The weight wentncrashing into the floor. Danny was on the floor. Max started walkingntoward Danny, as Danny frantically tried to pull the ring off. Henturned to me and said it would not come off. I had to help him I hadnto do something. Max helped Danny up and they talked I couldn'tnhear what they were saying because they were speaking in hushedntones. Max told Danny to try again and do another trick. Then all the sudden Inwas in a box I didn't know where I was but I could feel it moving.nIt stopped and I heard Danny's voice. I couldn't make out what henwas saying. I needed to get out of here I needed to take that ringnoff and I needed to help him. Then I heard the sound of metal on woodnand the scratching of a sword and a long silver bar plunged throughnthe box just nearly missing my leg. Wait! That wasn't a bar thatnwas a sword a highly sharp highly deadly sword! He stuck in anothernone and I let out a small scream. I heard Danny yell mynname, and then I was in a cold sealed off room there were no windowsnand no doors, how was I ever going to get out of here? I walkednaround pacing I had to do something I sat down to had beenn10 minutes and nothing had happened. Then I felt a tingling sensationnand I was back in the box and Danny was opening the door. I was in anPurple sequined dress and I looked like and actual magiciansnassistant. \"you don't give upndo you\" Said Danny \"Not when it isnsomething I care about.\" I said giving Danny a small smile. He held his hand behindnhis back and I pulled off the ring. I figured that if hengot the ring on Max then Max's Powers would weaken. \"Danny you have tonget the ring on Max's Finger. He did and when Danny put the ring onnMax's finger Max disappeared. The audience clapped and Dannyngrabbed my hand and kissed it. I felt the blush creep up on my face.nWe were thrown out of out trance when we heard the audience clapping.nWe both bowed them left the stage. \"lets go to my room\"nDanny said grabbing my hand and rushing down the hall before anyonencould stop us. When we got to his roomnI sat down on his bed and he started pacing the room. \"I am so sorrynAlyson, it was all my fault if I had just listened to you.\" He wasnblaming himself I should have been more convincing it was my fault. Ingot off the bed and walked over to Danny. \"Dan…\" I was cutnwhen he pressed his lips against mine. When we broke apart henwhispered \"Alyson I am sonsorry is there anyway you can forgive me for not listing to you?\"nThere was no need for him to be sorry, and I already had forgivennhim. \"it is ok Danny\" Insaid \"It is not our fault Max was believable you thought he carednabout you, it is ok.\" He pulled me into a tight embrace thenngrabbed my hand a squeezed it. \"Alyson…\" henwhispered \"Come on you justnwon! It is bad TV if you just disappear after you won come on let'sngo see your parents.\" We both laughed and then got up. 'Okay letsngo\" Danny said. I looked at out clothes \"um… do you want tonchange before we go because I do\" I said tugging at the dress. Henlaughed and shook his head yes. \"I will meet you innfront of the Hall of Mirrors in half and hour\" he said I shook mynhead and rushed off to my room. I didn't have anything to wear Inhad cleared my room out when I left, and all my clothes were in thenHotel I had planned to stay at. Suddenly Zoey was standing in thendoorway holding a pair of jeans, a pink tank top, and a brush. Inthanked her and she left. I changed quickly thenjeans were a pair of nice light jeans with faded and slightly rippednknees and the tank was just a plain tank with pink lace at the top. Inbrushed my hair and let it fall in curls. After that I walked out ofnmy room and went toward the Hall of Mirrors.[Chapter 2] Now you see it... the Last Minute Twist Disclaimer: If I owned this movie then there would be a lot more romance in it so... yah I don't own it XD When I got to the Hall of Mirrors Danny was already there and he was talking to Brandon. \"Hi,\" I said as I walked up to them \"I was just telling Danny about the party Ms. McCallister has planned for us\" Brandon said. \"Cool.\" I said looking at Danny \"Brandon!\" Hunter called from somewhere back stage. \"I have to go.\" Brandon said \"Hey Alyson, do you want to go to the party with me, you know like a date.\" I was taken aback I though Brandon hated me. \"Brandon I can…\" I started to say before I was cut off by Brandon saying \"Great see you there!\" What was I going to do I didn't want to go with Brandon I wanted to go with Danny. \"Danny…\" I said turning around to look at him. He had a grim look on his face ane he looked like he was trying to hold something back. \"What?\" I said \"Nothing\" he said I had only known Danny for a few moths but I felt like I knew him better then anyone else. \"There is more…\" I started to say \"Yes there is, Alyson I… I hope you have a good time at the party with Brandon\" He said I looked at Danny and a small smile tugged on my lips. I locked my arms around one of his arms and said. \"\"Why don't we go to the party together, I never accepted Brandon's invitation.\" There was a look of disbelief on his face and then it went in to an unreadable poker face that even the master puzzle solver could not decipher. \"No, Alyson\" He said \"You have to go with Brandon it would hurt his feelings if you didn't go with him.\" I knew it was true but I wanted to go with Danny. I mumbled something of a goodbye as I removed my arms from his and walked to my room. I laid down on the bed. Well this is great I though to myself, I am going to have to make sure Brandon knows we are just friends, I don't want him getting the wrong impression. I slow got off the bed, it was 7:30 I still had half an hour until it was time for the party, so I decided to get ready. I slowly walked over to my closet in there was a long flattering dress it was pink and it fit almost like a second skin. I pushed the dress aside if I was going with Danny I might have worn it but it was not appropriate for going to a party with someone who was just a friend. Behind it was a skirt, it was short only mid-thigh and it was a soft blue and it had a sparkly floral pattern on it. I matched it with a white shirt that when paired with the shirt revealed a very small section of my stomach, but was not as flattering as the pink dress I had previously looked at. I appraised myself in the mirror and decided that this outfit was also not fit for a friend. I switched the shirt for one that was longer and the V neck on this one was not cut as low as the other one. I once again appraised myself in the mirror; this was fit for a friend I thought to myself. After my outfit was chosen I finally looked at the bottom of my closet where all my shoes were. I selected a pair of strappy black sandals with a low thin heal. I applied a light amount of natural makeup and I looked in the mirror for the last time. I looked go but not too good I though happy and content. I had decided to let my hair fall naturally curly mainly because I did not have the time to do anything with it. It was already ten past eight and I was running late. I walked out of my room. Where was I supposed to be meeting Brendon again? I asked myself. Oh, right the main hall I said to myself after a minute of thinking. I walked down the first set of stairs, but I paused when I saw Danny standing there. \"Hi!\" I yelled down to him. He looked up at me and waved. I walked down to stand by him in front of the door \"I have to go, I will talk to you later\" I said. After getting nothing more then a nod from him I walked out into the main hall. Brandon was waiting for me. I walked up to him tugging on one of my curls that had fallen in front of my face. As soon as he saw me his face lifted into a huge grin. He walked toward me and took my hand. I walked besides him not touching him as we walked into the dining hall. The dining hall had been converted into a dance hall of sorts. There were couples dancing together to a slow song. I gulped I had not thought about dancing I was so pre-occupied with my appearance. Brandon pulled at the collar of his shirt, he was nervous. I walked with him over to the punch bowl and got us two small cups. We stood there drinking our punch and watching the other kids dance. I didn't know what to do, but I didn't have to. I heard a small cough from Brandon and then he asked me to dance. The song was still a slow, and as Brandon lead me to the dance floor I could see the slight blush in his cheeks. We walked to the dance floor and when he got there he wrapped his arms around my waist and I put mine around his neck. We swayed to the beat, and I could feel everyone's eyes on me. They all know of my feelings for Danny and Brandon isn't exactly a loner. As we danced I noticed Brandon's Face getting closer to mine. I tried to pull away but he would not let me. Without me even noticing the space between us closed and his lips were pressed against mine. I pushed him away, I knew Danny was watching I could sense even though I could not see Danny I knew. I pulled Brandon aside his face is a bright crimson and I know he is confused. \"Brandon\" I said \"I think you are a great guy but I do not have the same feelings you do for me, I… I like Danny\" I said the last part as a whisper afraid to hurt Brendon but also afraid of giving him the wrong impression. \"You like… Him?!\" Brandon said pointing to Danny who was now standing in the corner of the room nearest us. I nodded not quite ready to admit it to everyone, the kiss had confused me even further and I don't know where that relationship is going. \"Brandon\" I said so that is attention is now focused on me again. \"I would really like it if we could remain friends\" But before I could finish he was gone he stormed out after giving Danny and I both glares. I look in the direction Brandon had gone then I looked back at Danny. What was I going to do this has become a big huge mess. I looked at Danny one final time and then slowly started to walk up to my room. I walked slowly thinking about Danny then Brandon then Danny again. When I finally got to my room I locked the door behind me, I didn't want anyone to see me. I took off the shoes and threw then in the corner. I left the skirt and shirt on and climbed into my bed. I pulled the soft red blankets over my head to drown out any noise but I still could not fall asleep, I had too many thoughts running through my head.[Chapter 3] Now you see it... the Last Minute Twist Okay well I am defiantly going to be more frequent with my updated it is Christmas break and I have nothing to do!!

But he was not resentful, for he had one truenfriend, someone he could trust with his secrets, he could even trustnhis life, Allyson Miller. He and Allyson had met back in 4th grade,nwhen he had just moved to town. On that first day, when a fat bullynnamed Franky had punched him in the gut, she had helped him. Everyonenhad seen it, but she was the only one who even came up to ask him ifnhe was alright. They had been best friends ever since. And now here he was, age 13, on hisnway to his first day of the eighth grade. He sighed for a moment asnhe passed the local skate shop Sk8 X. Danny had always lovednskateboarding, mostly because it was solitary. Like I said, he didn'tnhave many friends. It was also something he was good at, mostlikelynthe only thing he would ever be good at. He stared longingly at thennew skateboard in the window, it had a red and black dragon on thenbottom, and the fresh wheels were soft and clean. It screamed out 'nRide Me!'. If only he could, he didn't have an allowance, and hisnonly income was feeding his 94 year old neighbor's 15 cats for andollar a week. At that rate it would take him a little over 2 yearsnto earn enough for that thing. Realizing he was going to be late fornschool, he stopped ogling at the beautiful ride, bowed his head, andncontinued to walk. All of a sudden he felt like he wasnflying , or floating. He looked down at his feet, to see that he wasnon that board. He stopped, a little to hard, he fell down into thengrass \" Ouch\" he complained. He quickly picked up the boardnto examine it, it was indeed the hundred dollar board he had beennadmiring in the window display only seconds ago. He hadn't evennentered to the store, what the heck was going on. He picked himself up off the groundnand got back on the board. \" Well, as long as it's here!\"nhe thought. He rode the rest of the way to school on it, half dazednby the appearance of the board. And half not caring, because it wasnsuch a sweet ride. But the thought was constantly nagging him, hownthe heck did this thing get here? It just appeared, or had he Made itnappear? He was so deep in thought that hensmashed into Allyson , \" Sorry Ally!\" he said as he helpednher up. As they were brushing off their jeans,nAllyson commented, \" Nice board, Danny. Where'd you get it?\" Danny's eyes widened, what was hengoing to say to Ally. She was his best friend, best he would end upnin a mental hospital if he told her that he had made a skateboardnmagically appear under his feet. \" Umm, I.. I got it for uh..nhanukkah . Yeah hanukkah.\" Allyson arched her eyebrow, \"nReally Danny. For one, It's September. And second, you're not Jewish!nTell me where you really got it!\" Danny gulped. \" It..It doesn'tnmatter. \" He quickly gathered his things and hurried into thenschool. Allyson was flustered, what was going on with that boy? Theynhad always told each other everything. So what was the big secret,nhad he stolen it? No! It wasn't possible, so why wouldn't he tell hernwhere it came from? She raced after him, but he was nonwhere in sight. She finally caught up to him, itnturned out they had the same homeroom. Their teacher, Mr. Flanner letnthem out to go to their lockers and load up their stuff. She walkednup to him at his locker.\" Danny what's you're deal?\" He spun around to look at her angrily,n\" My Deal, is that I need some space!\" she said slammingnhim locker door. She inquired again and again duringnthe day, he left school grounds for lunch and hanging out in the allynbehind the school. Why was Allyson so curious? He was having a littlenbit a crisis right now, could a he respect that instead of gettingnall up in his face. He decided that before he told anyone, evennAllyson, what was going on, he would ask his dad. Maybe this was anpuberty thing. He threw a rock a the brick wall opposite the one henwas leaning against. What the hell was he thinking, oh yeah, makingnrandom objects appear magically by willing them to. Not Normal. Thenbell rang, he pulled up his hood and shoved his hands in his pockets.nHe was a Freak.[Chapter 2] Danny's hair fell in his eyes as henstared down at the ground, not paying much attention to where he wasngoing as he made his way back for history and math class. One againnallyson was pounding him with questions as to where he had been andnwhy he was acting so strange. He gave her a dark stare before jammingnhis locker shut and rushing into homeroom. Allyson followed him in.nShe payed no attention as Mr. Flanner called out the attendance andnjust stared at Danny. He staring down at his desk. The bell rang andneveryone got up to rush off to afternoon classes. As he made his waynthere, he was careful to make no eye contact. History dragged on as the old man withnthe tweed coat tried to explain the curriculum. Even Allyson thenbrainiac couldn't help but let her mind drift. As the minutes draggednon like hours, she gazed at Danny in a seat across the room. He wasnin the corner, no one sitting in the desks next to him, he had hisneyes closed and was thinking hard about, well something. She was sonfocused on figuring out his sullen mood, she had all but forgottennthat 59 minutes had passed... \"BUZZ!\" the bell ran loudly,nmaking her jump in her seat. Seeing this, Danny smirked as he exitednthe room. That's when she saw him, Franky. Thenstupid guy had cropped black hair, and he wore a white t-shirt underna jean jacket. He was a monster, and an evil child. Allyson gagged,nshe hated him to the core. He had once punched a guy so hard in thenribs, that he now wore a brace around his torso to keep him fromncollapsing. He also had the I.Q of an earthworm. She should havenknown, it was the first day, and every first day, he punched Danny innthe face. No reason why, he was just such a cold blooded person. Onenday, she and Danny tried to make up a nickname for him, so far theynhad Garlic-Breath and The Beast .nAllyson had suggested that he was just like DraconMalfoy , from the Harry Potter series, Danny wasndumbstruck. After a couple of awkward moments, Danny laughed, \"nHe's all round and red in the face. So how about, ThenApple !\" They had both rolled over laughing. Coming back to the present she sawnFranky heading strait towards Danny. She just stayed there, a statuenin the hallway, what could she do? The Apple would just kill her ifnshe tried to put a halt to his fun. So she just stared, the bloodndrained from her face as Franky shoved Danny up against the lockersnwith a thud. Danny looked up at him, and gave him a death stare. shenhad never seen him use this expression, he must really not be in thenmood. Franky must of saw that too, becausenhe gave a wide, evil grin and punched him in the gut. And Dannynfolded in pain, he swung his fat arm up, punching him in the face.nDanny looked up, he looked like a reck, he had a bloody nose and ansplit lip. He gave Franky the death stare again, it was almostnfrightening. And then he was gone. Franky was nowhere to be found.nAllyson blinked, but he had completely vanished. Danny was wide eyed,nhe gazed in shock at where Franky had been. A look of pure fearncrossed his face, then he quickly dashed down the hall. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What in the world just happened! First,nFranky is attacking me, I'm wishing he would get lost, and he's gone!nGONE! I saw Allyson across the hall, she was mystified. Oh no! It wasnme, the little magical freak! Not that I wasn't happy that I had justnsaved myself from a broken jaw, but still what the heck! I picked up my stuff and just bolted.nI went strait to the bathroom to clean up my face. I looked like Inhad been hit by a car. I cleaned off my face, but I would still nondoubt look like I had been in a fight. I ran to math class, where Ms.nBrewer gave me a lunch time detention tomorrow, great! I sat down inna empty desk in the corner, trying to hide my eyes from 20 curiousnstares. At least Allyson wasn't in this class with me! It seemed like an eternity before thenbell finally rang. Thank God! I rushed outside, I wanted to get homenbefore Allyson could bore me with more questions. That's when I sawnabout 10 kids staring up into the old oak tree. I looked up, my jawndropped. Hanging at least 10 feet in the air was a flailing Franky,nhanging from a rather feeble looking branch by a single belt loop. Inlaughed, wow, never thought I'd be doing that today. Franky pointed a stubby finger at me,n\" Sinclair! You little demon! You did this didn't you, you..nyou.. you filthy little rat! You cursed me!\" I didn't look back,nI just ran, full speed away from there as fast as my legs would carrynme. He probably sounded like a fool to most, but it was true. He wasnright. I HAD done this to him. I felt like punching myself in thenface. I needed to talk to my dad! Maybe he could explain all of this,nor bear through it with me! I ran into the house, he was alreadynsprawled out on the couch. \" Get into a little scuffle at schoolndid ya son.\" he laughed. I just nodded, I had all but forgottennmy face. \" Listen, Dad. Something weird has been going on!\"[Chapter 3] Danny lay sprawled out across his bed,naching. He rubbed a bruise on his arm, then winced, it was stillntender. What the hell had happened? It all started at dinner, with thenmost awkward conversation he had ever had. His father was quitenunderstanding, more so than he would have expected. As they werenclearing the dishes, his father suddenly asked a surprising question.n\" Are you sure Danny? About these powers.\" Danny noddednfervently. \" Well in that case-\" . Danny shuddered, from there on it wasnjust a blur. Mostly because it was all painful to be able tonconcentrate on all that was causing that pain. The last thing henremembered about it was a stinging of tears in his eyes, then hisnfather, \" You Little Freak!!!\". There was a sharp pain, andnhe was out cold. He rolled over to check the time,nwincing as his shirt rubbed against the scars on his back. It wasnmidnight. He had been out for several hours, what had hit him anyway?nHe drooped as he lazily got up to put on his pajamas, he had to wakenup for school in 6 and a half hours. God! he had completely forgottennabout school, he made a mental note that a hoodie and jeans was hisnnew wardrobe. He had to hide the scars, looking in the mirror, hennoticed that his hands and head had been left alone. Mostlikely tonavoid suspicion. He also noticed that there were burns around hisnwrists, odd. When had this happened? His jaw dropped, had his fathernburnt his own, unconscious, son? The answer was clear, right there onnhis wrists. A low moan escaped him, and he broke down in tears, nonone, not even his own father loved him. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The next morning Danny wore a hoodienand baggy jeans. He slumped down to breakfast, barely awake. He hadnbeen up until 3 a.m crying, until he had collapsed with exhaustion. His father on the other hand, wore anbemused expression, the vile man.

Liona was an undercover monster as people talk these days and i would know cause im her one day i was on my way to earth cause my planet was invaded by vorgans and i was just 6 sent with my baby brother leo my mother shouted \"liona get on the visatron\"which was a fancy way of saying transporter so i ran to the transporter and i took my brother and that was the last time i saw my home family and friends 10 yrs later \"no im not going to another adoption family that wants an alien \" i whined ugh humans are so greedy i use to wanna come here as a gorgan baby but i did not know of humans and ever since i got here i was forced to learn their langauge and custom and me and my brother were split up into different adoption familys and every week i get a new family cause i keep accedentily exploding their house's and yeah so right now im talking to the person who keeps giving me different homes shes wierd and has brown eyes and a old days dress with huge i mean huge brown flowers on it and she has long brown hair put in a 1980 hairstyle and she has tiny slender lips adding to that a egg shaped head i think thats what humans call it so as me and ger argued i just burst out of their fully inraged my face was as red as a baby vorgan and fire right where i step realy no humans know what they are dealing with so i stormed out of the adoption plannery room outside and took of in the air all the way up to the tower of pizza and i always came here since i got here when i wanted to be alone but they put a micro chip in me so they know where i am at all times even when im invisible i have exactly different powers in different moves so yeah and today was a rather cold day a bit breezy but nice and the clouds and sky was gorgous until you look down into what humans made of earth people screaming horns honking ugh somtimes i wish i stayed at planet zilagon it was nice air was pure as gold the sky as yellow as the sun and dirt as brown as the piluted water of earth and now here i am still dont know all the customs and there are more i think than a 100 langauges and i only knew one as i took a deep breath in i heard loud bangs as if a vorgan just shot one of their blasters i was scared as a stalion when they hear a shot of a gun as i looked down in horror their was a guy with a school of children on the ground quivering in fear for a 10 yr old student has fallen by the blaring shot gun with 40 guys with guns surounding them with fingers at the trigger so my reaction was of course flying down but luckily i am bullet proof only two things can kill me my brother and a gemstone found in my planet which is impossible since its gone so i flew down all prople stared in aww the man pointed their guns at me and shouted \"if you come closer we will kill u and these children\" i kept going though most children were crying with tear stained faces as they tryed to shoot me the bullets just bounced of me rhan the cops came i froze cause if they saw me trying to save children id be a study of scientists and become a weapon so i burst if into the air watching the gun shits from above i saw a child who looked familiar as i focused in it was my brother leo he was not sitting or quivering he was just standing there writing i thought ugh just sit down i had a choice between him or me but i could get him and me so i flew as quick as a crypton and grabbed him he immediately knew i was his sister we know who is our blood and not he gigled as we lifted ti the air since hes a child on 10 he only has friendly powers none of which could hurt you so he was defencless but the humans rid him of any knowledge of home so he was mostly human but as i took him he yelped \"what abot the others liona \" i awnsered him \"i can only help u not them\" and people of my world kniw there familys name till they die even if they were taken away as babys so i took him to the adoption center and said to the wierd lady \"if i get adopted any where's he is coming he is my brother and i dont care what it takes\" suprisingly she said yes and a lady walked in wearing a nice blue long dress with a little bow in the back and she was tall moonlight skin and eyes of the night sky hair as red as rubys she said in a nice soft voice \"i will be adopting you and your brother i have a nice big house on the southern shore of montreal it will take a long plane ride but we

As this ship with her stout crew slipped away from the shores of Venden, I had view of the gleaming rooftops of the great hall of Hurot, and, turning away, of the gray and vast ocean before us. Now as it happened … \" Now as it happened, I believed my adventures with the Northmen to have ended. My mission was complete and the Eaters of the Dead had been vanquished, the tale of Buliwyf drawn with sounds. Verily, the tome had not been closed forever … Little did I know that my line was to return to the Northman's lands. - - - I had never been one for boats. We had them at home in Baghdad, along the river Tigris, and I had always done my best to avoid them. The way the water licked up at the sides, always threatening to pull you down in made me uncomfortable beyond belief. My father, however, seemed to spend all his time on the decks of a long ship of his own creation. Every inch of it was painted black, and it stretched out long enough for at least fifty men. He said this was in the style of the people of the North, and I had asked him why many times, but he would never tell me. All I knew of his love for the North was that he had been gone at the time I was born, sent on a mission by the Caliph, and that my mother had never understood why he didn't just stay behind. This always brought up an uncomfortable conversation between the two, something that I was never allowed to hear. It was adult speak, they said, though I knew it was an argument. Father often offered to let me spar with him. This I was confused by: around our neighbors he would be as calm and collected as the most well-trained animal, but when we two were alone, he acted as if he were some wild spirit. I had not once taken him up on this, seeing as my mother always thought it to be silly, and I did not want to be silly. There was never any need for me to fight, apart from the occasional teases of the other neighborhood boys, but even then I preferred my words. It was not until I discovered the dusty tome of my fathers writing that I began to take interest in his offers. The writings were entitled \"The Life of Buliwyf, King of the North,\" and were hidden in several different places in my fathers study. Parts of them were written in a foreign language, ugly to the eye, but the parts I could read written in my own Arabic language were of great magnificence. The stories told of, from what I could gather, a great and brave warrior who led his men in the battle against an army of demons, called in some places the wendol and in others the Eaters of the Dead. He, with his band of 13 warriors, defeated the wendol in order to protect the kingdom of Rothgar, yet Buliwyf himself was poisoned by their mother. He died shortly after, but not before killing the leader of the wendol's army forces, ending their reign of terror over the North. It was a valiant story of a brave man, but what was most surprising to me was the fact that my own father had fought beside him as the 13th warrior. I was stunned. My father, who seemed nothing more than a crazy man who spent too much time away from home, a warrior. - - - \"Father,\" I began, swallowing what felt like a rock. He, myself, my mother, and my two sisters were sitting around the small table we used for meals one night, exactly three months after I had first read the story of Buliwyf. Of course my immediate instinct was to consult my father, but I had not had the opportunity - nor the courage - to do so until now. This felt like something that could wait no longer. \"Who was Buliwyf?\" There was an awkward moment of silence as he set down his eating utensils, ignoring my mother's disapproving glances. \"How did you hear of this man?\" Was his response, not as welcoming as I thought it would be. Had it been wrong of me to ask? Should I not have read that story? Was it supposed to be a secret? Biting my lip, I spoke up again, quieter this time. \"I … I read the story you wrote … I just thought that … Erm …\" My lungs felt like they were choking for air, even though I had been gasping throughout my speech. I had just as much right to know as he did, didn't I? Why did I feel that I was about to cry? Maybe this was the story my mother had never let me hear. This was the adult talk. \"Was he … a friend of yours?\" Mother coughed, signaling that it was time for my sisters to clear the table. Sadly, as if recounting and ancient memory, my father rested his arms on the table. \"He was … my brother, of sorts,\" Ahmad replied, looking down. Perhaps I wasn't in trouble after all! \"There were 13 of us, up in the North -- you have heard this?\" I shook my head, reminding him that I had never been allowed before. Looking back at Mother as she reached an arm out to stroke his arm, Father replied, \"It is time you heard. After all, Buliwyf once said to me that a man might feel wealthy if his story were to be drawn out, and I don't see how I am to fulfill his wish if no one ever knows.\" - - - It was late at night, and the two of us were seated outside by the river. A few boats passed by quietly, illuminated by torches, and father's sat, bobbing in the water, sleek and black and beautiful. Being the middle of the summer, we were both dressed in a loose white cloth and sandals, he in a turban, casual for men in Baghdad. Bright stars twinkled overhead, and thanks to my Father's teachings, I was able to recognize a few of the constellations. We sat for a while more in silence, listening to the sounds of the water, until father had finally finished organizing his thoughts. \"When you were born, this I'm sure you know, I was not here.\" I nodded, pulling my legs about me in the sand. \"I was on a mission of the Caliph, to teach Yiltawar the ways of Islam. However, throughout my journey, I was introduced to a group of Northmen who were on their journey back to the North. At the time of my arrival, their king had died, and a new one was to be chosen. One of these men was Buliwyf. He and his warriors were preparing to return to Buliwyf's home of Yatlam, a village in the North, farther than you shall perhaps ever go. Before their departure, an old Crone of the village with the dead king, the Angel of Death as she was called, informed him that his party must have a total of 13 men, and the 13th could be no Northman. This is how I came upon the epic tale of my lifetime, and we set sail for the North as soon as possible.\" Listening in deep interest and respect, I listened as my father recounted the tales of he and the warriors, Buliwyf included. By the end of his story, I had been moved to tears, and had to hide my face in my hands. Father seemed somewhat pleased with this, yet distressed at the same time. How wrong my mother, sisters, and I had been! He was not crazy with the North -- he was speaking the truth. I could not fathom why he had returned home. \"Because,\" he replied when I asked him this, \"I had you to come home to. And also, I don't think the Caliph would be pleased if I had not completed my mission.\" Nodding subtly, I spread out on the sand, looking up at the stars. Were they the same that shone over the warriors as they slept tonight? \"Ihsan,\" Father said after a moment or two. Looking up at him, I responded: \"Yes, father?\" \"Do not let this trouble you,\" he said with a bit of difficulty. I could see that it indeed troubled him. With a tinge of discomfort, I nodded. Of course my own father should have known me better than that. These Northmen were my business now.

Day had surrendered; the last bright echoes of the sun hung in the firs on the west side of the valley and lent colour to the otherwise sombre view. He had missed this place. The warrior's grey eyes thoughtfully considered the clear night. There would be fog tonight: hundreds of stars winked into view even before the vestiges of stubborn gold faded from the tree-line, and suddenly the night sky became a vast and solidly touchable thing. Then the wind lifted and stirred string-like clouds across the sky and he wondered in surprise if they might avoid the mist after all. Tapestries billowed out from wooden walls and thudded back into them, and somewhere small bells rang in the wind. The change in weather was so abrupt that he briefly considered returning to the hall to tell the others, but instead he kept his eyes on the forest. Brushing his loose hair from his face, he focused his gaze on the edge of the clearing where he saw nothing, not even the movement of deer or the faint silhouette of a bird winging in the dark. There was something there nonetheless. Its presence was a foreboding weight which the leader recognized as a heavy tension. It settled somewhere under his ribs: it was not fear, this weight, but it was wariness, and yet it hardly felt equal to the weight of the sword on his back. He was not so easily stifled by the shadow that held sway over the people in the hall behind him. He caught himself hoping the wind would die down. He knew the women with their children to protect and even the men in their weariness and the heaviness of long years all silently kept a hopeful watch on the night and prayed for clear skies; but for his part he could hardly help them keep their lives if he never had occasion to lift his sword. At least if the fog came he could touch such shadows in some tangible way. The air current shifted behind him as a servant came with their torch-light spreading over the deck while they lit the sconces at last. He turned rather quickly when he felt the servant's touch on his arm. It was not a servant after all, but Weilow, Hrothgar's queen, who surveyed him calmly from strong brown eyes. He felt her reserve as he had from the first and he was almost glad for it. Whatever her reason for coming she didn't speak, but took her hand from his arm and leaned over the rail next to him instead. \"I thought you were a boy who had come to light the sconces,\" he said after a moment of quiet. He saw the silhouette of her smile. \"I did light them,\" she replied seriously, and he saw that she had. The quiet returned; he wondered what it was the woman beside him was working up to say or if she really did intend to speak much at all; she looked perfectly at ease with her elbows on the smoothed wood railing, her silver dress sleeves rolled up to reveal fairly muscular tanned forearms. Her hands were rough – that much he could see even in firelight. It occurred to him her life thus far had probably not been easy. She had aged well in hardship if that were the case; there was no stoop of sorrow to her shoulders and her eyes were bright and keen and proud and heavily lined by laughter. The only real difference separating her from the woman in his memory was in all these things, though it was one thing all the same; she held herself apart from him in some intangible way and he felt that this road, in particular, was closed off from him. Even her smile seemed weighted before-hand. He realised too late that his thoughtful and preoccupied gaze was directed at her face. Her own thoughtful look came into focus and the intensity of it startled him; but then her eyes softened immeasurably and she sighed. \"He knew what he was doing when he took me as his wife,\" she said. Her words were nearly stolen on the wind and he leaned in to hear, her purposefully quiet voice low and honest. She did not look at him and he wondered at her words and her meaning. \"He knew about you,\" Weilow said, in answer, and he understood. She breathed deeply beside him and straightened, pressing her palms down against the railing. \"He is a good man, not without compassion, but he believed I would be a good queen, for him. For his hall and people.\" She paused, clearly wondering what more she should say. She looked up at him over her shoulder: \"I convinced him to send for you, but he did not wish to, for he believes he has already cost you enough.\" That Hrothgar had taken her even in awareness of Buliwyf's intentions did not surprise the warrior overmuch; he had long suspected it. That the man still felt ashamed of it after all these years surprised him more than anything – had the pick of any maiden not been a king's due? But as he looked at Weilow beside him he saw that Hrothgar had not been the only one reluctant to send for him. It was the horrible and steady threat of annihilation that had pushed her to it. He wondered how long they had waited, and if in the following months they feared he would come too late to an empty and rotting hall, a pyre-hall for all their people. And he saw, too, that she was proud. Buliwyf thought suddenly of the carved chair in her husband's hall in which she sat near his throne; of Hrothgar's trusting glances in her direction; of Wulfgar, her son. He thought of her strong dark arms and the lines of joy around her eyes. There was peace in these things. He turned to her slowly and shook his head, almost imperceptibly. \"He owes me nothing.\" Weilow regarded his words curiously, but then her face smoothed out into a true smile. He watched the transformation with only a touch of sadness in the midst of his great respect; she was as resilient as the land around her – the land which tugged at him still , even when he was far south of it. As she did. As he suspected she always might. Something in him wanted her to know that he understood and did not begrudge her any happiness she had found. He bent his head toward her and his face was largely masked by a thick fringe of white hair. \"What you have... is enough for me to be glad.\" He smiled back at her, his voice low; she could barely hear. \"I am proud.\" He felt her lift his hand and press a kiss to the palm against the calluses that would always be rougher than any of her own. She released her hold just as quickly and faced him tall and straight. \"Thank you,\" she said softly, and then she was gone. He had not missed the shine of her unshed tears. xxx Some minutes passed. The wind died down, leaving the crisp touch of an early summer's night, and a mist rose up to meet the settling chill. Buliwyf returned to the fire in the hall. His sword was a welcome weight against his spine as he walked to Herger's side and sat next to him. \"So?\" asked the slender blond man, his cheeks flushed from the fire and not drink. Buliwyf looked at the throne some feet away where Hrothgar sat, his wife's hand on his arm as she leaned in to speak to him. When his gaze returned to Herger he was almost smiling, but for what reasons Herger couldn't discern. \"There is fog,\" he said at last, and he was glad. I love this movie; every time I watch it, I see something new. Thanks to Mlyn of the 13th Warrior LJ community (13 underscore warrior), I realized I wasn't the only one who felt there might be a relationship between Buliwyf and Queen Weilow. Buliwyf is respectful of Hrothgar but it is often the King's wife who he looks to for advice; and when he dies she is the one who carries his sword. I also tend to think he has too much esteem for Hrothgar to mess with his wife, but maybe there was something between the two before she married. Mlyn has a lovely fic on this which everyone should read, over at LJ.

All the characters were made up by me and are © to me, exceptrnAhmed. This fiction tells the story of Ahmed as he travels back to Baghdad,rnwritten as a sequel to the film. Forrnthe umpteenth time, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan cursed the raging sand that whippedrnaround him. He hated sandstorms. Acursed sand! It got everywhere: in his eyes,rnin his ears, even down his cloak. Sometimes he almost missed the mud and filthrnof the north. Even so, would be glad to get back to Baghdad and finally bernclean again. 'Ahmed!rnMaybe we should stop now…' A disembodied voice echoed through thernsand. It took a while for Ahmed to realise who the man was talking to. He hadrngrown so used to being called 'Eban' or 'LittlernBrother' by the Northerners that he had almost forgotten his real name.rnHe checked around to make sure the other members of his party were still visiblernand shouted his approval. Wearily,rnthe five men turned back until they were all huddled together, blocking outrnmost of the sand from their faces. Nevertheless, they still had to shout tornmake themselves heard. 'We'rernlost!' Wailed one man. 'We'll never make it tornBaghdad!' 'IfrnAllah wills it, we will live.' Returned Ahmed, perhaps a little louderrnthan was needed. If he had survived the Wendol attacks, he was going to livernthrough a sandstorm! 'Jahwarrnis right, Ahmed.' A second man argued. 'Do you know where wernare?' Ahmedrnwas silent. It was true: he didn't know where they were. But once thernsand had cleared and the sun had risen, he would be able to tell which way itrnwas to Baghdad. Whether they could find food and water was a different matter.rnBeing lost in a vast desert is dangerous when you leave the trail. Goodnessrnknows how long it would take them to find supplies, or how far off the trackrnthey had wandered. 'Setrnup camp,' He told the weary faces in front of him. 'We can dornnothing until morning.' Grudginglyrnthe men dropped the argument and fought their way through the sand to therncamels. Ahmed watched them thoughtfully. When he had met these men, all thosernlong weeks ago, he had thought that all his prayers had been answered. Arnhard-working crew of determined Arabs, all looking to return to Baghdad, justrnlike him. He would simply slip in at the back and follow their lead, helpingrnhere and there with food and water, but generally staying in the background. Herndidn't want people knowing about the months he had spent with thernNortherners. People may begin to think he was cursed. Butrnthings hadn't worked out as planned. As soon as the other men had seenrnhow skilled Ahmedrnwas at survival skills, and how, sometimes, in a dire situation, he knewrnexactly what to do, they had elected him leader. At first, Ahmed had stronglyrnobjected, but the other men just took him for granted. Whenever they wanted torndo something, they went to Ahmed, or when they needed a final decision, theyrnlooked to him. Finally, Ahmed had reluctantly agreed, but sometimes he stillrnfelt uncomfortable. His place was with them – working hard and obeying,rnnot above them. Ahmedrnsighed, and went to help the men, who weren't being very successful withrnthe shelter. Sometimes they really needed his help. Ahmedrnwoke to the familiar smell of a fresh, new sunrise. With his eyes still closed,rnhe breathed in deeply. Then he shot into a sitting position and his eyes sprungrnopen in anger. Sunrise! They should have started out hours ago, before the dayrngot warmed up! Silently, Ahmed cursed himself. This could add a whole day orrnmore to their travelling time. Some great leader he was! Hurriedly, hernscrambled to his feet and shook the others awake. Moans erupted from all aroundrnthe shelter as the tired men woke up. Ahmed scowled. If these men wanted him asrna leader, they were going to have to learn discipline. Ahmedrnquickly grabbed the gourd of water and went around the shelter dumping a loadrnon each mans' face. This time screams were heard as the startled menrnjumped up. By the time he got to the last man, everyone was fully awake. Ahmedrnsmiled. 'Thatrnwas a nice treatment!' He barked, mockingly. 'Next time I'llrnput scorpions in your beds!' Thernmen looked at the floor, ashamed, until Ahmed started laughing. Slowly, theyrnall joined in and started their duties to prepare for the day's journeyrnwith a smile. Hoursrnlater, Ahmed began to regret his rash actions to wake the men up. They had notrnfound a single hint of water all day, and the water that was left was runningrnout. Although there was no sand blowing around their faces today, in fact,rnthere was no wind at all, the sun was beating down mercilessly and the menrnneeded water at regular intervals. They had been travelling non-stop. Ahmedrnwanted to make up for the lost time he had wasted sleeping in, and they werernall paying. Eventuallyrnhe called a halt. Panting and sweating, the men sheltered under the shade of arnrock, the only landmark that could be seen for miles. The camels lumbered to arnstop and sat down, resting from their heavy load. Ahmed checked the water.rnThere was only enough for a couple more hours. He turned to the men. They werernwatching him expectantly, some of the younger ones begging him with their eyesrnfor a relief to their thirst. It wasn't going to be easy telling themrnthat they couldn't. 'Therernis not enough water left.' He looked up at the sky and then down to hisrnfeet. 'We must carry on without it.' Therernwas a shocked silence. No one knew what to say. They had all been relying onrnAhmed and he had failed them. At the last village, hadn't they collectedrnmore than enough water for several days? Realisation dawned and horror spreadrnon the men's faces as they remembered what Ahmed had done with it allrnthat morning. Onernman drew his sword. 'You!'rnHe howled, pointing it at Ahmed. Ahmed quickly grabbed his own sword. 'Dornnot challenge me, Sayyid.' He warned. Ahmed had far more skill andrnpractice in sword fighting that any of the other men. He would beat Sayyidrneasily. But he was a member of his group. How could he fight him? Sayyidrnswung his sword. Ahmed parried the blow and stepped backwards. 'Stop!rnHow will this make things better?' ButrnSayyid didn't stop. The light of fury was in his eyes. This man hadrnbetrayed them all in his stupid anger at their sleepiness and he was going tornpay! He thrust the sword again. Ahmedrnwas at a loss of what to do. If he fought, it would make him lose moisturernquicker, and lose them time to search for water. If he didn't fight back,rnSayyid would kill him. If he quickly ended the fight with Sayyid's death,rnwould the other men then turn on him? Or leave him? Ahmedrnblocked and pushed Sayyid backwards. He stumbled, but didn't fall. Nearbyrnthe four other men watched, frightened, their faces white and drawn, wonderingrnwho to support. Both men had done wrong. Their leader had not taken care ofrnthem properly, but Sayyid had attacked another member of the party, somethingrnthey had all sworn not to do at the beginning of the journey. Sayyidrnroared with annoyance and ran for Ahmed, head down and sword pointed. Ahmedrnsidestepped and threw himself towards the ground. Sayyid's flailing legrnflashed in front of him. He grabbed the foot and pulled. Sayyid fell sprawlingrnand his sword clattered to the ground. He twisted on the ground, snarling.rnAhmed advanced to put his sword against his throat. Sayyid lay still. 'Yournare not helping us, Sayyid! Stop -' Ahmedrncried out as Sayyid's leg shot out and cracked into his arm. His swordrnflew through the air and landed next to Sayyid. Grinning, the younger manrnpicked it up. Ahmed backed away, cursing. He knew he was cornered. With no weaponrnand an injured arm, he was at a great disadvantage. Gritting his teeth, hernjudged distances. Sayyidrnstood up and began walking slowly towards Ahmed. He knew he had won and wasrngoing to enjoy every minute of it. Ahmed watched Sayyid warily. As soon as hernwas close enough, he began to back away again, but this time curving slightlyrntowards him. The two were circling each other. As soon as Ahmed was where hernwanted to be, he yelled. As he suspected, Sayyid thought Ahmed was about tornattack and lunged with Ahmed's sword. At the same time, Ahmed rolledrnbackwards. Ignoring the jabs of pain in his arm, he kept rolling back. Sayyidrnhadn't expected Ahmed to move so fast. His thrust had brought his whole weightrndown and he thumped to the floor again. With a howl of fury, he leapt up andrnran towards Ahmed. Ahmed kept going. Skidding to a halt, he picked uprnSayyid's discarded sword. Sayyidrnstopped. He knew he couldn't beat Ahmed in a duel. The fight was goingrnout of him as the sun beat down harder and the light of fury was fading. With arnlook a great contempt at Ahmed, he threw the sword away. Ahmedrndarted it to pick it up. After making sure it wasn't damaged, he smiledrngrimly and put it back into it's sheath. He glanced at the shocked facesrnof the rest of the group. 'Setrnup camp.' He ordered. 'We shall rest here.' Turning away fromrnSayyid, Ahmed marched behind the rock, leaving the others to sort things out. Thingsrnwere definitely not going as planned. Sighing, he slumped down. The sharp painrnreminded him of his arm. He would need to bandage that. Ahmed closed his eyesrnand lay his head against the cool, damp face of the rock. He was exhausted.rnSoon the sun carried him off to sleep. Thernnext thing Ahmed knew, he was being shaken awake. Blearily, he squinted openrnhis eyes and shook his head. 'Ahmed!rnWake up, Ahmed!' At the sound of a voice, Ahmed sat up and opened hisrneyes properly. He was surprised to see he was in a tent. He was also pleased tornsee that his arm was in a sling. Someone must have brought him. He twistedrnaround to see who the speaker was. 'Ahmed,rnyou must come and see!' Jahwar was kneeling beside him, his eyes shining.rn'You have found water!' Ahmed shook his head again. How had hernfound water? He had been asleep! He quickly jumped up and followed Jahwarrnoutside. Thernother men were crowded around the rock and Ahmed could hear water splashing.rnJahwar quickly explained. 'Irncame to find you an hour ago, after the fight. You were asleep, so I was goingrnto bring you in. Your clothes were wet. I thought you were hurt at first, butrnafter you were in the tent I checked the rock and underneath it was full ofrnfresh water!' Ahmed looked up, amazed. He had just had a fight overrnwater, and all the time it was right under their nose! He looked at Jahwar'srnexcited face and, relenting slightly, he smiled. He joined the other menrnsplashing and washing themselves. It was only when he was drying himself did hernrealise that he couldn't see Sayyid. Lookingrnaround, Ahmed started to get worried. He knew it was stupid, but he thoughtrnthat he should go and say sorry for humiliating him in front of the others.rnAhmed quickly left the others and walked around the rock. He finally foundrnSayyid in the only place where the rock cast a shadow. 'Sayyid!'rnHe called. Sayyid didn't move. He stood deathly still, head down and eyesrnwide open. Ahmed stopped, confused, then started walking towards him again. 'Sayyid?rnI've come to -' He froze, and a bitter-tasting fear shot him in thernchest. Now he could see why Sayyid was so still. There was a giant snake at hisrnfeet. Asrnslowly as he could, Sayyid raised his head until he faced Ahmed Frantically he started mouthing: helprnme! Ahmed shook his head to unfreeze it, then wished he hadn't. The snakerncaught the movement and lifted it's ugly head. It's tongue flickedrnout and Ahmed could just make out the sharp teeth that lined the roof ofrnit's mouth. He didn't know much about animals, but he could tellrnthey were full of poison. Ahmedrnclosed his eyes and waited for his heart to stop beating so fast. When hernopened them, they were full of grim determination. Here was a way to get Sayyidrnto trust him again. Slowly, carefully, he reached for his sword. If he couldrnthrow the sword and hit the snake in the soft spot below the neck, it would diernimmediately. But if he missed, it would anger the snake even more, and it wouldrnattack either Sayyid or himself. Ahmedrnfinished bringing the sword out and, closing one eye, aimed carefully. He onlyrnhad one shot at this. When Sayyid saw what he was doing, his eyes widened inrnfear, and he pressed himself against the rock, with his eyes tight shut. Ahmedrndrew back his arm and threw the sword his all his might. Asrnsoon as he threw it, Ahmed knew he had missed. Instead of going straight it hadrnveered of at a slight angle. It came as a great surprise when he heard thernsnake scream. He looked up. Sayyid had only just thrown himself out of the wayrnof the sword in time. The snake had leapt for him, but as the sword fell, itrnhad pinned down the snake's tail, leaving it thrashing around in pain,rnbut still alive. Sayyid lay on the ground just out of the way of the snake,rnhunched up and trying to blink away tears of fear that had sprung to his eyes.rnAhmed collapsed to the ground as the adrenalin leaked away, leaving him feelingrnshaky and weak. Hernheard shouting as the other man appeared from around the rock. They took in thernsituation immediately and one of them picked up a rock and threw it at thernsnake, hitting it squarely under the jaw. The snake fell, twitched and layrnstill. Ahmedrnbarely knew what happened next. In a slight daze, he felt himself being carriedrnback to the tent and after murmuring a brief thanks, he closed his eyes andrnfell asleep. Ahmedrnwoke in the middle of the night. Someone was standing over him. He grimaced andrnsat up, squinting through the darkness. It was Sayyid. 'I...I...'rnHe stuttered. 'I wanted to...' Ahmed smiled. 'Yournfeel bad about yesterday? Do not. It was both of our faults. Rest now. We arernclose to Baghdad.' A look of immense relief swept over Sayyid'srnface. He nodded his thanks and crept back to his bed. Ahmed settled down againrnand slept with a smile. Thernnext day Ahmed woke everyone up on time and they were well on their way by therntime the sun came up. Slowly, but surely, first appearing as a speck, but thenrngrowing recognisable, some large sand dunes loomed up out of the heat haze. Therngroup stopped. 'Ahmed,rnthe dunes are too wide to go around.' One man suggested. 'It willrntake longer to go around than over.' 'No!'rnExclaimed another man. 'We do not know these dunes. They could bernunstable and collapse at the top.' Ahmedrnstudied the dunes. Indeed, they were wide, and going around them could takerndays. He didn't know how far it was over the top, though, and that couldrntake longer. 'Wernwill carry on for now. We will decide when we are closer.' Soonrnit became apparent that the climb up the sand dunes was not as steep orrndangerous at had first appeared. There were plants holding the sand together,rnand the closer they got to the dunes, the wider they seemed to get. Theyrndecided to go over. Thernwind picked up as they trudged their way to the top. Every so often they had to stop as someone scooped sand outrnof their eyes. The dust the camels picked up was worse and soon everyone wasrnwalking in front of them. Most kept their heads down and eyes as slits, justrnopen enough to see where they were going. The sky was pure blue and the sun wasrnshining like a ball of solid gold in the sky. Ahmed could almost feel someonerntelling him that today was the day. Suddenly,rnthe sand ended and they reached the top of the mound. Ahmed felt anrninexplicable feeling in his chest, like his heart rising hopefully to hisrnthroat, and further, until complete joy seemed to explode from his head. Slowlyrnhe looked up and his eyes told him what his heart already knew. Baghdad hadrnappeared on the horizon.

None of which belongs to me. The story was written for Mojave Dragonfly's rnrequest for Yuletide 2005. \"The Ties that Bind Us\" by Karen The sheer contrast in landscapes between the north and the south is only the first shock rnthat Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan must cope with as the ship commanded by Hrothgar and his rnband of warriors makes landfall in Heverland. He endured the ribbing and the teasing, and even the abuse both physical and verbal and rnthe crude jibes of the men. He is also dealing with his stomach's rebellion to the to the rnship's motion as they crossed the rough and choppy waters of the ocean and later on the rnNorth Sea. It's not like his home country of Arabia. Although he had not expected it to be when his Calif and ruler dispatched him off to the rnhinterland of the empire to record his observations and then report back to the palace. It rnwas an honorable commission even though it came about due to a most regrettable rnindiscretion; his dallying with the Calif's wife notwithstanding, Ahmed nevertheless did rnhis duty. As things turned out he never even reached that remote outpost, instead he finds himself rnon a cold, wet, sandy shore in the company of rough, uncouth barbarian warriors. He has spent enough time among them that he picked up a smattering of their guttural rnlanguage. The ships are long and narrow and plough through the water like snakes that drag their rnbellies through a field of grass. The men laugh, shout, cure, and even spit, cry, and every rnexpression in between, throughout the task of bringing the ship into the shore and rnmooring it so it will not float away with the tide. It is all done with a great deal of noise rnand economy of movement. It seems that a boat crewed and oared by slaves is unknown among these men; Ahmed rndiscovers that while there are many differences between his and these people, if he can rnmaster the queasy feeling in his stomach, he might actually enjoy this adventure. Later at the hall Ahmed doesn't like the hall, too high and narrow, and talk about drafty; he thinks and rnshoves the thought to the back of his mind. He has struck up an unlikely friendship with rnBwuilf and with a fellow by the name of Herger. I have learned to communicate with by rnmeans of rough line sketches, waving hands, and lip-reading. rn rnLearning of a threat of a monster that preys on the king and his peoples does not daunt rnBuliwyf for long. After all, this is what they have come all this way for; a change to face rnmortal danger at the hands of something either monstrous and or supernatural; preferably rnboth. The monster is a Grendel, or perhaps that is its name, Ahmed is not entirely certain rnbecause his attention is distracted by the sight of a rather attractive girl passing in and out rnof the hall, bearing a cup of brimming liquid to the men. She has hair like nothing he has rnever seen in his homeland where both men and women are almost uniformly dark-haired; rnthe girl's hair is like spun gold, and she catches his eye with a wary but intent stare of her rnown. \"Careful, those hands have been known to strangle chickens,\" his friend whispers out of rnthe side of his mouth, the recently healed scar left behind by a knife during a brawl rnaboard the ship making the scar twist down in a sardonic twist. The gleam in his blue eye rnis friendly enough so Ahmed takes the comment in stride. \"I don't intend to learn how to do that,\" Ahmed whispers back. \"You might have to, my friend, if you intend to pursue an interest in the girl.\" The first night spent under the king's roof and they have already lost two of their men. rnThe warriors' last agonized, dying screams still haunt his sleep. Bwulf is furious and burns off his anger and frustration by stalking around the compound rnlike the caged white tigers that Ahmed has seen in the his Calif's menagerie. The effect is rnremarkably alike,' Ahmed thinks, watching as the big man paces the length and breadth rnof their quarters. \"Is there anything I can do, Sir,\" Ahmed asks, risking breaking the big man's rnconcentration. \"Unless you have some dame eastern remedy for bringing the dead back to life, there is rnlittle we can do but wait until the monster strikes again,' Buwlf shouted, then rubbed his rnhands through the strands of his hair. \"I have a very bad feeling about statements like that. Ahmed shook his head and looked rnup from the stool where he sat polishing the slender curved blade favored in his home rncountry over the hard, unforgiving lines of the northerners long and broad swords. \"It is said that they can be prophetic.\" Ahmed wondered at his own temerity and daring, rnthis man is strong, powerful, and quick to fly into a fit of rage. Back home Ahmed would rnhave to go through innummerable preliminaries before he even considered bringing his rnown arguments and concerns to a man in such a position of authority. 'What is this land rndoing to me, and is a good thing or a bad thing?' he thinks, shoving the thought aside. \"It means we are cursed with bad luck even before we begin,\" the big man muttered into rnhis blond beard. \"No,\" Ahmed replied. \"It just means that luck can run either way. A wise man must learn rnto know the difference and make his own luck.\" \"And just how does a wise man do that?\" \"He trusts his own knowledge and heart, and when that fails, to the skill and hearts of rnthose he leads,\" Ahmed said. \"Easier said than done, my friend. In the days to come I fear we may require more than rnjust good heads on our shoulders and stout hearts.\" \"Then we shall rely on faith.\" \"Does your Allah watch over you so far away from home?\" \"I believe he does,\" Ahmed replied, shaking his head at his own firm belief. Throughout rnthe voyage and even in the aftermath of the attack on the hall, he still believes that his life rnwas spared for a reason; although it did take quite a bit of soul-searching and a talk with rnhis friend to restore that belief. Catching Buwlyf's watery blue icy gaze once more rnAhmed hears the big man whisper: \"I wish I had faith like that.\" \"You might yet.\" \"So you are telling me while we have breath in our bodies, there is still hope. Off with rnyou, I must think on this alone.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: The 13th Warrior and all mentioned characters belong to Touchstone rnPictures.

It will take a bit to write it because I'm starting a mathnproject this week and it will go for the next month or two and it'snmajor important. I will write when I don't have homework or I'llntry. It had been a few yearsnsince the showdown between Danny and Max. I know Max is still outnthere waiting for Danny probably waiting for his weakest moment, whonknows. Danny told his parentsneverything he created his own place far away. Too far for even, Maxnto find him. This may or may not change only the future knows. I am still in school. nIt is my senior year and I will be graduating in exactly a month. nThat doesn't matter though. Danny and I have beennin touch. What I never thought would happen, happened. DannynSinclair and I fell in love. After the show was the start, henpromised me what ever happened he would always be with me and that henwould never let anyone coughmaxcough ever get me. There were many secretndates. I would never let my mother or father know. They had thisnstrange rule about no dating until I'm 20 and I can't even go toncollege until I'm 25. I broke or am going to break both. A wind swept through mynroom viciously this was bad. Danny was going to get me soon I knewnit but he was upset. His magic told it all. I found myself in anstormy valley. I turned and saw Danny standing there. He flung hisnarms around me because he hadn't seen me for a month at least. \"Ally I missed you sonmuch I had to get you, you're in real danger now. Max is backnstronger than ever. He knows my weak spot...he knows it's you. Henwon't stop, you need to hide there is nothing else to do,\" Dannynchoked out, he was really upset. \"Danny...my parentsnwhat do I do?\" I said shakily. Lightning struck a tree near wear Inwas standing. A shriek was emitted from my mouth. Danny grabbed menand pulled me into a cave near by. \"It's too dangerousnto go out and I'm pretty sure Mad Max can watch whose traveling bynmagic, you'll have to stay unfortunately I took you from there at anbad time, there is no going back,\" Danny said. DANNY POV She never had had angreat relationship with her parents her dad was an alcoholic and hernmother spent her day working a day and a night shift at differentnjobs. All they did was set down ground rules and said if they werenbroken then she would be punished. For her that would be a beating. Somewhere deep insidenme I knew she was relieved. She would be safe from them here butnthis was like the saying 'Out of the frying pan and into the fire'nHer dad was the worst I had caught him beating her. FLASHBACK(Danny'snPOV) \" You. Where havenyou been you are supposed to go to school then come straight back. nLet's see you are, three hours late. Well where were you.\" Herndad yelled slapping her across the face then pushing her against thenwall. I couldn't getninto the house to stop him and my feet were glued to the floor and mynface to the window. It was unbearable to watch her suffer but therenwas nothing I could do. Shakily she said, \"Inwas studying over at Danny's house.\" She chose the wrong wordsnhe punched her which made her fall and then kicked her in the gut. n\"I told you not to talk to anyone unless we allowed it and this wasnnot allowed.\" He screamed at her. She nodded silently.n He pointed up the stares saying something I couldn't hear throughnthe glass. She scrambled up with all her energy and started climbingnthe stairs. A light flickered on by a balcony. I climbed up and sawnher crying in her bed. I knocked softly on the window. She lookednup and saw me she calmed down a little. I opened the door to hernbedroom. She walked over tonme and wrapped her arms around my neck. \"How much did you see?\"nshe whispered to me. \"Enough,\" I whispered. END OF FLASHBACK The storm was ragingnoutside and it was getting worse. This wasn't just a normal stormnsomeone a.k.a. Max made it. The cave was sheltered and slightly warm.n I lit a fire. \"Danny are you strongnenough to fight him. Can we win?\" Allyson asked scared I shrugged for I didn'tnknow. It was all to overwhelming. Okay press thenlittle cute review button because I need reviews .[Chapter 2] Thanks for thenreviews they are very helpful. I don't own anything except a catnnamed Saunga and a hamster named Hershey-Amelia-Shea-Boris (off topicnI know) It had been a week innhiding and I was getting anxious Allyson and I had gone back to hernhouse yesterday just to find it deserted and ransacked. It was anterrible sight because Max had written his name in burnt lettersnacross the wall. Her parents werenmissing but Ally didn't cry she held strong. I didn't knownsomeone so beautiful and fragile could ever stand this but Allysonnwas different. We left and just walkednand walked around town. \"Allyson what are you doing here? Danny?\"nMs. McCallister asked stepping out from some bakery, \"I haven'tnseen you for a while and Danny where have you been you've beennmissing since the finale?\" \"No where Ms.nMcCallister Allyson and I are just out on...an evening stroll,\" Insaid quickly trying to find a way out of this conversation. Shennodded walked the other way; then turned back to us. \"Danny, Allyson Maxnis looking for you he said give this to you if I found you,\" shensaid handing them a note. Allyson took it reluctantly and startednwalking over to a park bench. She opened the not andnit read: DANNY, ALLYSON there is no way to say th I s nicely but cedric W asnaccepted I nto Fi L ming Co L lege. F ornstarters th I s is N ot a ba D thing. Y ounsh OU ld be happy for him ! I K i N dly ask O fnyou to W rite back soon WHERE ever YOU ARE! I didn't get it atnfirst but when Allyson started freaking out I knew something was upnwith the letter. \"Danny we have to gonsomewhere look, the note every where a letter is capitalized and boldnits part of a message. Read it!\" Allyson nearly screamed at me. Inlooked at it again and I paled majorly. This was bad very bad. I grabbed Ally's handnand ran out of the park. Ally's safety was even more important nownif Max knew where we were. Where could we hide there was no where tongo that Max wouldn't find us. I finally realizednsomething. No matter where I went what I did, I was putting someonenin danger. Allyson had already lost her home and family she didn'tnhave anything. I was on the run constantly and for what...nothing. Inneeded to face Max sometime or another. I turned another cornernonly to knock down an old man. Ally shrieked. I turned. There henwas, Max, holding Allyson with his hands around her neck. O godnno please no. \"One move closer andnAllyson is gone think of that Danny before you fight. I've got onenthing that can't be replaced the one thing you would give your lifenfor, your true love. Allyson was what you were looking for, I knewnfrom the start. She would have what you want a loyal friend whonknows the real you. It's to late alliances can't be changed. nMost of all this is the end you will be gone and I will have enoughnpower to control everything!!!\" Max's ranting turned to shoutingnin the end. ALLYSONS POV Danny stayed in place. nI knew him well enough that he was thinking of a way to get out ofnthis. \"What do you want Max,\" Danny asked shakily watching menclosely. Max laughed evilly. \"Danny, Danny, Danny,n you are still no match for me and I will get what I want, it wouldntake the power of two of you to destroy me. I want and will get yournmagic whether you want me to or not,\" Max said slowly. Anger was boilingninside of Danny I could always sense his feelings but this was thenstrongest time I had ever felt him in my. Danny disappeared. Max held me evenntighter waiting for a surprise attack. I couldn't escape his grip. \" Allyson Allysonnlisten its me Danny I put myself in your body. He can't get menhere and he won't hurt you as long as he could still use you to getnme so just pretend you don't know where I am\" Danny whisperednin my head. \"Brat, he doesn'tncare for you see he left you your just a worthless piece of trash,\"nMax said pushing me to the floor. He kicked me continuously but Infelt no pain at all. Danny must be helping. \"Allyson I will leavenyou this time but remember you aren't safe any more Danny isn'tnhere to protect you,\" Max disappeared. He knows I'm innyou Ally that's the only reason he left you, he's planningnsomething bigger I just know it. Right now just get somewhere with anlot of people and I mean a lot. I went walking aroundntown and ended up at a dance club I never was one for dancing orndrinking or scuba diving (a/n jk) but it was always the most crowdednspot in town. As I walked into thenclub a person materialized besides me. \"Allyson you just had tonpick a club didn't you?\" Danny laughed. I nodded and pulled himnonto the dance floor. We stayed for a while and everything was goingnall right until...Hunter. A very drunk Hunternwalked dizzily towards me and Danny. \"Allyson whatre youdoinnhere,\" Hunter said getting even closer to me. Danny pulled me backnHunter wasn't very lets just say nice. \"I uh see you broughtnDanny ally dance with me thatsunot asugestion thatsan orduh,\" nHunter said pulling me away from Danny. I tried to get away butnHunter was to strong. Danny was heading my way and he was upset. I was snatched awaynfrom Hunter and pulled to the other side of the structure into a safencorner. \"Allyson he has spies everywhere we need to go somewherenelse,\" Danny said sitting next to me. I nodded knowingly, henwas right. I started walking towards the door and Danny followed. nHow much worse could this day get… I know its kindanweird and kinda a stupid Chappie but I still updated. I had majornlike scheduling errors this past week. Around 4 hours of homeworknevery night. My birthday was yesterday and I still have to clean up anbit but o well. Please review.[Chapter 3] Okay im sorry aboutneverything the not updating I know you don't want to hear mynexcuses but im still gonna say them I had a 5 page report on StevenIrwin for English, in reading we have been reading Anne Frank and Inhave to catch up on notes for a third of the book(yes during winternbreak), i've been trying to catch up on my friends (they desertednme for a while) yes theres more if any of you have any tips on NOTnbeing a know it all or on getting your old best friend/boyfriendn(from kindergarten) to believe his girlfriend is a twofaced devilngirl. That's all! I walked through anflower filled garden perfect with marble white pillars and a lightnsnowfall. The flowers a nice shade of blue were still blooming innthe morning light. A pond in the middle of the garden frozen overnfrom the nights snow was before me. I twirled around in my dare Inthink beautiful dress. It was a light teal blue with the perfectnlength (there's a link in my profile check it out). The flowers hadnall bloomed now and the sun had risen my secret garden was even morenbeautiful. Though the warm sun's rays beat down upon the snow itnstayed cold. The air warm and lightly scented of honey felt goodnagainst my skin . Yes this place, my place could never be changed nonmatter how much war and hate in the world it was the one thing I hadnthat would always be mine. I woke up from thendream aware of my surroundings I was in a small cabin by a lake. nDanny had transported us there last night. It may have been andangerous move but we needed somewhere to go. I have been havingnthis dream ever since I was little; when the teasing started. Thisnwas my sanctuary where no one ever was to ruin it. Danny was thenonly other person on Earth who knew of these dreams. It was morenreal than dream but yet not completely physical. Oh how I wished tonreally be there. I guess Danny didn'tnknow everything about me he knew a lot though. He knew from when Inwas ten till now today was the day I would tell him everything elsenthat is what I decided. \"Danny wake up,nDanny,\" I shook him lightly on the shoulder. He got up and rubbednhis eyes. \"Hmm, what's the matter Allyson?\" He asked sleepily. nI looked at my watch. \"It's time to get up it's almostneleven,\" I nearly shouted. He stepped outnof his bed and went towards the front porch, his favorite place. Insat down next to him on the swing. \"Danny um I want you to knownwhat happened to me when I was little it was a lot more then I everntold you,\" I whispered to him. He nodded and I started to recallneverything from the beginning. \"When I was three mynmom and dad still loved me and cared for me. My mom thought I wasnbeautiful so she entered me in a pageant she said I was destined tonwin. I messed up and forgot the words to my song in the talentnportion. I didn't win and she got mad because she had spent over 3nthousand dollars on me. She went and punched the girls mom and thennshe kicked the girl knocking out her teeth. As soon as I got home itnwas torture, her and my dad broke my and my leg it was terrible \"Then as soon asnmy arm and leg healed it was worse, I couldn't go outside Incouldn't have friends and I would only get one meal a day. Then myndad got drunk more than ever he was throwing bottles everywhere andnthen he called for me I was almost five then but he threw his beernand me and made me watch my own blood drip down my cuts it hurt likenhell and I wanted to leave but if I tried he would point a knife atnme and say STAY \" By the time Inwas seven mom was gone almost always and one night she came homenearly dad didn't know that she had been pregnant and had the babynalready she was that much but when he saw that little girl, littlenCeleste, he went nuts I saw everything. He yelled at her andnslapped her making her confess to the fling. Finally he pulled a gunnand shot Celeste he said if it wasn't his kid he wouldn't raisenit. I saw the tears running down moms faces she wasn't the samensince. I had a sister for a week then she was gone. \" Worst of allnwhen I turned nine dad was really drunk the worst he had ever hadneven worse than when I was little. I had just had a giant growthnspurt so even my longest shirts were showing my stomach. My dad sawnthis and he...he well he got even more drunk and tried to get mendrunk I wouldn't drink anything though. He tried tonum...kinda...well rape me that night he didn't though.\" Infinished. Danny was speechlessnand by the look of it thinking hard. He shook his head. \"AllysonnI didn't know,\" he said. DANNY POV I didn't know thingsncould be so messed up, why did this one girl have to suffer so much. nThat wasn't cool I saw tears trickling down her face. I reachednover and wiped them off. An urge over came me I leaned down andnkissed her. We had always said we were in love but we had nevernkissed or actually said the words. She looked upnsmiling and kissed me again. By this time of day the sun was settingn(a/n she talked a lot just I didn't put it all in) Allyson hadnstarted falling asleep her head on my shoulder. I picked her up andncarried her over to her bed. I tucked her in and I heard her whispernsomething strangely sounding like 'I love you' I shook it off. I fell asleep tonthe sounds of Ally's soft breathing. Out of nowhere and even thoughnshe couldn't hear it I said \"I love you Allyson\" Better than lastnchapter but not exactly 5 star maybe a 3 ½ or a 4.

Alyson and Danny have no idea how similar they are… ------------------------------------- \"I know how it feels to be an outcast, Danny! Okay? I might act as if I have all the friends in the world, but I don't! My life isn't exactly perfect, you know!\" Alyson had lost it. Danny seemed to think that she just wanted to get to know him because he could win her the competition, but that wasn't the story. \"Well at least you're not a freak like me!\" Danny retorted. Alyson blinked. \"You're not a freak.\" She said softly. \"Yes, I am.\" And he walked into his room, turned around, and slammed the door in Alyson's face. And that was when she began to cry. ---------------------------------- Cedric found her in the secret room. \"Alyson? What - Why are you crying?\" he asked. \"Danny's mad at me. And I don't know why.\" She said, wiping off her tear-stained face. \"Could you expand on that?\" \"We were arguing, and it somehow turned to him being a - a freak. He said it, not me.\" Alyson said hurriedly when Cedric opened his mouth. \"I told him he wasn't, and he said he was, then slammed his door in my face.\" She burst into tears again. Cedric didn't know what to say. ---------------------------------- Danny heard a knock on his door. \"Go away Alyson!\" He yelled, hurriedly wiping his tears away. \"It's not Alyson.\" Said a soft voice. \"It's Zoey.\" \"Did you need something?\" he opened his door. \"I kinda saw your argument with Alyson. After you slammed the door, she started crying, then left.\" He closed his eyes and nodded. \"This is all my fault.\" He closed his door behind him. \"Follow me.\" he said. ---------------------------------- Danny knew exactly where Alyson would be, but he didn't expect Cedric to be there too. They were talking, and hadn't seemed to hear him and Zoey come in. She looked around, amazed. \"I thought you were claustrophobic, Cedric.\" He said. Alyson and Cedric turned toward him. When she saw who it was, she got up, not making eye contact with Danny, and walked to the thing they use to leave. \"Wait.\" Danny grabbed her arm before she could turn it. \"Okay!\" Alyson threw her arms out and slumped into a chair. \"Explain to me why you're a freak, and saying you aren't deserves a door being slammed in my face!\" Danny told her everything. About the skateboard, about the bully in the tree, about his constant fear of his magic. Zoey, Cedric, and Alyson sat, listening intently. \"At least you have ways of getting rid of a bully.\" Alyson said. \"All my life, I've been laughed at for not being interested in clothes and hair and boys. But mostly, for acting like a know-it-all. I don't mean to. It's just…I don't know…people have a hard time accepting people who are smarter than them.\" He simply nodded understandingly. --------------------------------------------- A/N: Okay, so it's short, but it's probably one of my most descriptive stories ever! So far… This is like the best movie ever! Along with some others, but it has Aly Michalka AND Johnny Pacar! I mean, come on, are they not some of the best? I love reviews! (Hint hint) Piano-Rox-101[Chapter 2] Now You See It… - Do You Believe In Magic? Chapter 2 - The Council (Let's just pretend the meeting was AFTER the argument….) ----------------------------------- Before they knew it, it was time for Danny to go see the expert council. He, Alyson, Cedric, and Zoey walked to the stage room. Brandon and Hunter were already there, and when they saw Danny they burst out laughing. \"Ignore them Danny.\" Alyson said, and brushed past Brandon, glaring at him. Max gestured at Danny to come on the stage. He glanced back at Alyson worriedly before sitting down. Max introduced the council, and they asked questions, Danny answered them, then they asked him to show them his powers. Danny floated in the chair, then Max pushed him down. Alyson jumped up. \"What are you doing?\" She and Danny said in unison. Max explained about the chair. \"I'm not lying!\" Danny protested. \"He's telling the truth!\" Alyson cried. \"You may sit down now, Alyson.\" Max said. She glared at Brandon and Hunter, who were snickering, and sat down. \"Now, as you can tell, Danny is just striving for attention, we are done here.\" Max addressed the council, and they began to leave. Alyson walked up to Danny. \"It's okay, it doesn't matter.\" She said. Max walked up. \"Danny, if I could have a word in an hour?\" he asked. Danny nodded suspiciously. \"And Alyson, I would prefer if you stayed…out of the way during our conversation.\" Max said. She opened her mouth to respond, but Danny stepped on her foot. \"Goodbye!\" Max left. \"Ow!\" She said. \"We'll find a way to make you be there.\" Danny said. --------------------------------------------- Now that Zoey was in on the secret, she accompanied Alyson and Cedric to the spying grate. \"Why are we here again?\" Cedric asked. \"I need you to tape this! Now shh!\" Alyson waved her hand at him to be quiet. They saw and heard Max talk to Danny about his powers, and watched them 'battle'. Then he pulled out the ring and had Danny put it on. Danny left, and Cedric went to turn off the camera. \"Not yet!\" Alyson whispered. Cedric rolled his eyes and aimed the camera into the grate again. Max discussed with Paul about taking Danny's powers, then they left. \"We've gotta tell Danny!\" Alyson rushed out of the room, and Cedric and Zoey ran to keep up. --------------------------------------------- \"Danny! Danny open up, we have to talk to you!\" Alyson rapped on the door. \"Shouldn't you three be in bed?\" They whirled around to see Paul. \"Uh, well, yeah, you see…\" They all stuttered. Danny opened the door. \"Yeah?\" he said. \"Um, we just, wanted to say…goodnight!\" Zoey smiled enthusiastically, but you could tell it was fake. \"Goodnight then…\" Danny said. Alyson and Cedric smiled as well. Paul looked at them suspiciously. \"Well, we're off to bed!\" Cedric said. \"Meet me in the secret room before breakfast.\" Alyson whispered to Danny hurriedly, then hurried off with Cedric and Zoey, repeating the message to them before closing her door and drifting off to sleep. -------------------------------------- (Alyson's bedroom POV) \"So your probably wondering, what's Max up too? Is he plotting to steal Danny's magic? Well, you have NO idea. We were in for more than we bargained for.\" -------------------------------------- (Regular POV) Danny entered the secret room to find Alyson already there. \"Cedric had to clean his lens or something, and Zoey's producer wanted to talk to her about the finale.\" Alyson shut the book she was reading. \"Anyways, you have to take off the ring.\" She said. \"Why? I've never been happier.\" Danny smiled. \"Exactly! Max is trying to steal your magic!\" \"How do you know?\" Danny said. \"He said so after you left! I have proof!\" Alyson dashed for her room. -------------------------------------- They ran into the camera room, Cedric and Zoey following. \"Max is evil, he's trying to steal Danny's magic!\" Alyson told Mrs. McCalister. When she looked at Alyson strangely, Alyson held up the tape. \"I have proof!\" \"Why don't we see this proof?\" Max said, and reached for it. Alyson jerked her hand back. \"I'll put it in!\" She pushed the tape into the slot, and pressed play. The screen showed a cartoon mouse doing the hokey-pokey. Mrs. McCalister tried not to laugh. \"He-he jinxed it! Or…something!\" Alyson said. The decision was soon made - Alyson was too stressed, so she had to go home. \"No! Don't make me leave! I'm telling the truth!\" She stared dumbfounded at Danny. \"Tell them!\" He shrugged apologetically. She shook her head and left, storming down the hall to her room. Danny ran after her. \"Alyson-\" \"Save it.\" It sounded like she was crying. -------------------------------------- Alyson stuffed her belongings into her suitcase angrily, then headed for the entrance. She walked through the practice room, not making eye contact with anyone. A hand grabbed her arm and whirled her around. \"Alyson, I didn't mean-\" \"You could have said something! You just another person trying to make me look like a fool, and I'm not gonna sit around and be made fun of.\" With that, she turned around and stormed out the door. -------------------------------------- She was glad nobody paid attention to her on the train, because she cried for a while. Then she got off at the computer café stop, to research the last puzzle. She typed the Antonio DeMilo website into the search bar, and the page came up. She skimmed through it, then she saw the picture. Her eyes widened, and she clicked print, then hurried to the printer. -------------------------------------- (Bedroom POV) \"I had to tell Danny about the ring. I couldn't let him get hurt! You wouldn't believe how close to that it came.\" -------------------------------------- A/N: Hello? Is anyone beside dinolove453 reading this? I have ONE review. I'm not posting until I get three reviews! And I mean it! Piano-Rox-101[Chapter 3] Now You See It… - Do You Believe In Magic? Chapter 3 - Finales Are Always Disasters (Part 1) ------------------------------------- Alyson ran up the step to the Magic Mansion. She quietly opened the door and looked around. No one was in the lobby, they were all in the stage room. She quickly shoved her bags into a broom closet and went to find Danny. She hid behind a curtain and watched Zoey go on stage. Brandon was wailing about wardrobe malfunctions, and Danny was in a corner talking with Max. After Zoey came back, Max left to introduce Brandon, who had calmed down. Alyson crept up behind Danny and tugged his sleeve. \"Alyson? What are you-\" \"Shh! I have to tell you something!\" She whispered and pulled him farther away from the group. \"You're in horrible danger.\" She held up the picture. He blinked. \"Wow, a picture. That put my life in danger, huh?\" \"No, look! He's wearing the ring Max gave you. It's Antonio DeMilo. He died in an onstage accident while wearing that ring!\" Danny looked at her expectantly. \"So?\" \"So, you have to let me take it off!\" Alyson said frustratedly. \"No! You don't know how good it feels!\" He replied. \"Well how good is it gonna feel when your skull is crushed!\" Alyson whisper-yelled. \"I don't even know why I'm trying to help you!\" \"Well neither do I!\" Danny said. Max began to introduce Danny. \"I have to go.\" \"Fine! Don't listen to me! You're making a big mistake Danny!\" Alyson called after him. She ran after him and crouched on the sidelines behind the curtains. Danny explained his trick, and the weight began to float. Alyson glanced at Max as he flicked his finger. The weight began to fall. \"Danny!\" Alyson screamed, and ran onto the stage. She pushed him out of the way, falling to the floor in the process. When she looked up, the weight was hurtling towards her. -------------------------------------- A/N: Ha! Maybe you'll review now, if you ever want to hear what happens! Piano-Rox-101[Chapter 4] Do You Believe In Magic? Chapter 4 - Finales Are Always Disasters (Part 2) -------------------------------------- Danny's eyes widened. \"No!\" He whispered, too stunned to yell. Alyson's heart beat furiously. She was about to scream, when the weight stopped, and hovered in the air. Danny had his hand out, as if commanding it to stop. He looked around, not knowing what had happened. Then he rushed forward and helped Alyson scramble backwards just before the weight crashed into the ground. \"I told you!\" She said quietly. Before he could say anything, Alyson vanished from his arms. He looked around wildly. Danny heard a thumping behind him, and turned around to see Max standing next to the box you stick swords in. \"No… Alyson was right about you!\" He cried. \"And you can't overpower me!\" Danny tried to take the ring off. No matter how hard he tugged, it wouldn't come off. He began to panic. \"Let Alyson out!\" \"I think we'll have a little fun first.\" Max smiled evilly and stuck a sword into the box. Danny heard Alyson scream. He and Max had both forgotten the audience. Danny ran up to the box and opened the door. Alyson had vanished. Again. \"Where is she Max?\" he said threateningly. \"That's for me to know,\" he shut the door. \"And for you to find out!\" He shoved another sword in and opened the door. Alyson was inside, unhurt, but cut off by the swords. \"Let my daughter go!\" A lady from the audience yelled. \"Yeah, let her out!\" Danny's dad said. Even Hunter nodded, a frightened look on his face. While Max tried to quiet the crowd, Danny took the opportunity to push him out of the way and pull the swords out of the box. Alyson stepped out and threw her arms around Danny, crying. \"Touching.\" Max said. Alyson let go of Danny, even though she was shaking violently. \"Let me take the ring off.\" She said. Danny held out his hand. \"No!\" Max said. Alyson slipped the ring off and handed it to Danny. They turned to Max, and Danny threw the ring at him. It disappeared, then appeared on Max's finger. \"Look who's in control now!\" Danny said. Alyson smiled at Max innocently. Suddenly, they heard applause. They turned around and saw the crowd cheering. Hunter was sitting and clapping grudgingly. Brandon, who was right next to him, winked at them. \"Um, ta-da!\" Alyson curtsied quickly, and Danny waved. The crowd quieted as Mrs. McCalister walked onto the stage. \"I'm sure all of you enjoyed the finale, now, we are going to have YOU pick the winner.\" The crowd buzzed. \"Family and friends, I encourage you to vote for who you think was the best, not your family. Now, all hands for Brandon?\" A couple of people raised their hands, including Hunter. \"Zoey?\" There were a few more hands in the air for Zoey than Brandon. \"And, last but certainly not least, Danny?\" More than half the audience's hand flew into the air. Alyson's hand shot up in the air as well. \"Well, I think we've found our winner!\" \"I knew you could do it!\" Alyson smiled. Danny nodded and laughed. \"What?\" Alyson said. \"Look at Hunter!\" Danny laughed. Hunter was arguing with Mrs. McCalister. He looked furious. \"He's madder than Brandon!\" She said. \"I'm not mad at all!\" Brandon's voice came from behind them. \"You really deserved it. Congrats, dude.\" \"You did really good too!\" Danny replied. \"Come on, saving Alyson? That's way better than playing with a little light.\" \"He's right, you know!\" Zoey joined their conversation. Soon they left. \"You seem quieter than usual.\" Danny said to Alyson. She thought for a second. \"I just wanted to say…thanks for saving my life, twice.\" \"Thanks for being the only person who's ever cared.\" He replied. Their eyes met. He leaned forward. And they kissed. They heard clapping and broke apart. They turned to see Zoey, Brandon, and Cedric clapping and smiling. \"Took you long enough!\" Zoey said. Alyson and Danny just smiled. ------------------------------------------------ After everything calmed down, everyone rushed off to get dressed for the wrap-up party. They all met back up in an hour. Zoey, Brandon, and Danny all took turns performing their tricks. \"What did you do to him, Alyson?\" Cedric asked her. They were watching Danny, who was smiling. He hadn't stopped since him and Alyson had kissed. \"I cast a spell!\" She held up her hands and wiggled her fingers playfully. A while later, Mrs. McCalister walked onto the stage and took the mike off it's stand. \"Now, I'm sure you've all had fun, and now it's time for the awards ceremony. First, I'd like to welcome up Brandon.\" He walked on stage and waved at the camera. \"Now Brandon, you may have come in third, but that doesn't mean you aren't an amazingly talented magician.\" She handed him a bronze trophy and a wrapped package. \"Here is your trophy and a little gift to remember us by.\" She smiled. Brandon walked off the stage and sat down at a table with Hunter. \"Now, don't open that until everyone gets theirs!\" Mrs. McCalister said. \"Now, Zoey.\" Zoey skipped up. \"You are a ray of sunshine, and deserve this second place trophy.\" She handed her the trophy and present. Zoey sat back down. \"Now, I'd like you all to give a big hand for our winner, Danny!\" Danny walked up to the stage. \"You started off with a shaky start, but pulled off a win in the end, and for that, I think we are all amazed.\" She handed him his trophy and present. \"And now, if I could have Alyson on stage as well?\" She beckoned for Alyson to come up. Alyson walked up, confused. \"I'd like to inform you two that you will return for a second season of Search For the Greatest Kid Magician!\" She said. Alyson and Danny gaped surprisedly. \"We're really coming back?\" Alyson said. Mrs. McCalister nodded. Alyson and Danny smiled wider than physically possible. \"Now, each of our producers will return, and two knew producers will be chosen by the old producers. All except Alyson will pick new magicians. As for Zoey and Brandon, you will be able to stay at the Mansion and help the new magicians, and watch their performances.\" Everyone began talking excitedly. \" I'll let you get back to the party! You may open your presents now!\" Danny and Alyson sat back down, and he tore off the paper. Inside was the wand from the second challenge. Zoey gasped when she opened hers, and Brandon said \"cool!\" Alyson turned back to Danny. \"So, got any tricks planned?\" \"Maybe…\" He flicked the wand, and a bouquet of flowers appeared in her hand. THE END ------------------------------------------ A/N: Well, I hope all of you liked my story. I will be writing a sequel, so no worries about the unknown. I know it was kinda short, but I've got a bunch of stories I need to finish before I can write anything else, so you might not see the sequel for a while.

Hope you like it. Side note: Aithne is a Celtic name that I have always adored and it means 'little fire.' Little Fire \"Arab!\" A familiar voice called out. Ahmed whirled around, to be greeted by a beaming little girl. She held her arms out in welcome. \"Aithne!\" He closed his arms around her in a warm hug. His black folds of fabric fluttered over them in the freezing air. He pulled back and studied her. \"You have grown!\" His Norse had a thick middle-eastern accent. Aithne rolled her eyes with a chuckle. \"You have only been gone since the last full moon.\" Her long lashes made shadows on her pale cheeks. Her extremely light blonde hair was pulled back in a long braid. \"It has been too long, nonetheless.\" He laughed as his crow's feet gathered in the dark skin around his eyes. Her brows furrowed as she smiled. Ahmed could not help, but to notice how much she reminded him of her father. \"You have your father's eyes.\" The Arab said softly. He can see her father now, in his mind, the large figure of a heroic king sitting on his impromptu final throne, soaked, pale, and cold. Dead. \"You tell me this often, Arab.\" The small child's voice pulled him out of his thoughts. He blinked at how she squinted her eyes and grinned with mischievous intent. \"What are you thinking, little one?\" Ahmed asked as he arched a brow. She pulled away and studied him with her piercing blue eyes, just as her father had. The memory of that day that he had learned of her reeled in his head. Herger had paced his horse next to Ahmed's stallion, or \"dog\" as they had put it. The north man on the enormous steed had rambled about his family and the others' families, too. Ahmed had finally managed to ask about the leader, Buliwfy. Herger's only reply was that the king had one daughter of three winters and nothing more. \"I want you to teach me how to use a sword.\" The bluntness of the child's words yet again pulled him out of his thoughts. He stared at her, puzzled for a moment. \"But you are young, child. A girl, as well, and that is the least of my worries. Little girls should not learn how to use such things.\" He uttered in a strange mixture of confusion and shock with a hint of fatherly pride. Aithne's jaw jutted out in the signature sign of persistence that she and her father shared. Ahmed had seen Buliwfy do that many times in their short friendship. Her icy eyes flashed defiance as she squared up with him in the way a warrior of her people would. She clamped her tiny fists on her hips and glared at him. \"Just because I am a girl? You know that I can handle it. You have seen how I can beat other boys of the village in matches, Ahmed.\" Her tone was stubborn and Ahmed knew that as she had actually called him by his name, she was serious. He hid a smile. The thought of her being full-grown and still picking fights with the men of this area made him snicker. It won't be long till she would outgrow him. He tilted his head and tried his best imposing fatherly stance at her, but it didn't phase her one bit. The image of Buliwfy crept into his mind. The warrior was ashen and death was coming over him fast. He had leaned against him and asked the smaller man to take care of his little girl, the fire that kept him going. The Arab shook his head to stop the scene in his brain. He shrugged with a defeated sigh. \"Fine, but first your reading and writing lesson.\" He motioned to the mud at their feet. She nodded in understanding. Her blonde braid bounced around and she smiled in triumph in the exact manner that Buliwfy would have. She moved to her left and knelt. Her tiny finger dug shallowly in the muck and began to gracefully trace lines. \"There is only one God, and Mohammad is his…\" She spoke, but faltered at the end. Uncertainty was clearly on her mind. The short man squatted next to her with a crooked grin. The girl of ten winters narrowed her eyes on his fingers as he corrected the symbol in the wet dirt. \"Prophet.\" He stared down into her intelligent eyes when she nodded. \"Now let us begin!\" He stood up and reached for the hilt of his sword. In one motion he pulled it out and slowly tossed it to the child. She caught it awkwardly as she stood up. Aithne crinkled up her nose in distaste. \"I cannot lift this.\" She complained. Her knees buckled to help her balance as she heaved the heavy weapon onto her shoulder. She fumbled a little with the blade. In the back of Ahmed's mind he could see his old friend with a great smile of pride of his daughter on his face, a smile for his little fire. Ahmed spoke once more. \"Grow stronger.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Not so little. The clash of swords rang throughout the frozen forest. The icy wind stirred the bristles of the swaying trees. \"Good! Now don't forget your stance!\" Ahamed instructed. He swung to his opponent's torso, but only to have weapon to glance off another. \"I have never forgotten!\" The blonde laughed as she spun against to his direction. Ahamed froze at the sensation of cold metal against the back of his neck. He dropped his blade with a grin. His long gray shirt was pressed onto by his leather practice armor aw were his forest green plants. His thick fur lined brown coat served him well with the freezing gusts of wind. He smiled as saw how similar she fought like her father, but the monks from the east have taught her the art of their strange fighting. \"Good. Good. You are now beating this old man.\" He looked over his shoulder to see a sword resting on his skin from an extended arm in the style of how he was once taught from his master in his homeland. The arm bound in fabric and leather was attached to a tall girl with a triumphant smirk. Amused. he wrinkled up his red nose at he sight. \"I have had a great teacher… and father.\" Aithne removed her weapon from her master and twirled it into its sheath. The Arab tilted his head with a sigh. He faced her and cupped the pale face. \"My, you have grown. You make this man feel old.\" He studied the crisp blue eyes with fond memories. \"Are you sure that is me that makes you feel old or is it your aching joints?\" She raised her brow with a mischievous grin. He chuckled and pulled his adopted daughter into his embrace. \"That too.\" He pulled back and patted her shoulder that was protected with rough leather and pelts. The older man reached down and picked up his light sword and covered it. \"Come. Your mother will be worried sick if we are late yet again.\" He tugged on a flowing stand of her hair just as he did when she was a child. She gave an annoyed huff and batted away his hand. \"Very well, but she won't be happy about you still training me.\" \"When has that stopped us?\" The Arab looked up at the slightly taller girl with a mischievous grin. Aithne let out a hearty laugh. Her light armor was strapped over her navy blue long sleeved tunic. Her leg guards were placed over her earthy toned pants and knee high boots. Gray fur was draped over her shoulders for warmth. \"Let us hurry. Mother has made an effort to make your peculiar favorite food.\" Aithne sniffed the air. \"She has forgotten the garlic again.\" \"You will tell her that! Not I!\" Ahamed snickered with gusto. \"Do you wish for me to die?\" The young woman waved her gloved hands in the air dramatically. The pair laughed and continued to follow the scent. \"Where have you been?\" A fire haired woman bellowed as the entered the large hall. The air was heavy with the scent of poorly cooked shawarma. \"Uh… we went for a walk.\" Ahamed shrugged. Aithne flashed him a thin smile that her father has shown him once. \"Do not lie to me Arab!\" She waved her fingers at him in warning. He red loose curls bounced. \"We were training.\" The young girl said plainly. The dark man stole a terrified glance at her. The mother's face nearly matched her hair. \"You are a woman! Not some sort of warrior!\" The angered woman stood on her toes to match her daughter's eyes, but to no avail. She is exactly the height of the Arab, but her skin is nearly completely blanched color except for her freckles. Her mint green dress swished around her ankles. \"Alfdis…\" The dark man warned. He knew that Aithne's personality and her mother's, Alfdis clashed often. The blonde woman's face became serious and angry. \"Single minded as always.\" Aithne glared. \"What did you say?\" Alfdis dared. Aithne's face instantly turned into a coy one. \"You have forgotten the garlic.\" At her daughter's words Alfdis laughed. \"I can not change your mind.\" The mother patted her only child's face. \"Or un-burn food.\" The blonde nodded to the crackling slices of spicy chicken. The red head gasped and moved the food onto a plate. \"Oh my Odin! That was close. Ahamed, I fear that I will never be able to cook your people's food.\" She motioned for the other maidens to help wrap the cooked meat into the flat breads. The women rushed and did their work. \"Now go to your quarters. I will not have you dining with you two clad in sparring gear.\" The busy mother waved them off. The pair laughed, but Ahamed noticed once again how much Aithne was similar to her father. Her hair color is the same, as well as her mannerisms. How she smiles, laughs, and fights. \"Hurry. We do not want to feast on cold shawarma.\" The Arab ushered her to her door. She opened her door and glanced at him. \"I know what you are thinking old man.\" She gave a sad smile. \"Best not to dwell on old memories.\" She disappeared behind the wood planks of the door. The older man sighed. \"It is easier said than done.\" ","Summary":" This takes place about seven years after his death. Hope you like it.

I just love it passionately. I got this idea randomly and I want to see what people think of it. I hope you like it. I only own my three OCs for right now. There might be others later on. Author's Note: I'm not sure who all dies so this is the list of who is alive of the warriors: Ibn, Edgtho, Herger, and Weath.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own 13 th Warrior (book or movie). I own Eyldis, Rowan and Saldís. Eyldis swept her hair off her shoulder and surveyed her domain. The room was as clean as it could get. There wasn't much more that she could do for it or to it for that matter short of rearranging the furniture which she had already done twice. She was terrified, but she could not allow it to show. He was coming. He was actually coming. She had never thought it possible. Why was he coming?! Had Weath and Herger kidnapped him? Had they bribed him? Did they know some terrible secret that they were using against him. Surely he had not come of his own free will. If that was true, then she could hate him. She didn't know what she would do if she couldn't hate him. Eyldis paced the room wringing her hands and waiting for the party to be announced. What did he look like? Would he want to take the girls back to his homeland? What would he say of her? She had been dreading this day for the past year. Now it was here. She hated that thought. That this one man could make her fret so desperately. Saldís stole into the room and touched her aunt as the woman paced the room furiously. Eyldis stopped abruptly when she felt the little hand brush her skirt. She looked down at her blonde niece and swept the girl up in her arms. \"What is wrong Mama Eyldis? Did Rowan and I do something wrong?\" The girl's big dark brown eyes looked up at her imploringly. Eyldis stroked the girl's blonde curls. \"No my darling, you and your sister have been very good. I've just been thinking too much.\" Eyldis hugged Saldís close and kissed the girl's mop of hair. \"Where did your sister run off to little sun?\" \"She went to play with Alf and Idonea near the wall,\" Saldís replied leaning her head against Eyldis's shoulder. Eyldis nodded absently. \"Yes, that's well.\" The call announcing the arrival of a large group made Eyldis jump and her heart slam against her chest. \"Freya protect us…he's here…\" \"Who Mama Eyldis?\" Saldís whispered desperately. \"Who's here?\" \"Your father…\" \"You've done well by this place,\" Ibn said with a nod. \"It looks much better than when we had time for even the temporary fortifications.\" \"Yes well, for some reason people live here,\" Herger said with a laugh. \"Come now little brother, we're almost to Eyldis's home now.\" \"You old women are back?\" The speaker was a small girl with vibrant red hair, smears of dirt on her face and hair and her hands on her hips. \"Hello to you too little one,\" Weath said brightly. \"Why aren't you with your sister and your aunt?\" \"I've no need to tell you dog,\" the girl growled. \"Aye, but you'd tell your father,\" Herger pointed out. The girl's eyes were dark and dead. \"I have no father.\" \"Then what do you call our little brother?\" Herger asked. \"Ibn, meet your fiery daughter Rowan. Rowan, this is your father.\" Rowan glared at Ibn with all the hate a six-year-old could muster which was apparently quite a bit from the look on her face. \"You're no father of mine,\" she told him flatly. \"A father does not abandon his family. You're nothing but a maggot, a woman, and a bastard.\" \"Watch your tongue!\" Herger and Weath both snapped at the girl angrily. \"I'll not,\" the girl snapped before turning on her heel and walking away. \"That…that child is mine?\" Ibn asked his two friends in disbelief. Herger sighed. \"Aye, that she is little brother. Rowan is fierce for one so young isn't she? Saldís is much sweeter. Gods know how she came by that.\" \"I shall have to set Rowan right. Have none of the men offered for Eyldis? Did none offer for Olga for that matter?\" \"Of course they do!\" Herger exclaimed drawing little attention. \"Eyldis turns them down just as Olga did. These women are impossible I tell you.\" Weath shrugged. \"They are not impossible , merely trying to lead us all on a merry chase. I think you should have more faith in our little brother Herger.\" \"We shall see if you say the same after they've met.\" Herger muttered darkly. \"I think I would like to decide for myself,\" Ibn interjected softly. \"She is, after all, my responsibility now is she not.\" Weath and Herger laughed. \"If you can handle her,\" Weath told him. The hut that Weath and Herger led Ibn to made annoyance rise inside of him. Thinking back on the luxury that he had lived in in his own city, Ibn became sickened with not only the condition that his children lived in, but what he had lived in. How could he have knowingly lived in such decadence all these years. \"This is where they have been made to live,\" Ibn hissed angrily. \"You overestimate our ability when it comes to dealing with Eyldis. She doesn't even believe that you will come. We told you that already. Do you honestly think she would allow anyone to help her raising your daughters? That girl doesn't have the sense the gods gave a dog I tell you.\" \"Then I am a less than a dog now Herger?\" The young woman who growled at the warrior for the door was beautiful. Her hair was long and full of curls and waves as her sisters had been, but her hair was not the gold her sisters had been. No, this woman-child's hair was the color of fire. Her eyes were intense and cold. \"If you must insist on insulting me, I'll have you leave.\" \"You know I would never say such a thing Eyldis. Do not exaggerate.\" Herger replied rolling his eyes. \"And yet you did you old woman,\" Eyldis snapped. Her eyes turned to Ibn and she stared at him coldly. \"Are you the Arab my sister and the other warriors have spoken so highly of?\" \"He is,\" Weath assured her. \"And we did not kidnap, bribe, or trick the man into coming here Eyldis.\" \"We shall see,\" was all Eyldis would say as she turned back to the interior of the hut. \"You may come in.\" Ibn looked to the two other warriors for support. They merely shrugged. \"That's her way,\" Herger said casually. \"Are you going to go in little brother, or are you afraid of a little woman?\" \"He'd be wise to fear that little woman,\" Weath said with a laugh. \"I do not fear a woman,\" Ibn stated the fact as if he were certain, but inside he wasn't. In truth, he was terrified of the woman and of the twins that were his own. He could never tell his warrior brothers that though. He would never live it down.

It had not been his day. It had just been all aroundnnerve wracking and rough. He was happy to finally be home now, though. Henwas happy to be home to his lovely wife and beautiful newborn twin kids.nHis head only began to pound harder when he entered the room, to find hisnkids screaming and his wife at her wit's end. Considering that his wife wasnthe 5th Element, the Supreme Being, the perfect creation, this worriednKorben. The two eldest children were in the corner; a boy of five and angirl of seven looked up at their father's arrival. They'd stopped fightingnand beamed. \"DADDY!\" They excitedly squealed in perfect unison. Then they dropped thentoy they were fighting over and ran towards their dad, eager to hug him.nKorben smiled and scooped the two of them up. \"So, what'd you kids do today?\" He asked. \"We made cookie dough maps in school today,\" Squealed the girl happily. \"You did?\" Kobren replied. \"Yes! Mine's in the kitchen!\" She beamed proudly. \"And the teacher hung myndrawing up on the black board!\" \"Really, Amy?\" Korben smiled, \"That's my artist!\" \"Daddy! Daddy!\" Squealed the boy In Korben's other arm. \"I helped thenteacher bake cookies at day care!\" \"Wow! You're getting to be quite the chef, aren't you, Robby?\" Korbennsmiled down at his son. \"NO! STAY OUT OF THE CREAM!\" Leeloo's frustrated shout came from the baby'snnursery. \"Why don't we go help Mommy?\" Korben Suggested. With that, he carried hisntwo children in to the nursery, where Leeloo was trying to keep Angelo, thenmore active of the twins, out of the diaper cream while changing the othernone's diaper. \"How can you two go to the bathroom at the exact same time?\" She askednAngelo and his sister, Isis. She turned and Saw Korben standing in the doornway with her son and daughter. \"Hi,\" he smiled. \"Oh, good,\" She said, \"You're home. And you go the other two. Korben… cannyou help me here?\" \"Oh, sure,\" Korben said, snapping too. The two children waited patientlynfor their parents to change the babies. \"Where's Larrita?\" Korben asked. \"Out with some friends at the library. They have that test tomorrow,\"nLeeloo informed him \"Oh, right,\" Korben said, picking up his baby daughter. \"Did Amy tell you about the cookie dough map?\" Leeloo asked. \"Yes--\" Korben started, but was cut off by his energetic daughter. \"It was the first thing I told him! And I told him about the picture and Intold him about…\" Amy went on as seven-year-olds usually do, following hernparents into the living room. After Larrita, their first had been born theynbought a much bigger apartment. Larrita was seventeen. About an hour later, everything had settled down until, that its, Larritancame home. It's been that Larrita was extremely loud or very boisterous, (except whennshe went on one of her tirades, that is). It was just that her siblingsnrelished in torturing her. Even the newborn twins seemed to love it. Asnsoon as she got home it was non-stop yelling and squealing. Or yelling,nsquealing and terrified screaming once Larrita got close to nabbing one ofnthem or actually getting them. \"COME BACK HERE, CHILD THING FROM HELL!\" The angry Larrita shouted. Robbynran laughing across the doorframe, wildly waving about her favoritenorganizer. \"Hmmmmm…. I see Robby's been getting braver,\" Korben observed while readingna newspaper. He and Leeloo were used to it by now. \"Yes,\" Replied Leeloo, in the opposite chair, reading a novel, \"Amy seemsnto have left off for a while.\" \"She was really gutsy there for a while,\" Korben said, \"Must be getting tonthat stage where she'd like to bond with her big sister… or she's planningnsomething.\" \"AH HA!\" Came Larrita's shouted. There was a thud as Larrita threw herselfnat Robby, who let out a terrified screech, dropped the organizer and rannlike hell. Robby ran back in through the living room, into his room.nLarrita came stalking in \"LISTEN HERE, CURSED CREATURE! YOU EVER TOUCH MYnORGANIZER AGAIN, ANY OF THEM, AND I WILL RIP YOUR ARMS OFF AND BEAT YOUnWITH THEM!!\" \"Larrita,\" Leeloo sighed, \"He's only five, you know.\" \"He knows enough to leave my stuff the HELL alone, especially mynorganizers!\" Larrita said, stalking back off. Her parents used to try tonget her to stop swearing; they'd long since given up. There didn't seem tonbe much point in it anymore. \"AMY!\" Larrita screamed, \"GET OUT OF MY ROOM!\" \"Yup,\" said Korben, turning the page of his newspaper, \"She was planningnsomething.\" In Larrita's room, Larrita had stalked up to Amy. \"Out, out, brief candle,\" She growled, pointing to the door. \"But…\" replied Amy. \"But nothing, demon child!\" Snapped Larrita, grabbing her by the back ofnher shirt collar, starting to drag her to the door. \"I only wanted to watch you put on make up for your date tonight!\" WhinednAmy desperately. \"For the love of…\" Larrita Sighed. \"It's not a date, Amy. I'm going with mynbest friends to see the newest Maverick Gibbons movie. I won't be puttingnon any more makeup than I already have on.\" Larrita had on blue body glitter, gold eye shadow, faded red lipstick, goldnfacial make up with pink blush and she'd used eyeliner to make her eyesnlook Egyptian. \"Will you be changing clothes?\" Amy asked \"No.\" Larrita replied \"Are you going to put on any more jewelry?\" Amy asked, hopefully. \"N…\" Larrita started but then thought and changed her mind, \"Yes,\" shenreplied. \"Can I watch?\" Amy inquired, hopefully. \"Sure,\" Replied Larrita. Amy watched as Larrita grabbed an Egyptian stylednbracelet, an armlet, and necklace, and then grabbed some Celtic rings andnnecklaces and Grecian-Roman type earrings and put them on. \"You look pretty,\" Amy smiled. \"Thanks,\" said Larrita, doing her best to smile back. \"Do you have any homework?\" Amy asked, with a hopeful tone. \"No, I did it all at the library today, before I came home.\" \"Any extra credit?\" \"I have mostly mean teachers, who don't give extra credit.\" \"Oh, any books you have to read?\" \"No.\" \"When does the movie start?\" \"8:30\" \"What time is it now?\" \"6:00…\" Larrita sighed. \"Who are you going with?\" \"Some friends.\" \"Any boys?\" \"Yeah, a couple.\" \"Any romantic interests?\" \"Big words for such a little girl. I see we've been expanding ourn vocabulary.\" \"You're changing the subject.\" \"Whatever.\" \"So?\" \"So what?\" \"Any Boyfriends?\" \"Do you know anyone who'd want to be my boyfriend?\" \"Everyone I know is in first grade.\" \"Point taken.\" \"So?\" \"So WHAT?\" \"Any Boyfriends??\" \"You all ready asked that.\" \"You didn't answer.\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"You didn't answer it to the fullest satisfaction of my curiosity.\" \"My, my, we're throwing about the five dollar words, aren't we?\" \"Just answer the question.\" \"I did.\" \"You didn't answer my inquiry to my fullest satisfaction. Answer it inn more direct terms.\" \"What? Have you been reading the dictionary or something?\" \"Any boyfriends?\" \"Amy, I'm not exactly the nicest girl in school. I don't think you'lln find a guy within the solar system who's suicidal enough to be myn boyfriend.\" \"Any crushes?\" \"What?\" \"Any crushes?\" \"Why do you care?\" \"I just do. So, do you have a crush on anyone.\" \"No.\" \"You sure?\" \"Yes.\" \"Really sure?' \"Yes.\" \"Really, really, REALLY sure?\" \"YES!\" Larrita shouted. \"I think I would know.\" \"Positive?\" Asked Amy. \"YES!!!!!\" Shouted Larrita even louder than before, \"And even if In did, do you honestly think I would tell you?\" \"Can I take that as a yes?\" Larrita sighed, and closed her eyes. \"Take what as a yes?\" She asked. \"That you have a crush.\" Replied Amy. \"NO!!!!\" Larrita shouted, refraining herself from making her littlen sister one with the outside wall. \"No what?\" Asked Amy. \"NO, I DO NOT HAVE A GODDAMN CRUSH, YOU LITTLE IMP OF SATAN!\" Larritan shouted. \"How many friends?\" \"Five.\" \"The Movie's at 8:30?\" \"Yes.\" \"What time is it now?\" Larrita sighed and looked at the clock. \"6:15.\" \"What's it called?\" \"Lethal War.\" \"Lethal War?\" \"Yes.\" \"Aren't all wars lethal?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then why'd they call it 'Lethal War'?\" \"I haven't the foggiest.\" \"Can I go with you?\" \"Sorry kiddo, it's rated R for violence.\" \"Then how can you go?\" \"Mom and Dad said I could, because I'm such a big fan of Maverick Gibbons.nAnd besides, I'm 17, I make the cut off,\" Replied Larrita \"How old do you have to be to see a rated R movie?\" \"With out an adult?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Seventeen or older.\" \"Oh. You sure I can't go?\" \"Maybe if Mom and Dad say you can, you can come,\" Larrita said, hoping tonget the cute little cling-on to leave her alone for a few seconds. Amy rannout to where her parents were still sitting in the living room. Larritansighed and walked out after her, being sure to shut and lock her door tonkeep Robby out of it. \"Mommy! Daddy!\" Cried Amy, running in. \"Larrita, what did you do?\" Leeloo asked. \"She's only seven, take it easy on her,\" Korben looked at Larrita. \"Daddy! Can I go to see 'Lethal War' with Larrita and her friends?\" Amynasked eagerly. Leeloo dropped her book and Korben looked like he was aboutnto pass out. Larrita gave her dad a pathetic 'Pleeeaaaseee…. No….' looknbehind Amy's back. \"That's a really violent movie, Amy,\" Korben Started. \"It ain't called 'Lethal War' for nothing…\" Added Larrita, as if it wasngoing to help. \"It's a Maverick Gibbon's movie, and his R rated onesnusually have lots of fighting, big explosions, blood and guts.\" \"'Deadly Actions' didn't have too much blood and guts,\" Said Amy. \"How would you know?\" Larrita raised an eyebrow. \"You're only seven. You'vennever seen any of the 'Deadly Actions' movies.\" \"Remember, you were watching it on the TV when it was on,\" Amy said. \"That's on TV. That's the abridged version. They edited it for content,\"nLarrita explained. \"Why?\" Asked Amy. \"Because little Kids like you might be watching,\" Said Larrita. Leeloo andnKorben were trying not to laugh. They were highly amused at watching theirneldest daughter trying to worm her way out of taking her younger sister tonthe movies with her. As amusing as it was, Korben felt he had to intervenenand rescue his poor daughter from the clutches of her little sister.nUsually, it was the other way around. It was only fair that Korben showednthem both the same courtesy. \"Sweetheart. That's a really adult movie. Maybe when you're older you canngo,\" He said. He could see that Amy was disappointed. After a moment'snthought he added, \"But, I'll tell you what, I'll take you and your brothernto see that cartoon thing you guys wanna see.\" \"Really?\" The little girl grinned. \"THANK YOU DADDY!\" She ran as fast asnher little seven-year-old legs would carry her to her dad and hugged him,nwhile Larrita took the opportunity to get the hell out while the gettingnwas good. Around 6:30, Larrita's best friend Bergita came over. Unfortunately, Amyngot to the door before Larrita. \"Hello,\" Amy said. \"Hi. I'm here meet Larrita,\" Bergita leaned over and smiled. \"For the movie? It's only 6:30 and the Movie doesn't start until 8:30. Isnthere something the matter with your watch?\" Amy asked pleasantly. \"No, I'm here so that we can chat before we go to the movies,\" Bergitanexplained. \"Why? Why not wait until you go to the movies?\" Amy asked. \"Because we want to talk before we go to the movies.\" \"Oh, girl talk?\" Amy smiled. \"Yes,\" Bergita smiled back. Bergita was saved from further Question and Answer when Larrita roughlynpulled Amy by the scruff of the neck away from the door. \"Beat it, brat!\" She shouted loudly, right into Amy's ear. Amy sure didn'tnneed to be told twice. As soon as Larrita let go of the collar, Amy wasngone like a shot. \"Sorry about the barrage of questions from the lower life form,\" Larritansaid. \"It's all right,\" Bergita said. \"Come on, let's go into your room! I havensoooo much to tell you.\" The two girls entered Larrita's room to find Amy waiting nervously there. \"Get out, child of Satan!\" Screeched Larrita. When Amy didn't obey, Larritanbegan to stalk up to her. \"Out, damn spot!\" She shouted. \"PPPPLLLLLLLEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSSEEEEEEEEE, Laurie, can I stay?\" Amy begged. \"No,\" Said Larrita firmly. \"I wanna talk with you,\" Whined Amy. \"Get out,\" Responded Larrita, pointing at the door. \"Oh please?\" Implored Amy. \"I wanna talk girl talk, too!\" \"No, Amy,\" Larrita said. She grabbed Amy's arm and began to drag her out. \"Please, Laurie? Please?\" Amy began to sniffle. Larrita sighed. \"Amy,\" She said, \"Why don't you go talk girl talk with Mommy?\" \"No one talks girl talk with their mom,\" responded Amy. \"You'd be surprised,\" Larrita muttered. Ever the peacemaker, Bergitanstepped in. \"How about this. We have a while until the movie. You can stay with us fornthe first…\" \"Twenty Minutes,\" Said Larrita, cutting of Bergita before she promised Amynsomething horrible like an hour and a half. \"Really?\" Amy's face brightened. \"Yes,\" Said Larrita. Amy squealed with glee and jumped on the bed. \"ACK! OFF, OFF, OFF DEMON THING FROM HELL!\" Larrita shouted. Amy jumped offnin a New York minute and sat Indian Style on the floor. Larrita's desk andnbed were complete off limit zones. Larrita sighed and grabbed her timer,nsetting it for 20 minutes. Amy thoroughly enjoyed the next 20 minutes she spent with her big sisternand her sister's best friend. It was mainly Amy and Bergita talking.nLarrita was too busy being in pain to take much part in the conversation. \"So Bobby said…\" Bergita was telling a complete enthralled Amy when thenTimer went off. \"Okay, Aims…. Time's up,\" Larrita said, happy to be able to kick Amy out ofnher room now. \"But…\" Amy started. \"But nothing Kid,\" Larrita cut her off. \"I wanna hear what Bobby said!\" wined Amy. \"All right, then you have to get out. Bergita, what did Bobby say?\" Larritansighed. \"Bobby said that he knew the game that Libby was playing and that henwouldn't date a snobby b… WITCH like Libby in a thousand years. Even if shenwere the last female of any species in the universe,\" Bergita. Amy squealednwith glee, and even Larrita seemed happy that her arch nemesis had beenntorn to shreds. \"Good for him!\" Amy smiled. \"You can say that again, kiddo. I'm glad someone told Libby off, finally.nBesides me, I mean. Anyway, your time has run out, Amy,\" Larrita said. \"Okay! Thanks!\" Amy grinned, leaving the room. \"Thank God THAT'S over, \" sighed Larrita, glad to be rid of her little impnsister. \"Don't sweat it, Larrita. She's just in that 'sister love' stage right now,nI went through it, and all of my younger sisters are going through it,\"nBergita said. Bergita came from a HUGE family. There were only five Kids innLarrita's family. There were nine in Bergita's. \"I feel a great swell of pity for you,\" Larrita said. \"You still have another one to deal with,\" Bergita observed. \"I'll be in college by that time. I'll have escaped Isis,\" Larrita toldnher. \"Isis? That's a strange name…\" Bergita said. \"It's ancient Egyptian,\" Said Larrita, \"Isis was a goddess in AncientnEgyptian mythology. She was married to Osiris, the first Pharaoh god ofnEgypt. Isis was his sister. Their son was Horace, the falcon headed god,nand the first Pharaoh,\" Larrita explained. \"Thank you, Ms. Know-It-All,\" Bergita said sarcastically. \"What's the othernone's name?\" \"Angelo,\" Said Larrita, \"It's an Italian name.\" \"Larrita, Isis, Angelo. You people have such weird names. Leeloo, Korben…nWell Korben's not such a weird name but… Why is it only Amy and Robby havennormal names?\" \"Actually, only Robby has a completely normal name,\" Larrita explained. \"Amy's pretty normal,\" Replied Bergita. \"Her full name is Amethyst. It's Mom's favorite stone and her birth stone,\"nSaid Larrita. \"And Robby?\" \"Robert,\" Larrita stated. \"Why does he have just a normal name?\" Asked Bergita. \"He's named for Grandma,\" Answered Larrita. \"You're Grandmother's name is Robert?!\" Bergita gasped. \"Roberta,\" Larrita informed her. \"Oh… I'd ask why a boy is named after her, but I'm too afraid of what you'dnsay. What about your name?\" Bergita asked. \"I haven't the foggiest,\" Said Larrita, \"It's something to do with thendivine language. My Full name, First, middle and last is about 20 lettersnlong,\" Larrita said. \"And I thought Bergita was a weird name…\" Sighed Bergita. \"It's actually an old German name,\" Larrita informed her. \"What time is it?\" Bergita asked. \"It's almost seven,\" Larrita answered. \"Good,\" Bergita answered, \"Because I have SOOOO much to tell you. Includingnthe part of the on going saga between our friend Bobby and the Snob that isnLibby that was too inappropriate for young Amethyst's ears.\" \"Ohhh, delicious,\" Larrita leaned in, \"Do tell.\" \"Well,\" Bergita said, \"It seems that Libby isn't the sweet, innocent thingnthat she pretends to be.\" \"Old news,\" Said Larrita. \"Wait till I finish,\" Said Bergita, \"Unbeknownst to most, she's one of thenbiggest sluts in school.\" \"WHAT?\" Larrita practically fell out of her chair, \"How come no guys havenbeen talking about it?\" \"Because she bribes them. Bobby found this out,\" Bergita said. \"How did Bobby find out? He hates her almost as much as I do,\" Larritansaid. \"He walked in the on the exchange, and over heard a lot of it before eithernnoticed he was behind the locker.\" \"The locker?\" Larrita asked. \"Where was this?\" \"The boys Locker room, after school.\" \"How much was she paying him to keep his mouth shut?\" Larrita questions. \"The payment wasn't entirely in cash…\" That time Larrita actually DID fall out of her chair. \"Bobby forgot his sneakers in the locker room during Gym. He had to go backnand get them. He walked in on it and it was a while before anyone noticednhe was hiding behind the locker. He was hoping to get out without eithernnoticing. When Libby found out, she figured she could bribe him as well. Hentold her to get stuffed, that he didn't care,\" Bergita said. \"Oh Christ,\" Sighed Larrita, \"This is almost more than I really wannanknow.\" \"So she's been dogging him to go out with her so she can see if she can…\" \"I can guess,\" Said Larrita, disgusted even more with her nemesis. \"Goodnfor Bobby, though.\" \"Supposedly, there's more to this story,\" Said Bergita, \"But I don't knownwhat it is.\" \"There's gossip that YOU don't know about… I'm worried…\" Larrita Quipped. \"Bobby can tell us himself after the movie,\" Bergita said, casually. \"Excuse me?\" Said Larrita. \"I invited him,\" Bergita grinned wickedly. \"You WHAT?\" \"He said since we hate Libby as much as he does, he'll tell us after we seenthe movie. I figured since we were going out for coffee anyway… He's also anMaverick Gibbons Fan,\" Bergita said. \"Anyway, on to other matters…\" SaidnBergita, as Larrita leaned in to hear. At 8 O' Clock, the doorbell rang. Once again, Amy got to the door beforenLarrita and Bergita. \"Hi,\" Amy said cheerily, \"You must be Larrita's friends.\" \"Yes, Can you get her for us, sweety?\" Said Sierra, a pretty black girlnwith dark eyes and short, purple hair. \"It's only 8 O' Clock. Aren't you a little early?\" Asked Amy. \"We came early, so we could be early for the movie,\" Said a boy. \"What's your name?\" Amy asked. \"Bobby…\" He said. Amy almost fell over. Around that time, Larrita camenrunning out, flanked by Bergita. \"AMY!\" She screeched. \"You little pain in my ass! Get the hell away fromnthe door and stop bothering my friends or I'll skin you alive!\" She grabbednAmy by the collar and tugged back. \"Mom, Dad, my friends are here. We'rengoing to the movie.\" \"Bye, Larrita, have a good time!\" Said Leeloo. \"Don't maim anyone,\" Said Korben. Larrita and Bergita grabbed their jacketsnand headed out the door with the group. The group consisted of Larrita,nBergita themselves, and Bobby, Sierra, Eric, Celeste, and Estralita.nEstralita was a petite Spanish girl with rich skin, dark brown eyes andnsilky Jet black hair. Celeste was a lovely French girl. She had thicknblonde hair, which was tired into an exquisite and artistic hairstyle, andnshe had soft Green eyes. She wore a light dusting of classic make up andnlong a long flowing dress of rich color and fabric. Sierra was a lovelynblack girl. She had short purple hair that used to be a rich dark brown.nBobby was the son of two first generation Irish immigrants. He had rednhair, blue eyes and pale skin. Eric Was an Egyptian looking boy. Bergitanhad dark hair, eyes and pale skin. Larrita's hair was a mixture of hernmother's odd red hair and her father's blonde hair. She had his eyes andnher skin. \"Larrita,\" Bergita started, \"this is…\" \"Bobby, yeah, yeah,\" She said, \"I know him from Third period Trig.\" \"Ah.\" \"So, was that your little sister?\" Bobby asked. \"No… it was the ghost of my great, great grandmother,\" Larrita answered,nsarcastically. \"She's cute,\" Said Bobby. \"Noooo… she isn't. She's the heiress of Satan,\" Larrita informed him. \"Larrita and her siblings do not get a long well,\" Bergita said. \"Why am I not surprised?\" Replied Bobby and they got into a taxicab. \"Hey! The little imps torture me!\" Larrita defended herself. \"To the moviesnon the corner of 5th and 9th,\" She told the cab driver. \"Don't worry, Larrita, You'll be out of there in less than a year,\" SaidnSierra. Sierra had a thick Jamaican accent. \"Oui,\" said Celeste, \"A couple of months at the most. The year is almostnover. Soon you will be in college.\" \"A couple of months can't come fast enough,\" Larrita said. \"So, anyone read a review on the movie?\" Asked Bobby. \"No,\" Said Larrita, \"I find that reviews are pointless. The critics verynrarely know good movies when they seem them. They have bad taste.\" \"Isn't it the truth?\" Said Estralita. \"Yes,\" Replied Eric. \"I happen to read them,\" Said Sierra. \"You also read fashion and teen magazines,\" Larrita pointed out. \"There is nothing wrong with teen and fashion magazines. You may want tonread one, retro-ancient Rambo Goth girl,\" Said Sierra, gesturing tonLarrita's dark cloths, camouflage shirt and her strange make up andnJewelry. \"I'm cut, really…\" Said Larrita, dryly. \"Oh, and I'm not Goth.\" \"I also read teen and fashion magazines,\" Said Bergita. \"And the National inquirer,\" Remarked Larrita. \"I read Teen magazine,\" Said Estralita \"So do I,\" Celeste chimed in. \"Can we NOT talk about this?\" Eric asked. Just then, Larrita happened tonlook out the window of the cab. One look at the sky line and she knew theynwere no where near the theater. \"Hey,\" Said Larrita, \"We're no where near 9th and 5th!\" \"A minor detour,\" Said the driver in the front seat. He had a strangen accent that Larrita could only guess was Hungarian. \"A thousandn apologies.\" \"What detour?\" Larrita demanded. Just then, the cab driver made an sharp turn that sent the passengers lurching to the side. \"What are you doing?\" Bergita snapped, \"Trying to kill us?\" \"No tip for you!\" Hissed Eric. \"Why are you driving us even further away from the movies?!\" Larritan demanded. \"It is only a minor detour. We will be there shortly,\" The drivern assured her. \"Shortly?! We're several blocks away!\" Said Estralita, who recognizedn her favorite clothing store out side the cab window. \"Pleas be patient. Traffic and the road is not on our side today,\" Then driver said. \"I have a bad feeling about this,\" Larrita whispered to her friends. \"I don't think he's taking us to the movies,\" Replied Bobby. Estralitan looked out the window. The Mall. It gave her an idea. \"Sir,\" She said politely. \"We'll be getting out here, at the mall ifn you'd be so kind.\" \"But I thought you said you were going to the movies,\" Said then driver. \"We changed out mind,\" Larrita coldly replied. \"If you would wait..\" The driver started, but Celeste cut him off. \"There is a movie in the mall. We will simply go there,\" She said. \"Are you sure?\" The driver asked. \"Oh yes,\" Said Eric, \"Quite sure.\" \"Very well,\" Said the driver stopping and pulling over to the parkingn lot of the mall. \"That will be $2.50.\" \"Larrita hurriedly pushed a twenty dollar bill into his hand throughn the window. \"Keep the change,\" She said as they hurried into the mall. As they headednto the movies, the driver outside cursed his luck and cursed what he'd havento deal with when he returned with out the girl.[Chapter 2] A/N: In case there is any confusion, \"Larrita\" is pronounced \"La-Rita\" andnBergita is \"Ber-Gita\".

He wasnin for it now. He sighed. He'd screwed up a simple mission like gettingnsome seventeen-year-old girl. The building was dark and tall. It had beennthe building of the former Zorg Industries. It was where his presentnemployers were stationed. Actually, they were all over the planet, but fornsome reason had come here and rented the building. He guessed it hadnsomething to do with the reason why they wanted him to go get the girl.nBenny never asked Questions, he just did what he was told for the rightnamount of money… And he usually screwed it up, like he had done this time.nHe got out of the cab and started towards the entrance of the building toninform them of his failure. He sighed. He really WAS in for it now. Benny, the little squinty guy that he was, walked through the halls intonthe office. It was the office at the top of the building, and it was veryndark. A figure sat in a chair at a desk, the back of the chair facing thendoor, so he could look out of the window at the night time city. Bennynentered the office room very quietly, hoping he wouldn't be noticed. Nondice. \"I trust you have it done,\" The man said. Benny was trying to sneak in.nThat meant that he hadn't done it. Why was he not surpirsed? \"Well… not exactly,\" Benny started. The chair figured and the figure, halfncovered by shadows leered at him. \"Am I to assume that that is the reason why you do not have the girl withnyou now?\" He asked, his lit eyebrow rasied. \"Well… Yes, sir,\" Said the nervous Benny. \"Find the girl, bring her back here. It was not that hard an assignment,nyet you easily screwed it up. We sole a cab for you. All you had to do wasnmeet the girl at her apartment, and bring her here,\" Was the reply. \"She had friends with her,\" Benny stated. \"You could have brought them, too. It's not as if we don't have facilitiesnenough for them,\" Said the dark figure in the chair. \"They noticed I wasn't taking them to the theater and got out,\" Benny said,nfumbling. \"What? Did they jump out of the cab?\" \"No sir, they told me they wanted to get out at the mall,\" Benny said,nrealizing that that wasn't the brightest thing to say. \"And you let them out?\" The figure asked. \"Yes… they were on to me. They knew something was up,\" Benny said. \"Then you should have driven them here anyway. Just stomp on the gas pedalnand radio us. We'd be there to meet you and get them,\" The figure said. \"Yes, well, I'm… I'm… errrr… Sorry, Sir,\" Benny said, stumbling over hisnwords. \"You have precious few chances left, don't waste them like you wasted thisnone.\" \"Yes, Sir,\" Benny said, hurriedly excusing himself from the room. The mannsighed to himself. That git was a complete and utter loser. Why did he putnup with him? Because, he might still be useful, that's why. Because henstill had to complete his mission, more importantly. Larrita, Bergita, Bobby, Celeste, Sierra, Estralita, and Eric were in thencoffee shop at the mall. They had just finished discussing the movie andnBobby had filled them in on all the details of the on going saga betweennhim and Libby. Then the subject came up about the encounter with thenstrange cab driver. \"What was up with him?\" Bergita asked, taking a sip of her strong coffee. \"I don't know,\" Larrita said, taking a sip of her hazelnut. \"I could not place his accent. Did any of you catch it?\" Celeste asked,nputting down her cup of light French Vanilla with complete toppings \"It seemed either French or Hungarian,\" Larrita said. \"He was weird, whatever his accent was,\" Bobby said, taking a gulp of hisnIrish Cream. \"More importantly,\" Estralita asked, \"How do we get home?\" \"Good question,\" Said Eric. \"We can call my dad,\" Larrita suggested, \"Then you guys can come back overnto my house. You can call your parents from there.\" \"At any rout,\" Eric said, \"I think we should avoid the cabs.\" \"Tell me about it,\" Said Larrita, pulling out her phone and dialing hernhome number. Benny sat in the cab outside the mall, waiting for the group to remerge. Ifnthey used a cab to get to the mall, they'd need one to get back. Then he'dnhave them and he wouldn't fail this time. Another car pulled in a fewnspaces away. A few minutes later the Larrita and her friends came out ofnthe mall. Bingo, thought Benny. He watched as the group exited the mall, then, withndisappointment as they walked to the car. As he squinted at the driver, henrealized who the driver was. Damn, Benny thought, cursing his bad luck, The little brats must have beennsuspicious and called her dad. He continued to glare out of the window, watching as the kids got intonKorben Dallas' car. Damn, damn, double damn, he hissed mentally. He watched them go, thennpulled out of the parking lot. He'd get them tomorrow. He didn't need allnof the others anyway... Just that one damned girl; just that LarritanDallas. He sighed. He'd have to find away to get her tomorrow. Unbeknownstnto him, he wasn't the only one watching Larrita Dallas, and his employersnweren't the only one keeping tabs on the Dallases in General. One Mannwatched from the darkness of the shadows of the unlit parts of mall parkingnlot, as he had watched as he followed the cab. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------n----------------------------------------------------- Hope you liked it.

Angelo and Isis were sound asleep in their cribs. Korben had the day off for some reason. His boss had shown up at Korben's office and said that since things were going slow that day, you just head home. After the whole thing with Leeloo and saving the world, Korben didn't go back to the Cabby Company he had been fired from, even though they asked him to come back. They Cab company had been all right while he was providing for just himself, but when he got a family to work for, he had to get a better Job. Finger had also been fired. Unofficially, the president was able to put them both in some company positions in businesses. Korben and Leeloo were relaxing when a knock at the door rudely interrupted them. \"I'll get it,\" Korben said, getting out of his chair. He walked out of the living room and towards the front door. When he opened it, he was in for somewhat of a shock, and not an all to pleasant one. Three people, Two men and a woman, stood on the other side of the door, and they all looked like hell. The girl looked to be in her early to mid-20's, but also looked like she was drug through hell backwards and beaten six ways to Sunday. Her dark hair was a mess. It was frizzy, unruly, pretty greasy, indicating that it hadn't been washed in a considerable amount of time, knotted and at least three inches of it was dead split ends. Her clothes were dirty and looked like she had slept in them for several consecutive nights. Her dark green eyes were blood shot and had dark circles under them. Korben couldn't tell if her skin color was dark from tan or grime. Her skin could very well have been that color naturally, as the girl looked to be a mix of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, And European/Celtic decent. He still thought that the layers of dirt that probably covered her had something to do with it. She looked like she'd been in tattoo fights. Her arms, particularly her shoulders were covered with tattoos. Almost to the point of absurdity. On both shoulders was a sort of uniform tattoo that they all seemed to have. It was strange and intricate; Korben had never seen anything like it before. Oh no , groaned Korben inwardly, PLEASE, don't let them be a cult of some sort here to recruit us or fund raise . The girl had strange circular tattoos that were two tones with a diamond in them, a strange triangular one on the top of her wrist with an Egyptian looking eye, two black figures and a sun or something at the top of the pyramid. Near the joint where her thumb connected to her hand was an Egyptian looking eye as well. She looked like she had been written on in several different languages. Her black leather boots were scuffed and all but falling apart, her black pants were thread bare at the knees and just as dirty as the boots were. Her shirt was sleeveless. It appeared to have sleeves at one time, it looked as if any sleeves ripped off and the cloth around the shoulders was tattered… much like her shoulders. Her shoulders were scuffed, bruised and scarred, as were the rest of her arms. The shirt was a light blue color, or at least it once might have been. Now it seemed grey. It was long and an equally tattered green, blue and red plaid scarf served as a belt. She wore several pieces of jewelry, all seeming to be Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Italian or Celtic in design. The girl smelled very heavily of alcohol, and she was also short. A beaten cheap imitation velvet satchel was tied to the scarf belt, and it seemed to be holding something. The three looked like they had no cash at all, so it probably held what small amount of money they had, Korben reasoned. The thought struck him that the bag could have contained a flask of Booze, with as heavily as the girl smelled of it. The two boys were slightly better looking. One seemed to be a mix of Oriental, Middle Eastern and Hispanic decent, while the other was clearly of African. They booth looked grimy, much like the girl, but their eyes were not blood shot. The Hispanic looking boy had greasy black hair, and wore all black. The dark colors didn't save his clothes from looking like they had been though the scum of the earth, however. His clothes were in almost as bad shape as the girl's. He also looked as if he had slept in them. His skin was very dark, but Korben couldn't tell if it was his ethnicity or the dirt on him. He smelled of cheap after-shave, as if he was trying to cover the fact that he probably hadn't touched water in a long time. At least he didn't smell of alcohol. His boots were scuffed but in pretty good condition. Korben thought that this was probably because they were combat boots. He looked to have some muscle, but not much. The black boy was probably the best out of the three. His hair looked nappy, but at least not as greasy as the other two's. His clothes were worn, but not like he'd slept in them. He wore combat boots, like the Hispanic guy, and worn, grimy khakis and a black sleeveless shirt. He looked to be older than the other two, in his mid twenties to early thirties. There seemed to be some bags behind them or something, but the terrible trio obscured his view. The two boys hadn't nearly the amount of tattoos that the girl had. \"Yes?\" Korben said to the three people in front of him. \"Mr. Dallas?\" The tall Black man asked. Korben nodded. \"Mr. Korben Dallas?\" The Black man asked again. \"Pal, my name's on the door,\" Korben said. \"Told you,\" The girl said. Korben was surprised she could speak coherently. He would have thought her to be slobbering drunk with all the Booze she smelled of. \"I told you to just knock on the door, that the name was accurate. Maybe you should listen to me a bit more. I'm drunk, not stupid.\" The Black man ignored her and went on. \"Is there a…\" he pulled out a ripped, smudged piece of paper and squinted at it, \" a Ms… Leeloo here as well?\" He asked. Korben looked at him suspiciously. \"Who wants to know?\" He asked. \"Take that as a yes. I can guarantee you that's a yes,\" The girl blurted. \"And a Father Cornelia?\" The Black man ignored her and went on. \"Sorry, you have the wrong place,\" Korben said. \"But the Leeloo chick is there, I'd bet a bottle of bourbon on it. This guy has to be that Dallas guy we're,\" The girl said. The Black and Hispanic boys shot her a look of shock, then looked at each other. \"I can't believe she's is willing to bet Booze,\" Said the Hispanic boy, the Black boy just ignored him and went on. \"Mr. Dallas, It's important that we speak with you, Ms. Leeloo…\" \"Mrs. Dallas,\" Korben corrected him. \"I knew it. I win a bottle of bourbon,\" the girl said. \"… With you, Mrs. Dallas and Father Cornelius. It's very important,\" The Black man finished. \"Mind telling me what about, first?\" Korben said. \"Something very important,\" The Hispanic man said. \"Yeah, yeah, I got that part. You tell me what it is you want, or you're not setting foot in my apartment. Got that?\" Korben glared at the three. \"It concerns the elements. Including your wife. Really important. The entire fate of the world we're talking. Really quite important,\" The girl said, stepping forward. \"How do I know you aren't trying to pull something?\" Korben eyed them suspiciously. \"How do you know we are?\" The girl asked. Korben started to shut the door. \"Wait!\" The Hispanic man cried out. The girl threw herself at the door effectively getting herself caught in it. \"Your wife has a tattoo on one of her wrists that identifies her as the divine being. It has the sign of the four elements. Your wife's the fifth element,\" The Girl said quickly. She showed her own wrist, which had two tattoos, on like Leeloo's and the other was a bit different. There were five sets of wavy lines, not four. \"I think he knows that,\" The Black man said. \"Get out of here, now ,\" Korben threatened. \"Look, This is important!\" The girl shouted, her body still in the door. \"Get out,\" Korben said, then slammed the door a few times on the girl. \"ARGH!!!\" The girl howled in pain. \"Look, if you get that priest guy here, he can sort of validate us,\" The Hispanic man said. \"I said, leave ,\" Korben said as he slammed the door once again on the girl who had wedged herself in the frame. She cried out again and fell to the floor. However, she landed inside the door. Korben lifted her by the scruff of the neck of her shirt and tossed her out then slammed the door. Out side, the three could hear it lock. \"Well,\" The girl said, \"I think that went relatively well.\" The Hispanic man looked down at her and kicked her, rather roughly. \"OUCH!\" She yelped. \"Pain…\" \"Annie!\" He said, \"Why couldn't you have just left well enough alone?\" \"Look, I'm not a total waste you know,\" The girl replied. \"It seems like it. Omar probably could have talked our way in there,\" The Hispanic looking boy replied. \"If I'm such a waste, why did you even bother to have me tag along? Why don't you just get on with out me?\" The Girl asked evenly, still in too much pain to even get off the floor. \"I don't know. This would be a lot easier with out you here. I don't see what purpose you serve. You're a drunk, a caffeine addict, and a psychopath, among other things. This'd be a lot easier with out you,\" He replied. \"Fine then,\" The girl replied, dragging herself over to a large camouflage rucksack on the floor, \" You guys go on with out me. Soon as I can stand again, I'll be out of your way.\" \"That's a damn relief, don't know why you're even here at all.\" \"She's here,\" The Black man said, \"because she speaks, reads and writes several languages and because she knows the geography. On top of the fact that she's smaller than you and I and can slip into places we can't, and she's a pretty good fighter.\" \"Whatever… Why are you getting the whiskey out now? Of all the times to drink! Can't you go five goddamn seconds with out getting sauced,\" The Hispanic man yelled. The girl just held up her small bottle of whiskey and a cloth. \"It's not to drink, it's to disinfect the fresh injuries and ease the pain in my jaw. Getting slammed in that door ripped open some stitched and that cut from,\" The girl began, but was cut off. \"Would that be the bar fight or street fight?\" The Hispanic Man asked. \"Probably the bar fight,\" The girl replied. She winced as she applied the whiskey to her injuries. \"What a waste of whiskey,\" She said after she had finished. The Hispanic man sighed. \"Let's get you bandaged,\" he said. \"Nab,\" Said the girl, \"I'll be fine. We'll worry about it later.\" \"It'll get infected.\" \"That's what the whiskeys for.\" \"Who was that?\" Leeloo asked. \"I don't know. Three punks that look like they've been through hell and back. They wanted to talk about something, but they rubbed me the wrong way. I had a bad feeling about them,\" Korben informed her. \"I heard a lot of yelling,\" Leeloo stated. \"Well, that was probably because I closed the door on one of them,\" Korben replied, sitting down, Leeloo bolted up straight. \"What?!\" She cried. \"I was about to shut the door when one of them threw herself in front of it. I slammed it on her a couple of times to get them to leave,\" Korben stated nonchalantly. \"What did they want?\" Leeloo questioned. \"I don't know. They seemed to know a good bit about you. I was suspicious, especially after Larrita's episode with the cab driver at the movies last night,\" Korben replied. Leeloo got up. \"Were are you going?\" \"To see who they are and what they want, if they're still there,\" Leeloo replied. Se walked to the door and opened it. The Scraggily trio was still there; the girl was just now getting up. They turned at the sound of the door opening and saw Leeloo staring out at them. The three immediately did what was some sort of salute or something. Leeloo had never seen anything of the like. \"Mrs. Dallas,\" The black boy said, \"We must speak with you. It's urgent. As I was trying to explain to your husband, the fate of the planet hangs in the balance.\" \"Come in,\" Said Leeloo emotionlessly. The three grabbed their bags and entered the apartment. Korben saw them enter and then gave them a menacing glare. \"Sit down,\" he said coldly. The trio complied. \"Now, what is it?\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Dallas. We need to know where a Father Vito Cornelius is. It's also important that he be here,\" The black man said. \"I will contact him,\" Said Leeloo. \"Well, you can at least tell us your names can't you?\" Korben said. \"Of course,\" The black man said. \"I am Omar, This is Antoinette,\" he said gesturing to the ruff looking girl. \"Annie for short,\" She informed him. \"Lovely,\" Korben smiled sarcastically. \"And your friend?\" \"Miguel,\" The other boy said \"You seem to all ready know us,\" Said Korben. \"I have contacted him. He will be here shortly,\" Leeloo came back in and informed them. \"Good,\" Said Korben. Shortly afterward Father Cornelius arrived. The trio once again did the strange motion that the other occupants of the room could only assume was a salute. \"Okay,\" Korben said, \"The gang's all here. Now what do you want?\" \"Father Cornelius, Are you aware of any group called the Elemental Protect Knot?\" Omar asked. Father Cornelius ' jaw dropped. \"Yes…\" He said, \"Our line knows little about them, but we've some information on them.\" \"Your line?\" Asked Korben. \"Technically speaking,\" Cornelius said, \"We were in charge in the temple of Egypt to guard the five elements while they were on Earth, and we trained to pass on the tradition after they were taken, so we would be informed. We don't know much about the Elemental Protect Knot, we have little information, given to us by unknown members.\" \"It was given to you,\" Stated Annie, \"Because your line of priests and the Elemental Protect Knot is essentially in the same line of business.\" \"Explain, please,\" Korben stated. \"It's a secret society dedicated to serving and protecting mankind and all life in the universe. We're mainly based on Earth, roughly 95 percent of us are human. We do have members from other races, bases on other planets and representatives on other planets. It's mainly centered on Earth. It kind of works the same way as the five elements do. We draw power from the elements to fight off evil, like your wife does. Your wife IS an element, so she herself is part of our great knot,\" Annie said. \"I've never had anything to do with any of this…\" Leeloo said, confused. \"Let me try to explain,\" Annie said, \"The Celts of Europe, and Isles of Great Britain and Ireland have something called a Celtic Knot. Everything is connected; the knots go on forever. It symbolizes how the universe is never ending and everything in the universe is connected. Even though you've never had anything to do with us, you're connected to us because you're an element. We especially do the same thing, just in a different way.\" \"Each member of Elemental Protect Knot has a designated main element, Fire, water, metal, earth or air. Then they have a side element, light, dark or grey. Then a non-concrete element, star, energy, Wisdom, loyalty, honor, strength, lightening, Thunder or freedom. Their next designated element is one from the Periodic Table of Elements like mercury, silver, gold, bromine, et cetera. Last, they all have off world elements, not of Earth. Like grantamine, clofiline, sarlamere, et cetera,\" Omar said, \"And we all connect to the one, great element.\" \"But, what happens when Leeloo dies? She's only human,\" Korben said. \"One of your children takes her place, most likely one of your daughters,\" Miguel explained. \"Wouldn't their DNA be imperfect?\" Korben asked. \"No, their Mother's DNA was engineered to work out the impurities. It's part of her perfect Make-up. Only the purities from both sides are passed on to the children,\" Father Cornelius told him. \"Besides, the impurities don't matter in our knot,\" Annie Said. \"The Elemental Protect Knot was co-founded with the Mondoshawan thousands of years ago. The Mondoshawan saw the day coming when the Fifth Element would leave the armor that surrounded her at the times in the temple, and would become a person with a life of her own. That's why we were created. When the Fifth Element dies, The next in her line will use our knot instead of the device at the temple…. Even though the device at the temple is part of out knot, if that makes any sense.\" \"When it was started by the humans,\" said Miguel; \"The Mondoshawan saw the advantage in it. The purpose was to serve and protect the people of Earth, so they jumped at the chance. Our 'knot' is more complex then the device at the temple.\" \"Even though in the old instruction that the Mondoshawan left us, it seems to be part of out knot,\" Annie said. \"Right,\" Miguel agreed. \"We're sort of like the Majia in 'The Mummy',\" Annie explained, only to receive blank looks from everyone else in the room, with the exception of Miguel and Omar. \"Okay… I take it no one here's even ever heard of 'The Mummy',\" She sighed. \"Annie, NO ONE's ever heard of any of your 20th/21st century movies,\" Miguel said. \"I see your point,\" Annie replied. \"So, what's this… knot?\" Korben asked. \"We're not sure. We think we've figured out how to work it. Our men are working around the clock. They've been working around the clock ever since we got the signs,\" Omar said. \"Signs?\" asked Leeloo. \"Yes, signs,\" said Omar, \"Signs that a great evil is coming.\" \"Great evil?\" Groaned Korben. \"Yeah,\" Said Annie, \"Did you think that that weird evil planet thing was the only evil that wants to take out the universe starting with Earth?\" \"Just like we are here to protect, there is a group that is here to destroy,\" Omar explained. Annie went to the bags and pulled out several scriptures, books, scrolls, stones and so on. \"They're some sort of rogue group. We don't know their name, if they even have a name,\" Annie said. \"Are they like Chaos and you like order?\" Asked Leeloo. \"No,\" Annie said harshly, \"We're talking good and evil, here! Not Chaos and order, there is a difference! Chaos is NOT evil, contrary to popular belief.\" \"Agent Lieutenant Antoinette McMorrigaul! Mind how you speak to the Fifth Element!\" Hissed Miguel loudly, cuffing Annie hardly on the back of the head. Omar fixed her with a stern look. \"I apologize,\" Annie said, yielding and bowing her head slightly, with a look of some remorse. \"I was out of line. I beg your pardons.\" Leeloo, a little taken back, nodded to show that she hadn't taken offense. \"Agent Lieutenant?\" Korben asked, unfamiliar with a term. \"We consider ourselves agents,\" Miguel said, \"agents of good, agents of life. However, we also consider ourselves a force, almost a military force. We have the same ranks as the Army, just put an Agent in front of it.\" \"I am an Agent Lt. Colonel,\" Omar said, \"I'm the senior ranking officer among us. Miguel is an Agent Major. Annie is, as you heard, an Agent Lieutenant. She's the lowest ranking of us three.\" \"Ah, I see,\" Korben said. \"Anyway,\" Omar said, gesturing to a book that Annie had laid out, \"This is a recording of our oldest scriptures. It's the oldest book we have. We think it may be the oldest book on Earth.\" \"We're still checking into that,\" Said Annie. \"It says that there is an evil that comes every 5,000 years. The dark planet. Every ten years comes a new evil. After the coming of two dark planets, another will come, later. Somewhere between ten to twenty years. When he two moons of Earth are in the three positions relative to Earth and the sun, it will signal the coming of the new Evil. A power source will come, the servants will awaken and like will be destroyed, starting with Green Earth,\" Omar read from the book, which was written in ancient languages. \"When Leeloo stopped the Dark Planet, it formed a second moon. It and the other moon have to be in some position. Then a power source of some sort is supposed to come, and the evil gains it's full strength, then the Earth is destroyed, and it goes into the rest of the universe,\" Annie said. \"What position?\" Korben asked. \"That's the problem,\" Miguel said, \"We don't know.\" He pointed to an illustration. \"Here,\" He said, \"Look here. The illustration. See there are three circles forming an upside down triangle. Then below the tip is another circle. Between that circle and the circle at the top of the triangle is a last one. We don't know what it means,\" He continued, pointing to each one. \"We think that the three circles forming the triangle are moons. But we only have two moons. We haven't a clue what the others are.\" \"Why not contact the Mondoshawan?\" Father Cornelius asked. \"We tried,\" Said Annie, \"We can't seem to get through to them. It's as if something is blocking communications to that area of space. We sent some men to find them, but they're off the beacon. Our instruments can't seem to find their space, and we have advanced technology, courtesy of the Mondoshawan.\" \"We were also hoping you could shed some light on that,\" Miguel said, \"Have they contacted you at all?\" \"If you can't get through to them, what makes you think we can?\" Asked Korben \"We thought that they may have found away to get through. Contacting you would most likely be their top priority. Just because we can't get through doesn't mean they can't. Have you heard any word?\" Asked Omar. \"No,\" Said Leeloo. She looked at Father Cornelius, who shook his head. \"Then we have no guide,\" Said Omar, looking at the scriptures with puzzlement. \"We're stuck between a rock and a hard place,\" Said Annie, \"By our calculations, we only have a few months before we hit the 20 year dead line. Then… Check mate…\" \"What do we have to do?\" Leeloo asked. \"We were hoping you would know,\" Omar said. \"We thought that the Mondoshawan may have informed you on this, on the procedures, or on anything else along that line.\" \"The Mondoshawan have told me nothing of this,\" Leeloo informed. \"Damn,\" Annie sighed, \"The Hard place just got harder.\" \"We have to decipher the meaning of these passages and illustration. Here,\" He said, turning the page and pointing at a simple line drawing of a complex machine, \"Is the second and one of the most Important pieces to the puzzle. It says here that this is what we must use to stop the evil, for this is the last time it will come.\" \"Why would this be the last time?\" Korben asked. \"We're not sure. We think the second moon marks the last coming of this great evil,\" Annie said. \"This machine,\" Omar said, \"We don't understand it at all. In this square, in the upside down triangle, are the element signs, like on The Fifth Element's wrist. There is a circle in the middle with the symbol on it. Then there's a circle, connecting the two, an inner circle and this strange symbol here. The two side by side standing rectangles with the long one on top. There are two of them, with these strange needle-looking symbols, the three of them. This one on the left has a sun, the one in the middle has a star and a stripe and this one on the right has another sun, and two squiggles of some sort below it. Then, there is this box over here, made with the daggers and swords and four gems. These symbols, in the ancient Divine Language translate into our R, E, D, and S sound. We think they stand for the Gems. Then over here on the other side of the square at three triangles and a figure of some sort. It looks like a cat or something. We don't know. Does any of this look familiar?\" Leeloo only shook her head. \"The Mondoshawan haven't informed me on any of this. It's all new to me.\" \"Then,\" Said Annie, \"It appears the hard place got harder still.\" \"There's another problem,\" Said Miguel. \"Another one?\" Korben sighed. \"Yes,\" Said Omar, \"You are in grave danger.\" \"Well of course,\" Said Korben, cutting Omar off, \"This thing wants to destroy the planet.\" \"No, Sir, that is not what I meant, the other society I spoke of, the dark one. It means to see that the purpose of this thing is fulfilled. That means tracking down the Elemental Protect Knot, destroying the Mondoshawan and/or killing most of your family as we all stand in the way of their goal. It is unlikely that they will be able to find us let a lone kill us all, especially with as many of us as there are. It's even more unlikely that they can kill all the Monodshawan. Block them, it seems. But it's highly unlikely that they could kill them. That leaves you. There are only seven of you and you're so easy to find that you're listed in the phone book. They are all ready following you and closing in, I fear,\" Omar explained. \"Has your daughter told you of her encounter with the cab driver last night,\" Annie asked. \"Yes,\" Said Korben. \"He was one of their agents. He was meant to retrieve the your daughter. One of your family is meant to be kept alive. To witness the detraction. When the end comes, if they succeed, they will be the only things left in the universe, until the ultimate end. The ultimate end can only be stopped by the next in your line. They need someone to carry on our duties, as we will,\" Omar said. Korben and Leeloo were stunned that their daughter was in so much danger and they hadn't even realized it. \"We've got to work fast,\" Said Miguel. \"When the rest of your family gets home, we've been instructed to show you to our headquarters, if you'll come.\" \"Yes, of course,\" Said Leeloo. \"Good. We'll be able to protect you there. And once there we can figure this thing out and stop it,\" Annie said. \"We'd better get packing,\" Korben sighed. \"Take anything of value to you. Size is of no object. We're going to leave in secret, so the bad guys won't know you're not here. If you don't want to loose anything, I'd suggest taking it.\" \"How long can we expect to be gone?\" Leeloo asked. \"I don't know.

Grammar. Who cared about grammar? There was more to language than grammar. Why couldn't they just teach the basics of sentence structure and Shakespearean. That was all she needed. Why couldn't she be in her chemistry class? Or literature? Or History? Or Drama? No, it was English. At least it wasn't math. Math was the only she hated more than Grammar. Suddenly, Macha, the girl next to her, slapped a note on her desk, jarring Larrita from her thoughts. Larrita looked stunned. She only received notes from Bergita… who wasn't in her English class. She looked at the note quizzically. Who would be sending her a note? This was the one class that Bergita wasn't in with her. Sierra wasn't in it either and neither was Astralita. That left Celeste. She looked to see Celeste, who was elegant looking as usual, to but Celeste was hard at concentrating on English. Celeste was originally from Paris, so English came a little harder to her than everyone else. That, of course didn't stop her from making a perfect grade in the class... like every other class… Over achiever. Other than Celeste, who was in the class? Just Eric/ Eric wouldn't have sent her a note… Maybe she was meant to pass it a long. She squinted at it. Her name was written clearly on it. Cautiously she opened it up. It was from Bobby. She looked across the rows to see Bobby trying to pretend not to look at her and trying to pretend to be concentrating on English. She began to read it. \"Larrita, Hey, anything new happen since last night? Guess not. Anyway, Bergita has some idea about having another get together and asked me to pass it on to you. She said you never paid any attention in English class anyway. Bobby\" Larrita sighed. What a waste of her time. Bergita had a phone. Why not have asked her during something else. Bergita was plotting something, she had some agenda. She began to write a reply when the intercom snapped on. \"Mrs. Salgraz?\" The nasally voice of the assistant secretary called. \"Yes?\" The stuffy old lady teacher stopped in mid-sentence to reply, \"How can I help you?\" \"Do you have a Larrita Dallas in your class?\" The voice asked. Larrita's head snapped up in surprise at hearing her name. After the shock wore off, she wondered what she had done this time. \"Yes I do,\" Said the teacher, eyeing Larrita, who she knew could be a maverick at times. \"Please send her down to the office to check out,\" The voice responded. \"Yes, I will,\" Said the teacher. No one needed to tell Larrita. She'd heard and was all ready packing, delighted to be saved from another half-hour of English. Before the teacher could even turn around to order her out, Larrita was all ready making her way towards the door. Larrita made her way down to the office. When she got there she opened the door and saw her Father standing there with two other men. One was Hispanic looking and the other black. They both looked like they'd been through the mud. \"Hi Dad,\" She said, \"What'd I do this time?\" \"Nothing,\" Replied Korben,\" We've got to go. We have to leave now?\" \"Okay,\" Said Larrita, \"Where are we going?\" \"I'll tell you later,\" Korben said. \"Who are they?\" Larrita asked. \"I'm Omar, and this is Miguel.\" \"Lovely,\" Larrita replied, as she followed them out. They entered her Father's car. Omar and Miguel automatically headed for the back seat. \"Would you like me to take your back pack for you?\" Miguel offered. \"No… thanks…\" Larrita said, just slightly off kilter as she slid into the front passenger's seat. Korben drove even faster than usual. \"Dad… what's up?\" Larrita asked, genuinely concerned. \"It'll take a while to explain,\" Said Korben, as he steered his way to a strange, large looking ship.[Chapter 5] A/N: In case there is any confusion, \"Larrita\" is pronounced \"La-Rita\" and Bergita is \"Ber-Gita\".

It looked to be twice the size of their apartment. As Larrita looked around, she noticed they were all a little outside of the city limits. Korben steered into the ship and docked. Miguel and Omar were out of the back as soon as the engine cut off. Omar rushed to get the door for Korben, and Miguel got the door for Larrita and offered her a hand to help her out. Larrita was worried that by not accepting it, se's offend him or something and right now she didn't think that was a good idea until she had the faintest idea what the hell was going on. She reluctantly accepted his hand as he helped her out. Before she thought to grab her backpack, Miguel had all ready gotten it. \"This way,\" Omar said, showing Korben and Larrita in one of the rooms on the ship. Larrita looked around the ship, taking everything in. It was larger on the inside than it looked. Inside the room was even more amazing; it looked like a living facility. She was physically taken aback. Inside the room looked like much of the furniture from their apartment. Her mother was sitting in a chair, clutching Larrita's infant siblings tightly. Robby and Amy were cuddling next to their mother, also confused. \"Wha… Huh… how?\" Larrita began. She saw boxes and crates were also around. Some strange decorations and furniture were also about. \"Larrita, I'm so glad we found you,\" Sighed Leeloo, smiling. \"What the hell is going on?!\" Larrita exclaimed, her voice breathy. Before anyone could explain, a rugged, beat-to-hell-six-ways-and-dragged-back-through-hell-backwards looking girl rushed in. \"The gang all here?\" Annie asked. \"Yeah,\" Miguel answered. \"Right. Miguel or Omar, either one, it doesn't matter, I need someone on the pilot deck with me. Someone else needs to stay here with these guys. Honored Guests, grab a side, buckle your safety belts and hold on to something. Usually I'd be able to give you a smooth ride, but we're going to be cloaked and were using new porting technology, so it's going to be rough. I hope no one had a big lunch,\" She said. \"Who... who the hell are you?\" Larrita asked, dazed. \"We'll get to that later, right now, you need to get into one of the flight seats,\" Annie said. \"Woah, woah, woah,\" Said Korben, \"You're going to be driving us?\" \"Yeah,\" Said Annie. \"You're drunk,\" Said Korben. \"I'm sober,\" Said Annie, \"I haven't touched anything in two and a half days.\" \"Like that makes me feel any better,\" Said Larrita, her caustic attitude returning now that the shock was starting to wear off. \"I'll be with her on pilot deck,\" Miguel said. \"Like Larrita said,\" Korben muttered. \"Annie, Miguel, get to Pilot deck. I'll get our guests strapped in and ready for flight,\" Omar said, calmly and Miguel and Annie turned to leave.

Larrita was glad that shernhadn't had lunch yet. The black man she'd come to know as Omar seemed not tornmind, sitting steady as a rock. Her father seemed more or less all right withrnride, but even he made smart comments about the driving. Her mother also seemedrnto hold her own, but Larrita and her siblings were going through Hell. Robbyrnlooked like he was going to be sick. After a while the ride smoothed out. Thernintercom clicked on. \"Hey, this is your pilotrnspeaking,\" Annie's voice came over the intercom. \"Shut up, Annie,\" Miguelrnhissed. \"Sorry, just always wanted tornsay that,\" Annie apologized. \"Look, folks, sorry 'bout the roughrnride. We're currently a little over ten miles out of the atmosphere, in orbitrnaround the second moon while we check in. We should be here for about two orrnthree hours, then we're going to the headquarters in Salisbury, England. Enjoyrnwhat time you have here. Take only a few things with you to the headquarters,rnthough, the rest of your stuff's safe up here… at least until the end of thernuniverse… but think Positive! That's not going to happen because we're going tornstop it… at least right now anyway…\" \"What the HELL is she talkingrnabout?\" Asked Larrita \" If you have any questions,rnask Omar, and he'll be sure to accommodate you. Miguel and I are gonna do thernstandard check-ins, then put the ship on auto-pilot, after which we'll be downrnto see to you guys. Have a nice stay. Pilot out.\" \"All right,\" Said Larrita,rnturning to Omar, \"I'm assuming you're Omar. I have questions and I'mrnasking. What the hell is going on here?\" \"That,\" Omar stated,rn\"Is a far more intricate question than you may suspect.\" \"Right…\" Said Larritarnafter Omar had finished had explaining everything to her, \"Let me makernsure I have this straight. So there's this ancient evil out there and these twornorganizations. You, the…. Elemental Protect Knot and this other unnamedrnorganization.xa0 You're good, they'rernevil. They're going to try to destroy the universe except for themselves andrnone member of our family…?\" Larrita said. Omar nodded. \"More or less,\" He said. \"And they tried to kidnap mernthat night I went to the movies?\" Larrita asked. \"Yes,\" Replied Omar. \"I think my brain is going tornexplode,\" Said Larrita dryly. \"You get used to that,\"rnAnnie's voice came from across the room as she and Miguel entered, \"Thernfeeling passes eventually.\" \"Right… and you two are?\"rnLarrita asked. \"I'm Agent LieutenantrnAntoinette McMorrigaul, but you can call me Annie,\" Annie offered her handrnfor Larrita to shake, \"And this is…\" Annie started to introducernMiguel, but he cut her off. \"Agent Major MiguelrnMartinez,\" Miguel offered a hand for Larrita to shake. \"Wonderful, now… can someonernbring me up to speed on what we're doing?\" Larrita asked. \"We've just checked in withrnthe base on the moon, you can deposit your stuff here then we're taking you tornhead quarters in a few hours where we're going to work on the little problemrnthat I assume Omar has briefed you on and keep you safe,\" Annie said. \"Where're the HeadrnQuarters?\" Asked Larrita \"Salisbury, England,\"rnReplied Miguel. \"Why didn't we just gornstraight there?\" Larrita asked. \"Well, you see, there's arnproblem with the cloaking device,\" Annie said. \"Oh?\" Responded Larrita. \"Yes, you see, it's ratherrntricky. The only way we can get the piece of junk to work is if we fly in arnstraight, vertical ascension from our position on Earth to the moon, and stayrnin the direct shadow of them moon, once we lock on that position. I don't know,rnI never could figure it out, I'm just going on what the boys at HQ tellrnme,\" Annie said, \"It was the only thing we could get working inrntime.\" \"The Cloaking device we havernuses the lunar shadow to reflect light some how…\" Miguel stated. \"The general lack ofrninformation here is really comforting,\" Korben muttered. \"Actually,\" Said Miguel,rn\"This time it's not Annie's fault. It was a really bad briefing.\" \"I had to come up here byrnmyself before the mission to figure out how to work the damn thingrnmyself,\" Sighed Annie. \"What, essentially do you all…rnDO?\" Larrita asked. \"I'm the Engineeringrnspecialist, combat expert, camo expert, and Special Ops expert. Omar does allrnthe diplomacy and talking, as well as he's the medical expert, and trained inrnseveral survival skills… and Annie's just sort of… there,\" Miguelrnexplained. \"I'm the translator, survival,rnand cultural expert, I'm also very frequently a fighter or pilot,\" Anniernglared at Miguel with a glare that would have fried an egg. \"She's also the resident drunkrnand caffeine addict,\" Miguel threw in. Annie narrowed her eyes, stillrnglaring at Miguel, and let out a low, rumbling growl. \"And you're the residentrnhot-dogging jerk,\" She replied. \"Translator? As in languagesrnor Ancient runes?\" Larrita asked. \"Both,\" Replied Annie,rn\"I'm fluent in several current, dead, modern, ancient, Human and Alienrnlanguages.\" \"Languages is the only thingrnshe's really good at other than getting into fights, and all fighting abilityrnstops there,\" Said Miguel \"I can fight,\" Anniernsaid. \"You can take on LightrnWeights,\" Miguel said, noting her short height and petite size. \"I just don't use bruternforce,\" Annie Retorted, \"Unlike Some people who only think with theirrnmuscles.\" \"At least I'm not anrnaddict,\" Miguel turned and glared. \"I'm an Alcoholic and Caffeinernaddict and still can out think you on withdrawal,\" Annie said, trying tornkeep her temper in check. \"Agent Lieutenant! AgentrnMajor! Stop it the both of you,\" Snapped Omar. Annie, unhappy to walk awayrnfrom a fight, reluctantly backed off, as did Miguel. \"With all that hangsrnin the balance the last thing we need is you childish bickering!\" Omarrnwent on, glaring at them both with a glare that topped Annie's by a ten fold. \"He started it,\" MumbledrnAnnie before she could stop herself. \"I don't care WHO[Chapter 7] A/N: In case there is anyrnconfusion, \"Larrita\" is pronounced \"La-Rita\" and Bergita isrn\"Ber-Gita\".

Let me guess… another old Earth Ref,\"rnMiguel shook his head. \"You'rern100 percent right… you get a cookie and a gold star,\" Annie replied. \"What'srnthe damage report?\" Miguel sighed. \"Well,rnI got good news and bad news,\" Annie replied, looking over the diagnostics thernship's computer was handing her. \"Ohrnno,\" Miguel sighed. \"Therngood news is that we took minor damage, the bad news is that what damage we didrnget, we too our main engines, thrusters and cloaking device. They're stillrnfunctioning but not well,\" Annie said. \"Soundsrnto me like they were trying to disable us,\" Said Miguel. \"That'srnthe interpretation I got, but they didn't make any attempt to go at ourrnweapons. There's not a scratch on them,\" Annie replied. \"So,rnthe engines and thrusters are still working,\" Miguel asked. \"Yeah,rnbarely,\" replied Annie. \"Whatrnwould you suggest?\" \"Well,rnlooking at these specs, I would say we should probably land on the base of thernmoon for repairs. I'm getting some reports in from the base, saying that theyrntook some heavy damage. They didn't loose many ships; they lost mostlyrnfighters. However, pretty much every ship that went out there was damaged thernsame way as we were. Thrusters, Engines, slip stream, those sorts of thingsrnwere hit. No one lost any weapons systems,\" Annie replied. \"Thisrnis odd…\" Miguel said, rubbing his chin. \"Irnknow… There's something going down here, something about this whole thing we'rernmissing. Call me paranoid, but I don't like it,\" Annie frowned at the reports. \"Forrnonce, I've gotta agree with you in that area,\" Miguel said.xa0 \"Come on, let's go fill in Omar.\" Anniernand Miguel had just finished briefing Omar, Korben and Leeloo on the situationrnin the ship's ready room. \"So,rnthey targeted Engines but not weapons?\" Korben asked. \"Yeah,\"rnSaid Annie, \"But they shot strategically, like they were trying to disable us,rnnot destroy us. But usually, when you want to disable someone, you go for theirrnweapons, too, because they can still fire on you. They also shot for ourrncloaking devise. It's all most like they're trying to stall us.\" \"Howrnbad is the damage?\" Asked Omar \"It wasrnhit and disabled but if we get some of the geeks from a tech room to work onrnit, it should be fairly easy to repair. The damage wasn't extensive. It's thernengines and thrusters that had the most extensive damage. Even our armor is inrngood shape,\" Annie answered. \"Howrnbad is the damage there?\" Leeloo asked. \"They'rernstill functioning in the broadest sense of the term… they're not functioningrnWELL… not that they were before, mind you, but they've declined somewhat inrnperformance. I suppose if I took a wrench to it I could try to get it working,rnI don't know how much better I can make things.

I know the basics of thernengine, so I could probably work a little, but I can't guarantee you a grade Arnperformance. I would suggest taking it to the base on the moon for repairs. Letrnthe tech boys work on it, they know more about it than I do.\" \"I havernto agree. We'll see if we can get another ship from there to get you tornSalisbury. How do you feel on it?\" Omar turned to ask Leeloo and Korben. \"Sounds fine to me,\" Korbenrnshrugged. \"To me as well,\" Answered Leeloo. \"Welcome,\" Said Annie, \"To thernbeach house on the moon.\" \"What?\" Korben asked. \"Beach house on the moon?\" Larritarnlooked at Annie Quizzically. \"Old Earth Ref,\" Replied Annie. \"Okay, who saw that coming? Raisernyour hand,\" Miguel sighed, raising his hand. A young man approached the group.rnHe was, quite frankly, one of the geekiest nerds Korben had ever seen. He hadrnbraces, a face like a pizza, squinty eyes, thick glasses, greasy, raggedy hair,rna plaid shirt, a red and white polka dot tie, and striped pants with pennyrnloafers. He sniffed a few times and wiped his nose of his sleeve. \"Ah, Marvin,\" Omar greeted him,rn\"This is Korben Dallas, and his Wife, Leeloo Dallas, the Fifth Element.\" \"Uh… hi,\" Korben greeted as Marvinrngrinned and eagerly shook his hand and then turned to Leeloo and shook hers asrnwell. \"Oh…!

C'mon people, tell me you saw the hinted Alyson/Danny too! I'm gonna just reassure myself that they couldn't have an romantic shipping since Johnny was 24-ish and Aly was only 16 at the time. And if that wasn't the reason, then the writers just suck. Alyson/Danny is ssooo cute! Anyways, I'm ranting. I'm just writing this because I wanted to make an Alyson/Danny fic. That's pretty much it. So this will be a … pretty much a narration of the movie, with an Alyson/Danny ship. Now, to the story! Erm, disclaimer first. Disclaimer: I own nothing. Not even the plot. Alyson woke up that morning, in a good mood. A great mood even. Her dream of being a producer was one step closer. She was hired to be a segment producer for a new reality TV show, Best Kid Magician. She loved magic. Though she didn't believe in it, Alyson loved it. It was more of the figuring out of the tricks that she loved best. Not to toot her own horn, but Alyson liked to think of herself as a Master Puzzle Solver. Math and science were two of her favorite classes- some people thought that they were hard, but the questions in those classes all had answers. And how to get those answers was what Alyson knew best. Unfortunately, her smarts and readiness to answer questions was what set her apart from her peers. Not that Alyson didn't try to fit in…more like she just wasn't good at it. She pretended to be into lip gloss, high fashion, all that jazz, but she just couldn't keep up the character that long. Alyson wanted to be a producer, not an actor. That's what Alyson told herself when she was ostracized. Not that it helped much. Stepping out of the shower and onto her pink fuzzy bath rug, Alyson put a glob of toothpaste on her toothbrush and started brushing. Up down. Left right. She spat into the sink and started on her blonde hair. Torn between straightening it or letting it naturally curl, the time made the decision for her. \"Oh crap,\" she muttered. \"I only have half an hour before I start walking. And what should I wear?\" Alyson was very much a perfectionist. Though she picked out an outfit the night before, when she tried it on, it didn't make her appear \"producer-ish.\" Rummaging through her closet, Alyson finally decided on a pair of kakis and navy blue tank top layered under a teal sweater. Adding funky (funky good) accessories was next as a blue flower was pinned to her sweater. Bangles were forced past her hand and onto her wrist and a watch was strapped to her other wrist. After carefully applying her mascara and eye liner, swiping lip gloss on her lips, and giving an approving nod to her reflection in her mirror, Alyson was off to the studio to get her assignment. -- \"Everybody take a seat please!\" announced Mrs. McAlister. She was the head producer of the television show, and Alyson's boss. Alyson made sure to pick a seat in the front row, where she could be seen. Eagerly, Alyson beamed at Mrs. McAlister, with a notebook on her lap, pen ready to take notes. \"This is the first show in television history made completely by kid producers,\" continued Mrs. McAlister. \"And I'm sad to say that not all of you will remain with us. Only the kids that will discover the three top magicians will stay with us through the grand finale. Think you are all up for it?\" Shooting out of her seat, Alyson spoke up, \"Oh, definitely!\" \"Good,\" said Mrs. McAlister, giving Alyson an awkward smile. Glancing around the room, Alyson realized that it was a rhetorical question. She didn't mean to draw attention to herself, well, ok, she did, but only because she wanted to impress the higher ups, not because she knew that she would be the only one standing. Giggles were heard from around the room and Alyson felt stupid. Smiling dumbly, Alyson sat back down. \"Way to start, Al,\" she scolded herself. \"Thank you,\" chuckled Mrs. McAlister, obviously thinking that Alyson's action was a bit…over zealous. Looking over her shoulder, Alyson saw a cute boy behind her, smirking. She felt red. This was school all over again for her. Not even an hour in, and she was an outcast. Now who said summer was a break from school? \"Ok, before we proceed, what is the single most important rule in making television?\" asked Mrs. McAlister. Alyson knew this was not a rhetorical question. She also knew the answer. Her hand shot up. \"Oh!\" That jerk that she thought was cute was apparently a smart ass too. \"Make sure they spell your name right in the credits.\" Slightly peeved that he didn't raise his hand, Alyson was even more annoyed that Mrs. McAlister laughed at his joke. \"That's true,\" she smiled. Pointing to Alyson, she asked, \"Yes, and you are?\" Alyson beamed. \"Alyson Miller. I think the most important rule of good television is to always keep your camera rolling. \" \"Excellent. I couldn't have said it better,\" praised Mrs. McAlister. \"Actually, you did,\" admitted Alyson. \"I remembered it from a quote you gave in an interview with TV Weekly. October of 2002.\" \"Wah, well, I'm glad at least one of you came here prepared,\" replied a somewhat shocked Mrs. McAlister. Alyson smile proudly. \"Now, it is my pleasure to introduce you to someone I'm sure you are all familiar with, he is both a world renown magician and the host of our new show, please welcome, the amazing Mr. Max.\" Alyson clapped politely as Max came on stage. \"Thank you ladies and gentlemen. 100 of teen magicians between the ages of 10-16 became eligible for the show by figuring out the hidden message in this poster. It appeared on billboards, magazines, in newspaper and on the internet. Hidden somewhere on this ad is a secret message. Just out of curiosity, did any of you happen to find it?\" Max was referring to a large poster behind him. It showed a magician in a top hat and suit pulling out a white rabbit from another hat. Cards were being pulled out of the hat as well with the words, \"Search of the World's Greatest Kid Magician\" scrolled on top. In the far upper right corner, a statue with a spider web in the background was holding a book. If you didn't look closely, it could have been overlooked. Again, Alyson's hand shot up. \"Big surprise,\" muttered the guy behind her, causing the room to snicker. Choosing to ignore him, Alyson strolled up boldly on stage when she was called on. \"Well, as we all know,\" Alyson started. \"Magicians' secret to any good trick is misdirection. That means they want you to focus on something over here,\" she gestured to her left, \"when they are doing some hocus pocus over there,\" she gestured to her right. \"So, most people thought the message would be found in the magician and his trick because that's what first draws your eye, but truth is, it's the background things you need to focus on. \"The spider web in the background made me think that it would have to be found on a website. Looking closer, I noticed the statue holding the book, 'A Farewell to Arms.' Then BAM! It hit me!\" Alyson clapped her hands for emphases. \"Everyone knows that the Venus de Milo is a statue with no arms. And that made me think of the famous magician of the Magic Mansion. A magician named Antonio de Milo. I mean, how obvious could it be?\" Throwing her hands up in the air, Alyson concluded, \"I went online, typed in 'deMilo. net'and got linked directly to the entry form! Simple, right?\" Eye rolls around the room, giggles from the girls and a \"Sure\" from the jerk behind her made Alyson's smile falter. There she was, being a know it all again. \"Thank you Alyson,\" said Max, handing her a flower out of mid air. Accepting gratefully, Alyson thanked him and made her way back to her seat, aware that all eyes were on her. She knew that she wasn't the best at making friends. Coming off as a know it all was not what she tried to do, it just…happened. It wasn't her fault that everyone had questions and she just happened to have the answers. Alyson wished that she had a kid her age that she could relate to. Hell, just anyone to relate to would have been nice. But Alyson was a tough girl, she knew that she could manage by herself. And so she did. -- The next day passed as a blur. She briefly remembered being introduced to her kid camera man, Cedric, and her adult mentor, Paul. And that jerk that she happened to sit in front of was named Hunter. Thank God he wasn't on her team. Alyson gave a tiny whoop of joy. Noticing that she was still in the studio, she covered up by saying, \"I'm just so excited to get started!\" Which, in a way, was true. She had no idea what she was in for. First stop was some ice cream shop to talk to this kid \"Blake.\" More like \"fake.\" After ordering Paul to tie him up tight in a straight jack, clearly attempting to reenact one of Houdini's famous escapes, Alyson had to watch the poor kid attempt to free himself, succeeding in only making him look like a fool and causing Alyson to feel stupid. After managing to get himself stuck in a garbage can, Alyson and her team gave up on Blake and moved on to magician number two. Magician number two wasn't anyone impressive either. He had a trick with boxes with hidden compartments. Alyson thought that anyone could pull off this trick…and this kid could have too had he not gone and used his dog as his \"assistant.\" Half way through the trick, the dog stuck its head out of the bottom and spoiled the trick. So Alyson's team moved on. And on. And on. The magicians just kept getting worse. If that was even possible. There was the \"is-this-your-card\" girl, which Alyson swore she went through the deck twice still not finding her card and so she just made up her card and agreed to which ever one came up next. After that, was the \"linking rings\" girl. Then the \"my-hat-is-magic\" guy, who just managed to dump egg on Alyson's head after he forgot the main part of the trick. The rest just blurred together. One disappointment after the other. \"Impressively pathetic\" is how Alyson would have described them. Alyson was distraught. Here they were, down to their last contestant. His name was Daniel Sinclair. And he was Alyson's last hope. They reached the house at about noon. Long car rides did not help the mood of despair for Cedric and Alyson. Dragging themselves out of the car, they were greeted by two very excited parents. \"This is all Danny has been talking about for weeks. Come on in!\" invited Mr. Sinclair. All Alyson could manage was a half hearted, \"Sure, awesome, perfect, yeah,\" and then forced her feet to follow them into the house. In a way, Alyson was glad that this was the last contestant. No more pained auditions to go through, no more being the assistant to a kid that had no clue what he was doing, no more getting hopes up and having them crushed. Then again, that meant no more producing. Her career would be over before it even started. What a depressing thought. Alyson climbed the stairs to Danny's room. Knocking on his door, she entered and saw a boy blowing up a giant balloon. Tapping him on the shoulder, Alyson managed to get his attention, and caused him to lose the balloon. Bracing herself for the impact of a balloon possibly hitting her, Alyson opened her eyes and grinned sheepishly at the boy in front of her. He was cute, she could admit that. His hair was brown and cut short, but had the look that he ran his hands through it constantly, like when he was deep in thought. Eyes the color of the ocean met her deep green ones and Alyson felt…something. This guy was something. Danny smiled shyly. \"Welcome.\" Alyson smiled back, but knew that this was not the time for small talk. He was either a complete waste of time and destroyer of her career, or he was a god send. She had to find out. \"So…\" she began. \"You have any tricks to show us?\" Danny smirked and tugged on his balloon. \"Only one way to find out.\" -- Author's Note: Sorry, poop load of dialogue.

Enjoy :D Oh, and some of the crazy outfits are from the movie, since I have zero fashion sense and therefore can not make up my own. But there are one or two outfits that I didn't like, so I'm just gonna go let her wear something eh at times. Sorry in advance if the mental image sucks. . Disclaimer: I am the queen of unoriginality. I own nothing. Alyson couldn't help getting her hopes up. And she thought she was getting so good at keeping them down, but when Danny blew up a balloon, waved his hand around it three times and it popped…Alyson couldn't help but feel crushed. She spoke, hoping that her voice didn't break too badly, \"Is this the…popping balloon trick?\" \"No, no, see, what's suppose to happen is that I pop the balloon, and a dove will appear,\" explained Danny. \"I've done it a million times. Just give me another try.\" Alyson was skeptic, but she had nothing left. She motioned for Danny to try again. And again. By the fifth time, she tried to help. \"Maybe you should try a different trick?\" His rejection of her idea was almost scary. \"NO. I can do this. Just back off, give me a second.\" But Alyson didn't back down. \"Do you need help? An assistant? Different -\" \"I'm gonna do it. You just need to back off, alright?\" Danny was clearly pissed. More at himself then Alyson, but she was the one taking all the heat. Alyson calmed down. She realized something. \"This really matters to you, huh?\" He sighed. \"More then you can possibly know.\" \"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I seriously need this to happen too.\" Alyson tried not to smile. Ok, so me and him just had our \"we are both in the same boat talk.\" Now he will be able to do the trick. That's what always happened in the movies. Alyson let her hopes rise. \"You are my last chance.\" \"And you are mine,\" he admitted to her. \"So let's just do this. This time, this time it will definitely, definitely work.\" Alyson gave him a reassuring smile. But he let her down. Repeatedly. Times that by like two. Danny went through a whole package of balloons. And none produced the dove. Dejectedly, Alyson gave him a last glance, and walked out of the room. She didn't want to speak. She was doing her best to stop from crying. \"Bye kid,\" Paul said as he exited. \"But, please, wait!\" cried out Danny. \"I can do it, just give me another chance. Please…\" Cedric's parting \"Peace\" was their final words to Danny. Once they got outside, Alyson had to deal with Cedric. \"I bet the only reason we took a bajillion takes of that guy was because Alyson thought he was cute.\" Whipping around, Alyson retorted, \"The only reason we did 'a bajillion takes' was because our other nine magicians really sucked.\" Alyson was in disbelief. \"I just can't believe I'm going to be off the show.\" She kicked a rock for emphases. \"Hey now, you don't know that. One of our other magicians could still get picked,\" offered Paul. \"You seriously think so?\" questioned Alyson. \"Naw. But I'm the mentor, I have to say those kinds of things,\" laughed Paul. Alyson just glared. Paul remote opened the trunk of the car and when the back popped open, Paul, Alyson and Cedric were rushed at by birds escaping from the car. After fighting her way out of their flight path, Alyson turned to Cedric, \"Please tell me you were taping that.\" \"I'm rolling, I got it, I got it!\" cheered Cedric from behind the camera. \"Cedric, you rock!\" squealed Alyson, ecstatic from the renewed hope. \"Wow man, this kid is good!\" gushed Cedric, still taping. \"You think Danny did this?\" asked Paul, slight awe in his voice. \"Of course, who else?\" stated Alyson. She turned to the window that she knew Danny was watching from. Instead of seeing joy on his face…it was more like fear. That look was something that would eat at Alyson for a while. -- Alyson and her team hurried back to the studio. She nervously watched Max analyze the tape. Finally, he spoke. \"You are right, Alyson. Very impressive.\" Alyson and Cedric shared a high five. \"Very impressive indeed.\" \"See what I told you?\" gloated Alyson. \"Unbelievable.\" \"Ha, that's right. Unbelievable,\" sneered Hunter. \"Her and that Danny kid set it up. They've been scamming us from the start.\" \"We were not!\" \"Oh get real. There is no way he pulled that off, unless you helped,\" challenged Hunter. \"Ok, Alyson wouldn't do something like that,\" defended Mrs. McAlister. \"She knows the rules. Colluding with a contestant is an automatic disqualification.\" \"Well, we all know how much she likes to be the best at everything,\" insulted Hunter. Alyson flinched. That one brought back memories. \"I was there. And so was Paul. It was all real!\" exclaimed Cedric. \"They are on her team. Big deal. They might be as big a cheat as she is,\" accused Hunter. Alyson glared, low blow, insulting her mentor. \"Honestly, I think this Danny kid is the real deal,\" stated Paul. Max seemed to value Paul's opinion highly. \"Well then, I guess we found our last contestant.\" Alyson couldn't stop grinning even if she wanted to. -- She really did have way too many ideas for her brain. In a way, she felt bad that Danny was sitting next too her when she was like this. Alyson didn't want to scare him with being over excited, but then again, she watched all these reality TV. She knew how this worked. She was also afraid that if she stopped talking, all she would do is stare. At him. Which she would have no problem with, but Alyson bet that would have been extremely awkward for Danny. At the moment, she was currently approving of the whole \"Opps-I-failed-my-trick-act…just-kidding-here-are-doves-in-your-trunk\" act. \"That would be the perfect approach to this show. That will make the audience love you….you can come up with something like that again, right?\" asked Alyson. She nervously pulled on the strings of her gray, Thomas Edison High School hoodie. Normally, she wouldn't dress this bummy, but it was a 16 hour train ride to the Magic Mansion, and being on a train that long was not going to settle well with Alyson if she wasn't comfortable. Tugging at a string on her fashionably destroyed jeans, Alyson nudged him when he didn't reply. \"Oh, sure, sure,\" answered Danny, blowing off her question. Sighing, Alyson went on with her spiel. \"Ok then, next thing is costumes. I want some thing classy but not too flashy. Definitely not some 'all black funeral guy' look.\" Alyson was getting all excited. \"You need a … a gimmick! Flashing lights, exploding wands…\" Her idea pitch was slowed by Danny's sarcastic, \"Wow.\" Alyson wanted to pout. Danny was so not cooperating with her. And she could not seem to get his attention. Which was not the cause with Brandon, Hunter's magician. \"Hey Alyson, pick a card,\" he suggested. With a glance at Danny, who was showing interest her now, Alyson drew a card. It was the ace of hearts. She looked at it, showed it to Danny, then put it back in Brandon's deck. \"Okay, now all I want you to do is say 'jump.'\" Obediently, Alyson said, \"Jump.\" A card flew out of Brandon's deck, flipped in the air and landed in Brandon's hand. He showed her the ace of hearts. \"This your card?\" he asked smugly. \"Whoa! Wow,\" said Alyson. \"That was so cool!\" \"Yeah, that's pretty good. I think it's pretty good,\" replied Brandon with a wink. Alyson saw Danny glare. He reached across her to grab the deck, facing it towards Brandon, he ordered, \"Pick a card.\" Brandon rolled his eyes. \"You want me to pick a card? Sure.\" \"Got it memorized?\" A nod from Brandon meant he did. \"Ok, now put it back in the deck, any where.\" Brandon did what he was told. All this was happening in front of Alyson and she tried to watch Danny do his trick, to learn the secrets. She snuck a glance at him, and he winked at her before he threw the deck. Alyson watched as the jack of diamonds appeared stuck in the glass of the window of the train. Brandon seemed amazed as he had to open the window and stick his hand out to retrieve it. \"That your card?\" asked Danny, reclining back in his seat. \"That's my card!\" gasped Brandon, in disbelief. \"Oh my gosh! That was awesome!\" cheered Alyson, giving Danny a pat on the chest. \"Dang, you are super good!\" Danny had gone back to his detached mood and was just gazing out the window. Alyson sighed. \"You know, this whole, 'mopey, droopy' thing you have going on is just not going to work for TV. Too boring.\" Alyson was met with an eye roll. She faced him and drew her legs up to her chair and rested her chin on her knees. \"You don't want to get in the habit of rolling your eyes. It will give you problems later.\" Her only answer was Danny shutting off the light and plunging them into darkness. -- Alyson hated the TV whoevers that made them take the train. Maybe it was cheaper, but it sure was uncomfortable. Alyson had tried a number of positions to sleep in, all of them failing her. Fact about Alyson. She was NOT a person that could manage without sleep. She needed her 10 hours of sleep or there would be hell to pay. At the moment she was up to 2 hours of sleep. If Danny thought she was unbearable now, just wait until the morning, he'll be wishing she was acting like last night. Why did she ever let him convince her into giving up her window seat? Letting her eyes adjust to the light, Alyson looked at Danny. He was leaning against the window, breathing smooth and easy. He had to be asleep. Glancing around, she realized that everyone else was asleep. Everyone but her. She let out a groan. She was desperate. Checking one last time at the room, Alyson leaned her head on Danny's shoulder, and let sleep take her. -- The movement was what woke her, but Alyson refused to open her eyes. \"Five more minutes,\" she mumbled before snuggling deeper into the…wait. Alyson woke up. She found herself curled into her seat with both her arms wrapped around Danny's. Apparently, she was snuggling into his shoulder. Detangling herself from him, Alyson looked up to find Danny staring out the window. Secretly thankful that she did not drool in her sleep, Alyson fixed herself so that she was sitting normally in her chair. Everyone else appeared to be asleep still. \"Um…sorry…\" was all that Alyson could manage to say. She felt lame. And embarrassed. \"It's cool.\" Danny was detached which made Alyson slightly annoyed. She could not get an emotion out of this guy! \"How far are we?\" she asked. \"Still a bit. You can go back to sleep,\" suggested Danny, though moving tilting his body away from her and pretending to be very interested in the outside world. Alyson just got blown off. Ouch. Though it happened to her a lot, especially at school, it never seemed to sting any less. \"I'm just going to walk around.\" Stretching, Alyson got up. Her limbs hurt from the awkward position she slept in. She toyed with the idea of inviting Danny but she just stopped. \"You are wel- … nevermind.\" If he heard her, he didn't look like it. Alyson knew that he wouldn't have accepted anyways. Stupid anti-social cute broody boys. Alyson really had a reason for getting up-nature was calling. She hurried past their car to the next. And then the next. And still nothing. Alyson was getting worried. And she could find zero people to ask. Figures. After the third time of hurrying past his seat, Danny asked, \"What are you doing?\" Torn between acting like he wasn't there, since that seemed to be what he did with her until she got on his nerves, and really needing the bathroom, Alyson managed to say, \" I have to use the bathroom super super super bad…and I can't find one! Like at all!\" Alyson was almost at the point where she'd have to cross her legs and do the bathroom dance, but she couldn't helped but smile when Danny let out a small bark of laughter. Shaking his head, he got up and led her to two cars in front of theirs to a bathroom off in the corner. Rushing past him, Alyson made it to the bathroom just in time. Exiting, she had to give him a smile of thanks. \"You, Daniel Sinclair, are my hero.\" Danny was leaning again a wall on the opposite side of the bathroom, which reassured Alyson that he could not hear her in the bathroom. \"Well then,\" he gave her a wolfish grin. \"Why don't you buy your hero some food? I'm starving.\" Lightly punching him in the arm, Alyson couldn't help but grin back. \"Fine. But let's not be pricey.\" -- Alyson's eyes widened when she saw the amount of food piled up on Danny's tray. There was enough there for three whole meals. Noticing her look, Danny explained, \"I'm a growing boy, I need my food.\" Danny made it up to Alyson though. She didn't have to pay for anything, and he even bought her a blueberry muffin, just for her. She was amazed by his transformation. Here was the boy that was a mopey, anti-social pain in the butt only hours before, and then now, here he was, making Alyson actually enjoy his company. She took the time to exam Danny. He wore the bed head look well. And he really did have a cute smile. Alyson remembered when he grinned at her. A girl could melt from it. \"So, it's a wonder what a good night's sleep can do to someone's crabbiness,\" joked Alyson as she picked at her blueberry muffin. \"Well don't get used to it,\" warned Danny. \"Once we are off this train and I can distance myself from you guys, then I will.\" Alyson mentally hit herself. She totally killed the mood. Her smile faltered and she lost her eye contact with Danny, acting more interested in her muffin then him. She was an idiot. Attempting to regain the friendliness that they had before, Alyson offered, \"Here, let me pay for my muffin.\" \"No, think of it as a gift. That's the only thing I'm ever going to get you,\" replied Danny sharply. A few seconds later, Danny put his dishes away and walked back to his seat, leaving Alyson behind with her muffin. \"Thanks,\" answered Alyson meekly. Yup, Alyson definitely effed up that time. -- By the time Alyson returned to her seat, Danny had on his iPod and was gazing out the window. Sighing Alyson happened to make eye contact with Brandon, and was forced to spend the remainder of the train trip \"picking cards.\" She was suddenly agreeing that this whole \"gimmick\" idea was a bad idea. And she was thankful that Danny didn't use them, because if she had to \"pick a card\" one more time, Alyson was sure that she would \"jump.\" -- They were suppose to arrive at the mansion around noon the next day, but a \"technical difficulty\" kept them on longer. Much longer. So that meant more awkward silence with Danny. Alyson really hated trains. Finally, the train arrived at the train station, and the trek to the Magic Mansion started. And pretty much ended. After a five minute drive, the teens were dropped off at the end of a long driveway. Alyson walked up it in awe. The mansion itself seemed to be old; the odd light on here and there made the house seem even eerier. The dark night sky help aid the house with it's mysterious look. Ivy grew tall along the fence and walls and the yard seemed to be full of night wild life. A hoot from an owl made Alyson jump. Entering, they were greeted by Max. Dressed in his normal black attire, Max smiled. \"Welcome to the Magic Mansion. And congratulations to our three finalists on making it this far in the competition.\" \"It's a real honor to meet you,\" greeted Zoe, the third kid magician as she shook Max's hand. \"I'm Zoe.\" \"And I'm Brandon,\" beamed Brandon, also extending his hand. Danny rolled his eyes and frowned, not impressed with Brandon. When Max held out his hand to Danny, Danny shook it. \"I'm Danny.\" \"Yes, I've been looking forward to meeting you, Danny,\" replied Max, a twinkle in his eye. Letting go of Danny's hand, Max turned to the group. \"I'd like for you all to think of this as your home. Follow me.\" Danny threw a backwards glance at Alyson and smiled when he met her eyes. She smiled back, noticing how excited to be here he was. And how could he not? In the front room alone, there were three other magicians, practicing their tricks. The room itself was beautiful; decorated in antique circus furniture and yet giving off a magical aura. \"In all it's history, a very few people have been allowed in the Magic Mansion,\" lectured Max. \"That's because every secret known to man and then some are hidden beneath these walls. For the remainder of this competition, you can use any prop, any book, any object, any illusion we have, and I suggest you take advantage of it. Remember, you never know how strong your magic is…until you test it.\" Max started to walk away, but then turned back to the group. \"Oh, and one more thing- you might want to search your pocket for your room keys.\" All around the room, the kids checked their pockets. Allison found hers and squealed, looking over at Danny to see his face all confused. He was checking his pockets, and appearing to have found nothing. \"Oh, Danny,\" smirked Max. He made a flick of his wrist and a key appeared in his hand. Tossing the key to Danny, Max left the group. \"Eep!\" squealed Alyson, squeezing Danny's shoulders. Just because he said that he wasn't going to be her friend, doesn't mean that she wouldn't be his. Plus, she wasn't that easy to get rid of. Her and Danny had a moment of friendship once, they could have it again. Alyson was sure of it. -- Heading to their rooms, Alyson told Danny her game plan. \"Ok, here's how it is, Danny. From here on out, you and I are gonna be like this.\" She crossed her middle and index fingers and held them up to his face. \"I wanna know everything about you: what you are doing and what you are thinking 24 hours a day, everyday.\" \"Right now, I'm thinking that this is my room,\" answered Danny, pointing to a door. Alyson nodded. At least he was following the plan. \"So?\" \"So I guess I'll see you tomorrow,\" answered Danny. He entered, and Alyson did too. \"Now wait a minute,\" she dropped her bags. \"We aren't done talking here.\" Danny's face came close to hers, causing her to take a step back. \"Well one of us is.\" He tried to shut the door, but Alyson had her hand against it, forcing it open. \"You are blocking my door.\" \"So?\" Alyson tilted her head. She was determined to make some sort of head way with him. \"So can we continue this tomorrow please? I kinda have things I need to take care of,\" stated Danny, voice straining to remain calm. \"What kind of things?\" asked Alyson, still refusing to move. \"None of your business.\" Alyson took a deep breath. \"Danny, I don't think you are getting it. Everything about you here IS my business. My business is to follow your every move.\" Looking towards the Cedric, Danny asked the camera, \"Who is this girl?\" Cedric shrugged. Danny sighed. \"Look. I've watched like a gazillion hours of these shows. Even the really gross ones where they have to eat larva and dive into-\" \"Well what's your point?\" cut off Danny. It was Alyson's turn to sigh. \"The contestants that get the most screen time are the ones who are wildly charismatic, extremely competitive and have usually overcome some type of heartbreaking obstacle.\" \"Right now, the only heart breaking obstacle in my life is you!\" snapped Danny. \"C'mon, please!\" begged Alyson. She perked up. \"We're a team!\" \"Oh yeah? Well then, how about a team cheer?\" suggested Danny. Alyson smiled. \"Go team, GO!\" And with that last word, Danny shut the door in Alyson's face. Alyson turned to find Cedric laughing. And still recording. Her glare shut him up. Pounding on the door, Alyson shouted, \"Danny? Come on, open up!\" To her surprise, it did. \"Look, there are things about me you are not going to understand no matter how much we talk, so how about we make a deal? I promise I will do whatever I can to win this for you as long as the rest of the time, you leave me alone,\" stated Danny. When he saw Alyson try to say something, he shut the door. In her face. Again. Stomping off to her own room, Alyson realized something. Daniel Sinclair was a puzzle, and they didn't call her the Puzzle Master for nothing. -- Author's Note: Ok, plot moving kinda. I added the train sleeping scene just because. -shrug- Let me know how you all feel. And I replaced all the \"SaintClair's\" with \"Sinclair\" since I was spelling his last name wrong .[Chapter 3] Author's Note- G'ah, I'm finding it hard to not do what I normally do; which is rushing to the action and ignoring the plot. So please, put up with my slow development of the story. I'm trying to not have any gaps where you guys are like \"wah?\" So yeah. To the story! Disclaimer- Yeah, yeah. I own nothing. Blah blah blah. The next morning Alyson woke up early, intending to pry into Danny's life and develop some theories. Unfortunately for her, Danny didn't come down for breakfast. In fact, she didn't see him until about 15 minutes before Max's meeting was to begin. When Danny walked in, Alyson waved her hand in the air wildly. \"Here Danny! I saved you a spot!\" Alyson patted the seat next to her and beamed when Danny grudgingly rolled his eyes, but came and sat next to her. \"Good morning, Sleepyhead! You missed breakfast.\" Danny slouched in his seat, resting his foot on the seat in front of him. His head rested on the hand farthest from Alyson, and Alyson could almost see the gears in his head, debating whether to keep ignoring her or to acknowledge her. Finally, he turned towards her. \"I don't eat breakfast.\" Alyson clicked her tongue at him. \"Tisk tisk Danny. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! In fact-\" She was cut off by Max, who just now entered on stage. He smiled at her, causing Alyson to blush and stop talking, muttering a weak, \"I'm sorry.\" Alyson saw Hunter smirk. Sighing at herself, Alyson shook her head and focused on Max. \"My mentor, and the founder of this mansion, Antonio de Milo was once asked, 'What is a magician's greatest asset?' and he replied, 'A-\" Max was cut off by Danny. \"A magician's greatest asset is the ability to think in unusual ways,\" stated Danny. Alyson beamed at him. He rolled his eyes at her. \"Well that was very good,\" said Max, clearly impressed. \"And yes, the ability to think in unusual ways. Which is the grounds for our first challenge. Watch carefully.\" Max stood on stage. \"You'll have a basketball.\" He held out his hand, and caught a basketball out of thin air. Alyson inhaled sharply. Her reaction was not alone. \"Wow's\" were heard from around the room. \"A rope.\" Max pulled a rope from out of his fist. \"A broom, a 10 gallon aquarium and…a bed sheet.\" With a wave of his hand, a bed sheet floated on top of the items. The room clapped, impressed with his act. \"Five very different yet common household items. And you have exactly 30 minutes to create an illusion using any or all of these items.\" Brandon raised his hand. \"Just those things and nothing else?\" \"Just those things, and nothing else,\" confirmed Max. He stepped off stage. \"And the clock is ticking.\" The other two magicians hurried on stage, while Danny just sat on the side. Alyson let him think for 15 minutes, but then she started getting worried when the other two were actually getting their projects started and near completion. Walking over to Danny's step, Alyson decided to step in. \"So Danny…Now that you have done all this intense, but not-very-interesting-to-watch thinking, is there anything you want to just hop up and show us? Anything you wanna try? Maybe a charming but futile first attempt?\" Alyson shook his arm to make sure he wasn't falling asleep. \"Anything?\" Danny just glared at her. \"Have I mentioned that you are kinda really making this hard for me to concentrate?\" It was Alyson's turn to roll her eyes. \"Ok,\" she pointed her finger at him, clearly getting pissed. \"Maybe you have never watched much TV, but as I said before, it has to be active, it has to be captivating, it has to be- what are you doing?\" During Alyson's speech, Danny just got up and walked off stage. \"I can't do this.\" Alyson hurried after him. \"What do you mean!? You can't mean that. You have to do this.\" Danny suddenly turned on Alyson, almost causing her to crash into him. \"I should have never came here in the first place. Especially not if I knew I'd end up with you!\" Once again, the painful memories of school came back. She snapped back at him, equally as angry as he was. \"You know, you might want to clue me in. What is this really about? Is it stage fright? Are you freaked out about having to perform in front of a bunch of cameras? If you are, I totally understand. Just tell me and we can figure out a way to work on it.\" Alyson had managed to calm down during her spiel, but Danny still was in a bad mood. \"It's not stage fright!\" \"Then what?!\" retorted Alyson. \"I'm only trying to help.\" \"Yeah, well you can't!\" snapped Danny. \"You know,\" sighed Alyson. \"I'm not the enemy here. Cedric and I are your friends.\" She gestured to them both. \"Right Cedric?\" Turning, Danny and Alyson found Cedric falling asleep behind his camera. \"Cedric?!\" Snapping her fingers in his face, Alyson woke him up. \"Attention please, thanks.\" \"Huh?\" Cedric woke up groggily. \"I was trying to assure Danny that he has whatever support he needs because you and I are…here for him.\" \"Yeah, uh, for sure,\" replied back Cedric. He gave them a sheepish smile. Alyson had to force a smile on her face. And she knew it looked that way. Turning back to Danny she answered, \"See?\" \"Great. Well now that we've established that. Let's just cut the chitter chatter so I can focus on my trick.\" During this last sentence, Danny had grabbed Alyson's arms and squeezed to makes sure that she was paying attention to him. Cedric had turned back towards the stage and didn't notice Alyson's wince of pain. But Danny did. He immediately let her go. \"Ok, uh, good.\" Alyson rubbed her arms and turned to go back on stage. Danny reached on and grabbed her hand. \"Alyson, I'm really sorry. It's just…there are some things I can't tell you.\" He hung his head in shame. Alyson felt his hand slipping out of hers and entwined their fingers, keeping him near. Tilting his chin up, she offered, \"You can try to tell me, you know?\" She gave him a small smile. Smiling back, Danny shrugged. \"Maybe another time. I kinda have to get going on this challenge.\" He let go of her hand and went back on stage to prepare for his trick. Watching him walk around the items, Alyson smiled to herself. Minor victory for Alyson. -- Alyson went back to her seat and waited patiently for the challenge to end and the acts to begin. Finally, Danny plopped into the seat next to her. She gave him a smile which he returned, but it didn't look confident. Her question was cut off by Max. \"Hundreds have tried, only three have survived,\" stated Max. \"And now the stakes get even higher. Three kids. Seven days. Only one winner. Who would be the next greatest kid magician?\" Eager to watch the acts, Alyson wished Max would finish his speech faster. She also realized that she was going to have to hear this speech about a hundred more times before the show was over. Stupid reality TV and having to repeat their awesome prices at every possible moment. Challenge number one started off with Zoe. She used only the bed sheet and the basketball and possibly the rope, Alyson wasn't sure. But Zoe managed to levitate the basketball around her body and nab herself a seven out of a possible ten score from Max. Alyson gulped for Danny, who just happened to be next. \"So, what are you going to do?\" asked Alyson, turning to Danny. He sighed. \"Not a clue.\" Alyson glared. \"I'm not laughing.\" \"Good,\" Danny leaned forward. \"Cause neither am I.\" He patted a shocked Alyson's leg before heading up to the stage. \"Um…a fish tank,\" stated Danny. He brought it to the middle of the stage. \"A broom. –\" \"Yeah, yeah. A rope, bed sheet and a basketball. We know the items. Show us the trick!\" sneered Brandon. Danny glared at him and looked like he was going to say something, but Max cut in. \"Let's just watch.\" Holding up the bed sheet to cover the items, Danny turned back to the crowd. \"They are going to, uh, disappear.\" \"Yeah right!\" shouted Hunter. \"You don't stand a snow ball's chance in summer pulling that trick off.\" Smirking, Danny answered, \"Oh yeah? Just watch and be amazed. One…\" Alyson found herself counting along with him. \"Two. Three.\" Danny dropped the bed sheet…to find out that he managed to fill the fish tank with snow, packed so tightly around the broom that it stood straight up, with the rope attached to the basketball, spinning it around the broom. Everyone was shocked. Alyson was too. She looked at Danny and saw a mix of fear and disappointment on his face. \"Very impressive. That's truly original,\" stated Max. \"Uh, thanks,\" answered Danny. Surprise was evident on his face, though he tried to play it off. Hunter had something to say though. \"But nothing disappeared! What's with that white stuff?\" Danny reached around into the aquarium. \"It's snow. It's real snow!\" Amazed by it, he had to smile. \"Hey Hunter! Catch!\" Danny lobbed Hunter a snowball. Catching it ungracefully, Hunter got up. \"Wait. You said the contestants could only use the five original items. Snow is not one of them.\" Standing up, Alyson came to Danny's defense. \"That's ridiculous. That was a great trick! The best I've ever seen!\" \"That doesn't matter,\" snapped Hunter. \"Rules are rules!\" Hunter turned to Max. \"Only the original five objects. That's what you said.\" \"Yes, the rules were to think in unusual ways, which you have done Danny, but it was while using only the originally five objects. So I'm going to give you a three.\" Max held up the card. Alyson's face fell. Danny just looked pissed off. \"Yes!\" cried out Hunter. Sighing at his weird whatever that he manage to make, Danny dodged out of the way as the basketball broke off the rope, into Brandon's hands. Max nodded, signaling that it was Brandon's turn. \"If it is ok, I would like to use an assistant?\" asked Brandon, winking at Alyson. She rolled her eyes. Max nodded. \"Danny's right there. Use him.\" Brandon looked towards Hunter for help, but seeing as he wasn't going to get any, made his way to the stage. \"I call this trick, 'Clean Sweep.'\" He pretend to sweep Danny out of the way. Alyson noticed that Danny's eyes were looking blacker. \"Now Danny, hold this sheet up like a curtain.\" Danny did as he was told, but not happily. \"Alright Danny, could you raise it up a bit more.\" \"You know, technically I'm not one of the five original items,\" teased Danny, tone light but eyes dark. \"Just raise the sheet, ok? Don't be a freak,\" suggested Brandon, giving Danny a look while attempting to smile for the camera. \"And now, for the most amazing feat you have ev-\" His words where cut off. Alyson glanced around worriedly. Some thing was not right. \"Brandon? Brandon?\" asked Danny, slowly lowering the sheet. He let it drop, showing the crowd that he was gone. Murmurs were heard through out the crowd, but then they rose to their feet, clapping. Alyson noticed Danny exchange a look with Max, but then her attention turned in the opposite direction. There was Brandon, shrieking his little head off, strapped to the spinning circle where the magicians throw their trick knives. He was still holding his broom. Alyson knew something was not right. Why would Brandon be screaming if he knew that this was going to happen? Wasn't it part of his trick? And why was Danny looking so scared? Hunter started clapping again. When he turned to Max, a ten was in his hand. So Brandon and Hunter were in the lead, then Zoe, then Danny. Another look was exchanged between Danny and Max, and then Danny ran off stage. Alyson followed. \"Danny, would you slow down? What happened back there?\" asked Alyson, slightly out of breath. Still heading away from her, Danny answered, \"It's Brandon's trick, ask him.\" \"I saw..\" \"Saw what?\" \"I think you are hiding something,\" stated Alyson. \"Yeah? Well you are wrong.\" \"Are you ever going to let me in? If something is going on, maybe I can help!\" offered Alyson. Danny turned on her. \"Thanks, but no thanks. I need to sort this out myself.\" Alyson sighed. \"You know, things would be a lot easier if we weren't always in combat mode with each other! I can't be your friend if you don't give me to work with.\" Danny wouldn't meet her eyes. \"Look…I know I come on kinda strong sometimes. And maybe, well I know I have gotten kinda caught up in trying to figure you out, but I have a feeling we might really like each other if we'd just give the friendship a chance.\" Danny looked like he listened, but didn't care. \"OK!\" he answered, clapping his hands. Then, he turned and entered the hall of mirrors. Entering after him, Alyson asked, \"Can't we try calling a truce for a minute or two?\" \"Sure, why not?\" \"Wait, so how did Brandon end up on that wheel?\" asked Alyson, desperately lost. \"I dunno,\" answered Danny, choosing his path. \"You are the puzzle solver. Why don't you tell me?\" And with that, Danny left Alyson in a maze of mirrors, while he escaped somewhere far away from her. -- Determined to find out what happened earlier that day, Alyson recruited Cedric into helping her discover Brandon's trick. Grabbing a pair of flashlights, the two wandered on stage. \"He was here, right? We just need to find the trap door. There has got to be a trap door.\" \"How should I know? Can't we do this in the morning?\" Cedric's voice quivered. Alyson hunted around the stage with Cedric trailing after her. She thought she heard him whimper. \"Uh, Cedric, this may go faster if we split up.\" \"This place really creeps me out,\" stated Cedric. \"And I don't see a trap door.\" \"Me neither,\" replied Alyson. \"But there has to be one. There is no way he could have done that trick with no trap door.\" \"Who cares how Brandon did the trick? I mean, it's past curfew, it's dark. We are gonna get caught!\" \"Shhh!\" ordered Alyson as she pushed Cedric behind a curtain. \"Someone is coming.\" Noticing that it was Hunter and Brandon, Alyson came out of hiding. \"Hi guys.\" The boys flinched from the light. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Same thing you are; admiring the fine work of the floorboards. Pretty cool trick you did this afternoon.\" \"Sometimes I even amaze myself,\" grinned Brandon. She wasn't swayed. \"Sure you do. There's no trap door.\" \"Uh, yeah. So?\" Flashing her light in his face, Alyson answered, \"Let's just say, I have no idea how your trick went off. But I know it wasn't you.\" \"Okay, so prove it,\" dared Brandon. \"Maybe I will,\" answered Alyson calling his bluff. Turning towards the exit, Alyson made her leave. Author's Note- So the plot moves on! And I think in the next chapter I'll get to this one part I'm super excited about writing, but my neighbor just died, so I have the wake and funeral to go to, then I have to tutor two days this week and long story short, I may get busy. But only one person is reading this story anyways. . so sorry, LazuliteRose, the next update might not be for a bit. uf04c[Chapter 4] Author's Note- Ok, attempting to squeeze one out before my schedule gets too insane. Disclaimer- I own only the modifications to the scenes. Alyson managed to sneak back into her room with no difficulties. She kinda liked sneaking around; it made her feel like a real movie producer, digging up dirt on the other contestants, making \"real\" TV. A part of her was seriously bothered by the fact that Brandon didn't know how he did his trick. It made her think illogical things. Alyson excelled in her science class and was always a firm believer that magic was fake. All a trick of the hands. She believed that all magic tricks had a logical way of being done…except Brandon's trick. And though she knew it was stupid, Alyson felt there was something going on in this house, something magical. -- The next morning, Alyson had trouble getting up. Her head felt heavy and her eyes struggled to open. She made a mental note- no more running around in the middle of the night trying to find answers. All she found were more questions…and that it was hard to get up the next morning. Managing to get to her feet, Alyson hurried through a shower and got ready. Checking her watch, she noticed that she missed breakfast, but still had enough time to get to the second challenge before it started. When she entered, all eyes were on her. Even Max had beat her. Glancing at Hunter and Brandon, she noticed they looked very awake. Stupid boys and their stupid lack of need for make up or hair styling. Taking her seat next to Danny, she beamed him a smile. \"Good morning.\" He grunted at her, focusing on Max, who looked ready to begin the second challenge. Alyson shrugged, happy that he chose to acknowledge her this morning. \"Good morning everyone. I'm trusting that you had a good nights rest.\" Max looked at Alyson with that last statement and she gave him a thin smile. She didn't really realized the lack of sleep showed that much on her. Guess she was wrong. \"Now let's start the second challenge. Each of you have a wand. Etched on that wand is the name of a famous magician. You will be expected to master that magician's unique trick. You may use any prop, book, or room in this mansion to practice. I'll see you in two hours. Good luck.\" Brandon pulled out a wand from his pocket. \"Harry Blackstone, nice!\" Zoe magically found her wand as well, finding out that her magician was \"Alexander Herman.\" Riddled with anticipation, Alyson had a very strong feeling that she knew who Danny would get. \"Well?\" \"Well I haven't- oh. Harry Houdini,\" answered a shocked Danny when the wand simply \"popped\" out of no where. Alyson mentally pumped her fist in the air. She knew it! Grinning at the other contestants, Alyson turned back to Danny. \"So where should we sta-…\" But where Danny was previously sitting was empty. Turning to Cedric, she shook his shoulder a couple times. He was passed out next to her, obviously tired from their exploration the night before. \"Wah? … I'm up!\" exclaimed Cedric. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. \"Where's Danny?\" \"That's what I would like to know!\" cried out Alyson, frustrated with the boy that had once occupied the seat next to her and his obvious lack of social skills. By this time, Brandon and Zoe were off, studying their own tricks. Alyson walked around the foyer, where Brandon happened to be practicing, yet another card trick. \"Has anyone seen Danny?\" asked Alyson, throwing her hands up in defeat. \"Can't say I've been…looking,\" replied Brandon, doing a sweep of his hand to present Alyson with a bouquet of flowers. \"But why not spend the time with me, instead of looking for him?\" Brandon gave her a grin. Giving him a look of disgust, Alyson opened her mouth, but was cut off my Zoe. \"Easy cheesy,\" she warned Brandon. Turning to Alyson, she suggested, \"Why not look in the study?\" Sighing, Alyson gave Zoe a look of thanks. \"M'kay. Cedric, you get some shots of around here, get some of Zoe and Brandon practicing. I'm going to find Danny,\" order Alyson, clearly tested. Leaving the group behind, Alyson opened the big oak doors, the HEAVY oak doors, that led to the library. Having always been outcasted, libraries were Alyson's greatest ally. The books never rejected any person willing to read them, and the quiet walls prevented any mean words to reach her ears. Back in school, Alyson would often just ditch lunch and go to the library and read, or do homework, or just…think. This one was filled high with books and had a dome cap ceiling with a design so beautiful, Alyson bet she could stare at it for hours, just tracing the design with her eyes. The sun was the main source of lighting for the room, the rays reaching out to cover every inch that it could. Surprisingly, there was only one table in the vast room. Unsurprisingly, it was occupied. Danny hadn't noticed Alyson when she entered, even though he was facing the doors. Alyson knew that he must have been so entranced by his book that he didn't notice… or maybe he was just that good at ignoring her. Tempted to pull out her handheld camera and start filming without Cedric, Alyson decided she did not want to be ignored anymore. Leaning over his shoulder, Alyson asked, \"Well I don't see any Houdini books lying around in this mess.\" She was leaning so close to Danny that she could smell his scent and practically feel the heat radiating off of him. When he didn't jump or act surprise by her being there, Alyson realized that he must have noticed her entrance. He turned his head to the side slightly, to look at her, calling her bluff. \"Don't worry,\" he sneered. \"I have that covered.\" Their faces were so close, that if Alyson were to turn her head just the teeniest bit towards him, they would be touching. She couldn't help but have a teasing smile on her face as well. She leaned in closer, so that she could reach around and grab the book that was right in front of Danny. \"So what's all this about?\" While she was still in the process of leaning over Danny's shoulder, Cedric came in. \"Hey Alyson, I've finished…oh, I'm interrupting. Sorry.\" Cedric turned to exit, but stopped after Alyson called out to him. \"Cedric wait! I was just asking Danny if I could help him… research,\" cleared up Alyson. Plopping into the seat next to his, Alyson snuck a glance at Danny, who just smirked at her. He raised an eyebrow in an \"I win\" kinda way. Alyson chose to ignore it. Timidly, Cedric came closer. \"Should I film this?\" \"Um, I don't know if that would be interesting. Maybe more action shots of the other magicians?\" suggested Alyson, wanting to get Danny alone. \"You're the boss,\" nodded Cedric, exiting the study. \"'You're the boss,'\" mocked Danny sarcastically. \"Ow!\" he yelped as Alyson whacked him in the back of the head with a thick book. \"So what's with these non-Houdini books?\" inquired Alyson. Still rubbing his head, Danny answered, \"Uh, it's kinda a long story.\" Settling into her seat, Alyson countered, \"I've got time.\" Sighing, Danny turned towards her. \"Fine, since you are supposedly the Puzzle Master, maybe you can help.\" He had Alyson's full attention. \"I'd love to!\" she offered. \"See, every book or website I've ever read about the Magic Mansion has talked about hidden rooms and secret chambers. And even Max mentioned the mystery that this place holds,\" explained Danny. Nodding Alyson absorbed this all in. \"Ok, more information please.\" \"Well, I've been searching through these books that are suppose to tell about the mansion's history but they are no more revealing then anything I could have gotten out of a public library. Where's all the secret stuff? It's gotta be around here some place.\" Danny closed the book he was reading and ran this hands through his hair, visibly giving up. All the while Danny was talking, Alyson was examining the books on the table. Inspiration struck her. \"Hold on.\" She frantically searched through the pile on the desk, until she found what she was looking for. \"Wha…what are you doing?\" asked Danny, as her rummaging disturbed his giving up. \"Just give me a minute,\" shushed Alyson, grabbing a book and nearly running off to the shelves. She was stopped by Danny grabbing her wrist. \"Would you please tell me what you are doing?\" he pleaded. \"Look at the spine.\" Alyson pointed to a symbol of a sun with a book in the middle. \"See how some of the books have markings on their bindings and some don't?\" Danny's look showed that he noticed, but didn't see how that connected. \"We need to find all the books with the symbol!\" Alyson watched as something clicked with Danny and bolted from his seat to the shelves. She took it as her turn to go book hunting, too. Finally, a stack of about 30 books were stacked on the table. \"Ok,\" stated Danny, hands on his hips. \"What now?\" \"See the marks on these bindings? I'm betting that these are your puzzle pieces pal,\" said Alyson excitedly. \"Now it's up to us to solve it.\" Danny was caught up in the excitement, too, for he picked Alyson up and spun her around once, then placed her back on the ground. \"Alyson, you are brilliant!\" Tucking a piece of hair behind her ear, Alyson smiled. \"Thank you for noticing.\" \"Don't mention it. Now let's get to work.\" Trial and error was what got them to the final clue. The books' markings had formed the picture of two snakes, facing each other when properly stacked. \"Wow,\" said Danny. \"Serpents! … two serpents…\" Turning to Danny, Alyson asked, \"Do you recognize it?\" \"I've seen it…\" He turned back to Alyson. \"I can't believe you figured this out!\" Blushing, Alyson shrugged. \"Com- come on now. Anyone could have figured it out.\" \"Not me,\" praised Danny, causing Alyson to blush harder. She tried to hide it. Luckily, Danny found what he was looking for. Pulling out a map from an older book, Danny searched until he found the symbol. \"Here! There it is.\" He pointed at the serpents on his map. \"What does that mean?\" asked Alyson. \"It means, if we want to find where this is leading us… we have to find the symbol!\" Danny nearly shouted the last part. Alyson couldn't help but grin. She liked seeing Danny excited. She was glad that the boy COULD get excited. \"We find the symbol, we find the secret room,\" stated Danny, turning towards here, a big smile on his face. Alyson was completely lost with the whole \"secret room\" thing, but she was always up for some adventure. She nodded at him. \"Follow me,\" ordered Danny. -- Half pulling, half dragging, Danny and Alyson managed to get Cedric to follow them into the basement. As the stairs grew in number and the amount of light lessened, their patience with Cedric dwindled. \"Uh, guys? I don't think this is such a great idea…\" he complained. \"Would you rather stay here by yourself?\" questioned Alyson sharply. \"No…\" confirmed Cedric. Danny led them down to a dead end. He searched the area, but when he met Alyson's questioning look, he stated, \"It's suppose to be around here, it must be the other way.\" He retraced his steps until they led him to a woodened wall. Finding an odd shaped groove, Danny tugged it to the side and the wall slid to let them pass. They were in pitch darkness now, with their only light coming from Cedric's camera. The floor was grimy and the air smelled musty to Alyson as she loyally followed Danny, deeper and deeper. \"Guys,\" whined Cedric. \"Let's go back. We shouldn't be here.\" Danny ignored him and opened another door, leading to more darkness. Stepping inside, the sound of beating wings and a screech made Alyson close her eyes and start running blindly in any direction. She hit something solid with a thud and realized by the smell that it was Danny. Cowering into his chest, Alyson felt his arms wrap around her protectively and she held her breath. When the noise died down to just their breathing, Danny asked timidly, \"Alyson, are you ok?\" Slowly, Alyson opened her eyes. Feeling her face, then forehead, then hair and reassuring that nothing was wrong, she nodded. \"Ok, good,\" said Danny, sounding relieved. He took her hand and led her forward. \"Now come on. I'll have my cell phone light the way.\" Following obediently, Alyson noticed how much darker it was. They no longer had Cedric and his camera. When the bat \"attacked,\" it appeared that the coward had bolted and left them alone. In the dark. With the killer bats. Danny, determined as ever, held his cell phone open, using it to light the way through the darkness. Alyson held on to his hand even tighter. The atmosphere was getting to her. Stupid Cedric making her paranoid. \"Look! It's the symbol!\" cried out Danny, picking up the pace to the symbol. He's steps slowed though. \"Crap.\" Danny's symbol was carved into the stone wall. It appeared that they were at a dead end. \"No wait, what's this?\" asked Alyson, pointing to letters under the carving. \"Bri legat arcane intra reperiel.\" \"What does that mean?\" asked Danny, running his hands through his hair. \"It means, 'Whoever reads books, finds secrets within,'\" translated Alyson. She knew taking those three years of Latin was not in vain. Danny threw his hands up in the air. \"Great! Now we need a book!\" He sank to the ground, shutting his phone in the process. Alyson was in pitch darkness. She knew where he was a few seconds ago, but her blind swipe in that direction met nothing but air. \"Danny? Dan-\" Alyson managed to trip over something. That something was Danny's legs. The sprawl led her some few feet away from where she fell from. \"Danny? Danny, help me find you.\" Crawling on her hands and knees, Alyson could not help but be disgusted. \"How on earth are you sitting on this dirty floor? I'm disgusted crawling on it!\" \"Well then stand up,\" suggested Danny offhandedly, still thinking about the clue and how they were led down this far for nothing. \"What if the bats come back?\" whimpered Alyson. \"Just stick out your hand in my direction.\" THU-whack! Alyson had to stop moving forward. \"You just hit my boob.\" \"Uh, sorry,\" apologized Danny. \"Just grab my hand.\" \"That really hurt,\" stated Alyson, still not moving. Sighing, Danny gave an eye roll that Alyson could not see due to the darkness and grabbed at where he suspected her arm was. He successfully grabbed it and pulled her into his lap. \"Shad up you big baby.\" Alyson was still before she relaxed into him, giving a giggle. \"We are stupid. You could have just opened your phone again.\" Danny let out a chuckle. \"We used all our smarts figuring out how to get here. And now that we are here, we can't figure out this clue.\" His tone turned bitter. \"C'mon,\" said Alyson getting up and offering Danny her hand. \"It has to be misdirection.\" Grabbing his phone and pointing its light at the craving, Alyson noticed that between the snakes was now a book. She grinned. \"Look! It's a book! And how do you read a book?\" She watched it register on his face. \"You hafta turn the pages!\" they cried out together. Grabbing the book, Danny was able to turn it like a knob almost, which allowed them to enter another room. The next room was shiny. That's how Alyson would have described it. It was a vault, with a big lock, that you had to turn to open. As soon as Danny touched the lock, the door that they entered through had shut. It was a stone door to begin with, and just managed to slide when they turned the book in the carving. Alyson whispered Danny's name, and nodded towards the closed door, indicating that they were trapped. Grabbing the lock, Danny spun it one way, then the next. One last spin and the vault door opened with a click. Releasing the breath that she didn't even notice she was holding, Alyson breathed out, \"How did you do that?\" Pushing the vault door farther open, Danny replied casually, \"Lots of practice.\" Alyson was going to ask about how that came along, but instead she followed Danny through the tiny tunnel that the vault was hiding and into a brightly lit room, thanks to all the candles and torches that were scattered around the room. The tunnel was a little crawl space, awkward to get into, awkward to get out of. Luckily, Danny was there to give Alyson his hand so she could land somewhat gracefully onto the ground. \"Wow.\" \"I know,\" grinned Danny. \"I just can't believe it! We found de Milo's secret library!\" They looked on the desk at all the books littered around. Danny was having a field day opening books, reading a few lines then moving on to another book. \"Well, now that we are here, what are we looking for?\" asked Alyson. Noticing another knob, looking just like the one on the stone craving Alyson exclaimed, \"Oh looky!\" She twisted the knob just as she heard Danny warn, \"Alyson, no!\" The world turned black and the next moment, Alyson found herself falling. \"Ouf!\" she cried as she landed on top of Danny on the floor of the library. She gave him a weak smile. \"My bad?\" His glare made her smile falter and she gave an eye roll before sighing and rolling off of him. \"Can you explain to me what just happened?\" \"I don't know,\" answered Danny. \"But things just keep getting stranger by the second.\" \"Thank you Captain Obvious,\" stated Alyson as she got up and dusted herself off. Though the whole being-in-one-place-and-then-getting-transported-to-another thing was kinda cool, it also left her baffled. \"Let's get outta here,\" suggested Danny, wiping his jeans off. \"I hope you are ready for your next challenge,\" said Alyson, wanting to get away from the eeriness of the library. It was no longer comforting. -- Alyson and Danny managed to get back just in time for the challenge to officially start. Being slightly late meant that they had missed Max's spiel about the prizes and the contestants. Alyson was thankful. First up was Zoe again. She skipped on stage, perky girl that she was, and preformed the classic trick of the rabbits in the hat. Zoe managed to pull out three rabbits from the hat, the last one being extremely fat and appeared to get stuck. Alyson couldn't help but laugh. Max awarded her a six. Next was Brandon and his levitating light bulb trick. He made it float through the air, around a hoop, and even threw it out into the crowd, teasing Danny with it. He would hold it at arms length, then as Danny would reach for it, Brandon would raise it higher. Danny laughed good naturedly. When Brandon's act was over, he made the light bulb extinguish and was given an eight. Though confused at why Danny was letting himself be teased like that, Alyson soon found out why. Danny walked out on stage with Brandon and Hunter in an elephant costume, trailing behind him. \"Though known for his famous escapes, I will attempt to reenact Houdini's trick of making a 10 ton elephant disappear. Right off this stage,\" Danny beamed at the crowd. Whispering in Danny's ear, Brandon muttered, \"I maybe dressed as an elephant, but I sure feel like a horse's butt right now.\" \"Get over it,\" ordered Danny, shoving a peanut in Brandon's mouth. Brandon scowled a spat the peanut back at Danny, who drew the curtain closed. \"Now, ladies and gentlemen, may I present you with Houdini's-\"A shrill shrieking was heard from behind the curtain and it was moving feverishly. \"Houdini's vanishing elephant trick!\" The curtain fell with Danny's last words to show a shocked Hunter, the end half of the elephant, on the ground, looking up in fear at Brandon, who was crying on a bucking mechanical bull, hanging on desperately. Max got up from his seat, shocked. Alyson and Danny exchanged a look, Danny's eyes full of fear. Brandon managed to get thrown from the bull onto the stage, and was helped up by Hunter, who gave Danny a look that could kill. So Danny did what was becoming a habit for him. He bolted. Author's Note- Ok, I really wanted to finish this. It was driving me nuts because I wanted to get to a certain part, which I got to, but it didn't come out as nice as I wanted it. Granted, it's 2 in the morning, and I'm tired but can't sleep, so I'm gonna hold off posting this til after I get some sleep or some coffee. We'll see. And I just thought of a cute scene for the next chapter. So hopefully I'll post it soon. I hope this is soon enough for you laziliterose. Lol. So much for a week. .o[Chapter 5] Author's Note- I'm so sorry about the wait, but life has been a bitch to me lately. I've had the ACTs ((and probably failed them. Unless the last nine answers to the math part is \"D\" I'm really just screwed.)), then my neighbor died and our families were close. Then I had the AP exams in both history and English to study for. And then, my one good friend just died in a car accident. It was horrible. But while I was moping, I read a lot of X-men fanfics, and I got inspired again. Sorry for the wait, but I'm back! And only like...4-ish more chapters :) LazuliteRose- Your threatening reviews make me feel loved. Had you not be so consistent with the story, I don't think I would have kept writing. So thank you. Hopefully I don't disappoint And I know that I promised you. I sawry. Disney Queen - It's nice to know that you are reading. Your review made me smile :D Disclaimer: Disclaimers are disheartening to write. It reminds me how broke I am and how I don't own anything. Alyson huffed in annoyance. This stupid boy and his running. Sprinting after him, Alyson hurried after Danny. \"Danny! Danny, stop!\" He just kept ignoring her and led her farther and farther from the others. \"Daniel!\" Danny turned around and shot his arms out to slam against the wall on either side of Alyson. She pressed herself against the wall, trapped between Danny's arms. The look in his eyes was feral, and she could have sworn that he would snarl at her. Determined to not show her fear, Alyson straightened up and looked Danny in the eye. \"Why do you keep running?\" His eyes flashed. \"Why do you keep following me!?\" Clenching her fists, Alyson shouted back, tears threatening to fall from her eyes, \"Because that's what you do with people that you care about… you make sure that they don't do something to hurt themselves when something bad happens!\" Fire dying out, Danny sighed. He rested his forehead against Alyson's. \"Look, Alyson. I'm a freak. Dangerous even. I should have never came. I'll just end up harming you. It's best that you stay away. Let me just go into my room, I'll pack up, and leave. I'm sorry I couldn't win it for you.\" Danny pulled away, letting his arms drop. Shock came across Alyson's face. \"…No. You can't. Danny!\" He turned around, probably intending to warn Alyson again, but was thrown off when Alyson launched herself at him, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head on Danny's chest. \"Don't leave me,\" she pleaded into his chest, holding him tight. She felt him sigh, then promise, \"I won't leave you…\" When the two entered into Mrs. McAlister's \"office,\" they entered a mad house. Everyone was in a craze, shouting things while things were being shouted back at them. Noticing that Danny and Alyson were finally there, Mrs. McAlister motioned for Danny to sit while she regained order. \"Ok, ok! One at a time!\" she ordered. Hunter made his statement first. \"He\" Hunter thrusted a threatening finger at Danny,\" needs to be taken off the show!\" Immediately, Alyson jumped to Danny's defense. \"You are just jealous! Your magician just levitated a 60 watt light bulb, I mean, MY guy just made a mechanical bull appear.\" Sighing as if Alyson were a little kid that he had to explain himself to, Hunter stated, \"That's exactly my point. There is no possible way he could do that!\" Rolling her eyes at Hunter she retorted, \"But he did.\" \"Ok, how?\" asked Hunter, attention moving from Alyson to Danny, who was sitting at a desk, looking nervous. \"Tell me how you did your trick.\" \"A good magician never reveals his secrets,\" recited Alyson to Hunter. She gave a nod to Danny, who just shrugged, giving her a small smile. Smirking, Hunter realized, \"Or maybe it's because he can't. Because it wasn't a trick.\" Entering the conversation, Mrs. McAlister interjected, \"Then what are you suggesting?\" Straightening up, Hunter answered, a bit uncertain, \"I, uh, think he might be a, erm, maybe, it was real.\" The eye rolls and soft laughing were abundant in the room once his words were spoken. Alyson looked at Hunter, questioning the mental state of her normally logical rival, while Danny just stared at his hands. Mrs. McAlister looked doubtful. \"Real?\" \"Um, yeah. I think he might...I mean, what if he actually had magical powers?\" Hunter faded out a bit at the end, realizing how he sounded. \"Oh, yeah,\" stated Alyson sarcastically. \"Do you have any idea how crazy you sound?\" It was obvious that Hunter did know, and yet, it was obvious that he believed. \"Look, it's just possible, you know? Think about it. There is a lot of bizarre things we can't explain. Like...like ESP and mind readers...and...\" \"And Donald Trump's hair,\" threw in Cedric. \"Yeah, and people who make mechanical bulls appear out of thin air,\" finished Alyson, sarcasm heavy in her voice. Hunter gave a humorless laugh. \"While we are at it, I think it was Danny here that made Brandon disappear in the first challenge.\" Alyson sighed and turned to Danny. \"Look, as much as I believe that it's a total violation of the magician's code, why don't you just tell Hunter your trick so we can just\" Alyson threw her hands in the air \"move on.\" \"You heard her, man, give it up,\" ordered Hunter. \"Yeah dude, tell us how you did it, we really wanna know,\" whined Brandon. \"Ok fine!\" snapped Danny. \"You want to know how I did it? Hunter is right. I don't know how I did it. I don't understand anything about it. These things just happen to me!\" Glaring at Hunter, he added, \"There, are you happy?\" \"Very good Danny, that's the ideal answer,\" drawled Max from the doorway. \"You're really learning how to play this game.\" Looking confused, Hunter asked, \"What? What are you talking about?\" Smirking, Max answered, \"Danny just used one of the many tricks we magicians have in our black bag.\" \"I have no idea what you are talking about,\" stated Danny, turning to face Max. \"Do you know how many endless illusionists dodge publicity by claiming to have paranormal powers?\" asked Max. \"But I'm serious! I have no idea how the mechanical bull got there! Brandon just said that he 'felt like a horse's rear end' and it appeared!\" cried out Danny. \"Well, that's very interesting,\" stated Max, clearly not believing him. \"So I'll suppose that you wouldn't mind me getting together a group of experts and testing your claim, now would you?\" \"What sort of experts?\" asked Mrs. McAlister. \"Well, as president as the World Wide Skeptics I would suggest that you start with me,\" replied Max. \"World Wide skeptics? You?\" Danny looked in shock. \"Surprised? Don't be. No one knows better then a professional magician what nonsense real powers are. In fact there is a long and lustrous history of true magicians debunking paranormal pretenders because what we do is perform practiced entertainment and every fraud that comes along only serves to devalue our skills. So what do you say, young man? Will you agree to settle this nonsense once and for all?\" Alyson couldn't find Danny after the incident in the office. She didn't even know if he agreed to the testing. As soon as Max asked, Danny excused himself from the room. After exchanging some heated words with Hunter, Alyson went out in search for Danny. First stop was his room. Knocking on the door, Alyson called out, \"Danny? Danny, it's me. Open up!\" When no one answered, Alyson went off to the library, where from a window she watched Max's experts arrive. But still no Danny. Heading off to the secret room, Alyson held her breath. This was the only spot left for Danny to have gone. If he wasn't there, then that meant that he had left her...and that he lied. Exhaling the breath she was holding, Alyson didn't realize how high her hopes got as she twisted the lock on the giant value. Once she saw the familiar head of brown hair bent over a book in the secret room, Alyson entered. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked. \"The panel's waiting.\" Danny was reading a book, and shrugged at this statement. \"Hello?\" Alyson was tempted to wave her hand in front of his face, but then he moved. Danny tore his eyes away from his book to look at Alyson's. \"Alyson, I can't do this.\" \"What? Why not?\" \"Because whatever way it ends up, it's just gonna be a huge disaster for me.\" Alyson's brow crinkled in confusion. \"Why? So far you've played it perfectly. Seriously, do you even know what great TV you've been creating?\" When Danny's gaze left hers and went back to the book, it dawned on Alyson. \"Wait, you don't seriously believe that you have real powers, do you?\" Taking a deep breath, Danny tried to explain. \"Look. I'm going to try to explain something to you, but you have to promise me you'll just sit there and quietly and just let me get through it.\" Sinking into the seat next to Danny, Alyson replied, \"I'll be as silent as a monk. So what's the deal?\" \"C'mon. You're a smart girl. Think logically. How did those doves appear in your van? How did Brandon disappear from a stage with no trap door and how is no one missing a mechanical bull that just suddenly appears on stage? I mean, do you honestly believe it's because I'm such a good magician?\" Danny was barely keeping in his anger. \"What are you saying?\" asked Alyson, trying to follow along. \"I've said this before...I'm a freak,\" stated Danny, voice slightly cracking. \"I'm a freak.\" Alyson was trying so hard to believe him, since he believed that he was right. But she was a science girl, and what he was saying was not logical. \"Your powers...\" \"Look. About three years ago, I was walking home from school and I saw this really cool skateboard. I remembered thinking how much I wanted it, and then, it just appeared underneath me, and I was riding it.\" \"It just appeared?\" interjected Alyson. \"No, I made it appear,\" cleared up Danny. \"And then this one time, a bully was making fun of my hair or my pants or something, and I just wanted him to get lost. And then he was gone! They found him like ten feet up in an oak tree, hanging by his belt loop.\" \"How is that even possible?\" \"That's it! I don't know! Ever since that first incident, I have been driving myself crazy trying to figure out what's wrong with me. I can't control my magic, Alyson. I don't know how, or when things are going to happen, they just do!\" Danny threw his hands up in defeat. \"It...it must be so scary for you,\" realized Alyson, finally believing Danny. Danny gave a humorless laugh. \"It is. It's um...it's terrifying,\" he admitted to her. \"That's why I don't have any friends. And that's why I can't get up there in front of those experts. Either nothing will happen and I look like a totally fraud or my powers will go outta control and they recognize this 'great gift of mine' and I'll live on some government operating table being poked and probed like an alien lab rat!\" Sighing deeply, Alyson sympathized. \"Look. I can't even come close to saying I'm processing all this, but I certainly do know what it's like to be the outcast. The weirdo. The one that nobody else can ever relate to. Not much fun, right?\" Danny shook his head in agreement. \"No, not so much.\" Breaking into a small smile, Alyson said, \"See? This is why this is so perfect. Maybe all you need through this is just one person. One person who is going to believe in you.\" Smiling back, Danny whispered, \"And that person is you.\" \"If you want me to be,\" answered Alyson. She gave a small shrug. \"Isn't that what friends are for?\" Danny smiled and mumbled, \"Yeah I guess.\" \"And you know what else? I think you should go face Max's experts. Maybe they can help you. Maybe they can explain all this.\" Alyson felt bold and reached for Danny's hand across the table. Slipping her hand into his, she briefly noted how they seem to fit perfectly together; like two puzzle pieces. \"What do you really have to lose, Danny? I mean, isn't this why you were so desperate to get here in the first place? To find the truth? These guys might finally give you the answers you need.\" Giving her that lop-sided grin that she loved so much, Danny pulled his hand out of Alyson's. \"Thanks Alyson. I think I'll do it. But...I think we can make them wait a bit more. I kind of want to collect my thoughts.\" \"Sure,\" said Alyson as she got up from her seat. She turned towards the exit, hesitated, and then made up her mind. Going over to where Danny was sitting, Alyson bent down and wrapped him in a big hug. Hugging her back, Danny drew her into his lap, and they held each other, both gaining strength from the other. Head tucked under Danny's chin, Alyson leaned into Danny's chest and just listened to his heart beat. If just being here for him was what Danny needed her to do, she could do that for him. They sat that way for how long, Alyson couldn't tell. But then she heard something. Danny was singing softly. Just another morning glory, one more twist inside of this wide ride. Another chapter in the story, but I can't hide, the way I feel inside. It was beautiful, Alyson decided. And the fact that he was sharing it with her made it even more special to her. Cause I'm a stranger in a strange land, and I'm a million miles from my home. And if I gotta take my last stand, I won't stand alone. I won't stand alone. I won't stand alone. I won't stand alone. I won't stand alone. When Alyson recognized the second part repeating, she joined in. Cause I'm a stranger in a strange land. ((Cause you're a stranger in a strange land.)) And I'm a million miles from my home. ((And you're a million miles from your home.)) If I have to take my last stand, ((If you have to take your last stand,)) I won't stand alone. ((You won't stand alone.)) I won't stand alone. ((You won't stand alone.)) I won't stand alone. ((You won't stand alone.)) I won't stand alone. ((You won't stand alone.)) The song finished, both of their voices in perfect harmony. Once it was over, they remained in their former positions, neither wanting to get up and face the real world at the moment. As Alyson closed her eyes and focused on Danny's heartbeat, his smell surrounding her, and the warmth from his body, she realized that that was the exact moment that she fell in love with him. Author's Note- I so wanted a make out scene. But I don't see that in either character. The hug scene in the way beginning was at first a kiss scene, but I changed it . Trying to slow the story down, in a way. Woot! So I updated! Viva la resistance! Hopefully my lack of updates didn't chase away my two favorite reviewers :) ","Summary":" Author's Note: Ok, so I totally watched \"Now You See It…\" on the Disney Channel a few days ago an"},{"Movie":"13th Warrior","Title":"Mist Runner","Author":"Bad Luck Bree","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3974053","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue The thirteenth warrior shall be no Northman. Thirteen warriors sailed to the land of Hrothgar. Fourteen arrived at the Mead Hall. And two were not Northmen. One was a Northwoman. Come and I shall tell you the untold tale of the last of Aslaug's children. The lost child, the lost and forgotten one. Much like you, young and restless in the world…and alone. Alone and forsaken. No one was told of the role played by this girl. Yes, when set alongside such warriors as Herger the Joyous, Edgtho the Silent and Buliwyf himself, she would diminish in her worth and renown. And you are right. None remember her…none know she was there. Perhaps she prefers it that way. Renown is not what she was seeking. She left that to those who thought fame was all that mattered. She sought revenge for what had been done, not only to her kin, but to her. Left to die, abandoned, orphan of the wilds…she found herself living alone, slipping slowly into the madness of despair and hopelessness. And that was how they found her, alone and stripped of everything; sanity, possessions, hope… This tale may seem fantastic to you. If you do not believe in the truth of this story, at least enjoy it as a fanciful yarn of what the old days used to be. So remember the fourteenth traveler. And remember the warrior known as the Mist Runner.[Chapter 2] Chapter I Unexpected Companion The sky was one unending sheet of gray, broken with a few tears of charcoal. Fog lay heavy over the water, coating everything in a dampness that seemed to seep through to the bones. Ahmed Ibn Fahalan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad sat miserably, trying not to show his discomfort. He was still unused to the cold, wet climate of these northern lands, but he dare not give the men he traveled with any more reasons to jeer at him, however 'innocent' their jibes were. Shifting the weight of the heavy broadsword slung across his back, he stood, squinting his eyes as he looked toward the others. \"Edgtho has been gone a while,\" came the voice of one. He recognized the voice of Ragnar, a grim-faced old warrior. \"Even he is unfamiliar with these lands,\" came the answer from the smallest of the group, a man known by the name of Herger. He left the others to join Ahmed, passing him a gleeful smile, \"Why the frown, little brother? Do you not find this land a pleasant one? Or have you tired of being wet?\" He laughed, thumping Ahmed heartily on the back, almost knocking him over. Ahmed righted himself, watching as the horses were unloaded from the ship, tossing their heads as they were brought onto dry land again. His own horse, a small, delicate creature from the Arabian breed, was brought out as well. Ahmed began to saddle his horse, but took this time to observe his surroundings. The land was harsh looking, cold and unforgiving as the sea they had just come from. A vast forest lay before them, dripping with the heavy dew, dark, wet trees looming up like great giants. Ahmed shuddered involuntarily, turning his attention to his horse. Halga, a massive bull of a man, strode past Ahmed, reaching out and ruffling the mane of the smaller Arabian horse. He laughed gruffly as the horse shied away slightly from the Norseman's hand. He spoke to Ahmed in a jovial tone, \"Your dog, he is uneasy!\" Ahmed looked down, avoiding any real eye contact, \"He is unused to a forest…\" As am I… Halga shook his head, but didn't reply, moving on with his own horse, a large draft animal. Ahmed looked away, back to the forbidding fringe of dark trees. He then saw Edgtho, the dark haired tracker, emerge from the tree line, beckoning to the leader of the group. Ahmed's eyes followed the broad shouldered form of Buliwyf, still mystified by the man. One look at him was enough to ensure that he was a warrior, but a cunning, intelligent man as well. A good candidate for chieftainship. Edgtho leaned down from his saddle, whispering something to Buliwyf. Buliwyf's strong face showed no reaction to the tracker's words. He simply turned, making a quick motion to his men, who had by now all saddled their horses, mounted and were ready to depart. Ahmed looked to Herger, who had taken his place beside him. Herger seemed willing to be Ahmed's 'mentor' in this land that was strange to him. He spoke in a low voice, \"What…what is it?\" Herger raised a hand, \"Shh…we'll find out soon enough.\" Buliwyf, now mounted on his own horse, sidestepped the animal toward the others, speaking slowly and calmly, \"Edgtho was followed on his way back. Arab…\" He didn't look at Ahmed as he addressed him, though Ahmed was turning his head toward the trees, \"…do not look. Whatever it is…it's still there.\" Ahmed quickly looked down, hearing Herger inquire, \"Is there only one?\" \"Edgtho says he only saw one.\" \"Do you think it will leave the trees?\" Edgtho joined them, answering Herger, \"I am not sure. But we need to get through the forest. We will have to be careful. Where is Rethel?\" \"Here, Edgtho,\" came the reply. An older man, gray haired and scarred, stepped forward, holding his longbow at the ready. This man fascinated Ahmed. He was perhaps the oldest of the group, but still a great warrior. While he wasn't as skilled in hand-to-hand combat, he was still able to fire his bow with deadly accuracy. And the bow he carried was no eastern short-curved bow. It was a solid thing, and Ahmed could only imagine how much strength it took to draw it back. The tracker nodded to the archer, \"I will go in front, you will follow in the rear.\" Rethel nodded, then strode away without a word. Ahmed heard Herger leaning over in his saddle. He turned to meet his face. Herger smiled at him, \"Nervous, little brother? You may have a chance to practice with your new blade!\" Ahmed winced slightly as the heavy sword shifted on his back, \"I am no Northman…how can I fight with a northern blade?\" Herger shrugged, \"Like any other blade. Form doesn't matter. How many enemies you kill does.\" Buliwyf had given the signal to move out, and Ahmed found himself near the rear, slightly in front of Rethel and next to Weath, a youthful red-haired warrior. Ahmed didn't speak. No one spoke or made a sound. And they didn't look at the canopy of trees, even though, by watching the shadows on the ground next to them, Ahmed could tell… They were being followed. They halted toward midday, forming a circle with their horses and making a meager meal of their rations. Ahmed's stomach had never settled well with the food these men ate. It was different from his normal diet, but he was slowly growing used to the heavy meat and coarse bread. He sat, holding the new blade before him. He didn't even dare to draw it, he was so afraid of it. He had never considered himself a warrior. Oh, he had some skill in swordsmanship, but that was with a curved blade. He was jerked from his reverie as a blood-curdling scream rent the damp air, followed by snarls and shouts. He leaped up, looking about wildly. Outside the ring of horses, he saw three of the men, Roneth, Halga and Ragnar, struggling wildly with something. Pushing his way through to them as the rest of the men made their way to see, he got a better look. Halga had his arm around the waist of a figure as Ragnar and Roneth kept tight hold of its arms and legs. It was growling madly, spitting and hissing like an animal. Ahmed saw Buliwyf looking coolly at the figure. It went still, glaring back at Buliwyf. Then Ahmed was able to get a better look at it. It was a wild looking person, a long mane of pale blonde, almost white hair streaked with slime falling in disarray over broadly built shoulders, two blazing eyes of a startling pale blue staring out at them. It was a strongly built creature, broad shoulders and supple, rigid muscles. It was dressed in what looked like animal pelts, a string of animal gut serving as a belt, and the pale skin was covered in old or new scars from exposure. But he had to look closer to realize that this creature was a girl, surely no older than nineteen or twenty years. Buliwyf examined the figure, which was still glaring balefully at him. He spoke slowly and calmly, \"Tell me, maiden…why were you following us?\" The girl bared her teeth, which, to Ahmed's horror, were strangely filed. She spat at Buliwyf's feet, snarling out something that resembled broken Norse, something so disjointed that Ahmed, still newly fluent in the language, had trouble understanding it. Halga, still holding onto the girl, squeezed slightly, causing her to choke. She wriggled, then growled out something else. This time Ahmed caught it. \"Helldogs! Let me go! I only wanted…horse!\" Buliwyf tilted his head slightly, watching the struggling girl, \"What are you called?\" She went still, narrowing her eyes. \"Skade…my name…Skade.\" Herger made a strange gesture. Ahmed whispered to him, \"What does that mean?\" \"Her name means death,\" Herger whispered back, making the gesture again. He looked back to the girl, \"She must be out of her head.\" Ahmed could believe that. The girl certainly looked insane. \"Why did you want the horse?\" asked Buliwyf, his face as emotionless as his voice. Skade hissed at him, lips drawn back again. \"Why are you here?\" \"We come on an errand to serve the lord of this land,\" Buliwyf answered, his hand resting lightly on his sword hilt. Skade spat out in bitter scorn, \"Pah! Hrothgar the fool, you mean? He's mad, you know!\" Buliwyf was not impressed with her, \"I advise you to speak better of your lord.\" \"Not my lord!\" Skade growled back, and Ahmed noticed that her words were fluent. Or perhaps he was simply learning more of the language. \"I follow my own law!\" Buliwyf looked the maid up and down. He could believe easily that she fended for herself. She looked as wild as any mountain deer and as fierce as any bear. But also, she looked as mad as she looked wild. \"Skade…it is not your real name, is it?\" The girl withdrew her tongue from her teeth, eyes narrowing, \"It is the name I gave myself! I have no other name.\" A few quizzical looks from the men. This girl was without a doubt mad. The long scar down the side of her face, which Ahmed just now noticed as the irregular color of the skin caught a shadow, gave testimony to some horrible accident. Perhaps something that had damaged her head deeply. He also saw many marks on her body that resembled clawmarks, as if an animal had attacked her and left scars where its claws had shorn through the skin. Her pale eyes caught his gaze. She narrowed the two orbs of blue fire, speaking in a voice filled with contemptuous unconcern, \"What do you stare at, dark one? Crawl back to Niflheim!\" Despite the poison on her tongue, this earned a few laughs from the men. Herger stifled a chuckle as he turned away from Ahmed, who was at a loss. \"Let her go, Halga,\" said Buliwyf, stifling some sort of facial expression, \"She poses no true threat. She's mad.\" Set free, Skade wriggled away, leaping with seemingly superhuman agility to the trunk of a nearby tree, looking very much like a tree-dwelling creature as she clung to an overhanging branch. \"What will you do, fools?\" \"We will do as we planned to do,\" answered Buliwyf, his eyes steady on the maiden's face, \"And you…will you continue to live like a beast?\" \"If you don't find it honorable, you will find that Hrothgar lives as a rat chased into a hole by a hound! You will all die! Die!\" She began to laugh madly, fanglike teeth bared. Ahmed looked aghast at her as the other men avoided her wild eyes. Was this girl like all the other women of this country? Wild, living like animals? He could almost believe it, but the other men seemed slightly surprised by her behavior, though it didn't upset them at all. Buliwyf didn't seem fazed, his eyes calm. He simply turned to his men, making a signal that they should follow him. To Ahmed's surprise, he made the same signal to the girl. She stopped her mad laughter, tilting her head, \"You wish me to follow you?\" \"I am not without pity,\" he said flatly, not even looking at her as he spoke. And with that, he spurred his horse on. The rest of the men followed, and Ahmed did the same, keeping one eye on Skade. She didn't move for a moment, then she dropped lightly down from the tree, walking behind the horses. She was able to keep up well, he noticed, even if the horses were only at a brisk trot. He now noticed the stains of blood blotching the garment of animal skins that she wore. If this is an omen, it can't be a good one…[Chapter 3] Chapter II Death's Wolves Ahmed was surprised at how well Skade had kept up with the pace the horses set. She seemed to jog or walk briskly beside them, level with their shoulders and effortlessly matching their strides. Her bare feet trod steady and sure on the treacherous ground, and Ahmed could see that she knew these woods better than anyone could ever hope to. But her presence was disconcerting. At least to him. Buliwyf didn't seem the least bit concerned. He seemed to forget she was there. Skade would alternate between whose horses she walked beside. She was most often in pace with Buliwyf's mount, as if attempting to prove something to him. Ahmed couldn't help but watch her in fascination. She would often look up, her wild face challenging as she stared at Buliwyf, who didn't even bother to return the glance. The forest thinned, changing to rolling hills. Ahmed saw in the distance…a settlement, assortments of thatched huts through which a muddied, well-trodden road ran. It was a dismal picture, the sky a bleak, sickly gray color to loom over this rude corner of humanity. Nothing like home Ahmed thought despondently to himself. Skade paused as she stepped out with the horses onto the open road. She seemed to hesitate, looking back at the forest. Ahmed could see in her face the desire to flee back into the wildness of the trees conflicting with a pride that would not allow her to show any change of mind. As if he had expected this, Buliwyf had paused, turning his head to look at Skade. The girl stared back at him, her strange pale eyes filled with defiance. She stepped forward resolutely, coming up even with the horse's shoulder. \"Welcome to the land of cowards.\" Her words were laden with poison as she spat them out bitterly. Buliwyf didn't seem moved. He simply nudged his horse forward. And Skade followed, still keeping pace. It was still a long ride to the Mead Hall of King Hrothgar, mounted on the highest point of the settlement. By the time they had reached the building, Skade's bare legs were covered in mud from the calve down. Many of the townsfolk had gazed at her in fear and wonder, though the sight of thirteen fearsome looking warriors, especially that of Buliwyf himself, had already captivated them. The men all dismounted their horses, going to the doors of the hall. Ahmed wondered if there was any sort of protocol in this culture that he must follow. But he saw the men simply walking into the hall, still fully armed. As he hesitated, he found that he had now fallen in beside Skade. He had to keep himself from wincing away from her. She was as tall, if not taller, as he himself was, and he could see the rigid muscles tensing beneath her pale, heavily scarred skin. Skade turned her strange eyes toward him, her expression wild and scornful, \"Frightened, Arab?\" \"No. But you are.\" She bared her teeth at him, starting rigidly into the hall. He followed after, feeling a smug satisfaction. \"You know he might be mad.\" Herger's statement seemed ridiculous now, though Ahmed himself had battled with the question after seeing the frail old man that acted as king. Skade stood amid the circle of men, suddenly forgetting her enmity towards them. She spoke in a voice void of any real emotion, \"Mad, yes…but what he says is true…\" Buliwyf was now taking special interest in Skade. He addressed her, \"You lived in the forests your whole life?\" Skade's eyes squinted for a moment, and uncertainty flashed in her face. Then she nodded, \"Yes…yes.\" \"Have you seen any of…them?\" Buliwyf's eyes were trained on her now, intense and concentrated. Skade paused before answering. She turned her face aside, the curtain of her hair shaking slightly. Ahmed's eye caught sight of four jagged scars crossing near her forehead, as if by the claws of some animal. \"This…\" Buliwyf pushed aside Skade's hair, indicating the scars. He turned to his men, \"You see this?\" He turned his attention back to Skade, \"What gave you this scar?\" \"One of them,\" Skade's voice was flat and harsh, her eyes set on Buliwyf. \"You see now why he is a fool? He cannot protect his own people…he does nothing but sit and wait for them to come!\" Ahmed saw some of the men looking at Skade with a type of awe and admiration. Skeld spoke in disbelief, \"How did you escape one?\" \"Was there more than one?\" \"Did you see it clearly?\" \"You were alone?\" \"Enough.\" Buliwyf held up his hand for silence. Skade's head had bowed slightly as if under the weight of the sudden attention. \"Do you know much about them?\" She raised her wild eyes, \"I…I don't remember…teeth and claws…but clubs and lances.\" She rubbed at a heavily scarred shoulder. \"I recognized this girl…\" The men all turned, seeing Hrothgar's wife, the elegant Weilew, striding towards them, her eyes set on the wild girl. She reached them, taking Skade's scarred face in her hands, and Ahmed half expected the wild girl to snap with her strangely filed teeth at the queen, but she seemed riveted by the noblewoman, \"Daughter of Aslaug…we thought everyone had been killed in that raid. It was at least ten years ago…\" She stroked Skade's head as one would a dog to console it, \"I'm sure of this…it is her…though she has suffered much, I would know one of Aslaug's brood. And look…\" Folding back Skade's animal hide tunic, Weilew revealed heavily muscled shoulders. Curving around the shoulder blades were two wolf tattoos, each stylized in the northern fashion. She nodded in satisfaction, \"Yes, I was sure of it. Only Aslaug and her husband would mark a girl with Fenris and Mangramyn.\" Turning Skade back to face her, she spoke slowly, as if to a child, \"Your name…it's Ötlu. Remember? Ötlu…\" Skade's eyelids flickered once, and then she seemed to hear. \"Ötlu…who is Ötlu?\" Ahmed looked to his companions. Now he knew this girl was mad. That scar must have been from a harsh blow to the head that caused her some mental damage. She couldn't remember whatever previous life she had once had. \"There was a raid on her village some years ago,\" Weilew explained, turning to the men, her hands still on the newly discovered Ötlu's shoulders, \"Everyone was found dead. The bodies were so mutilated that we could not tell who was who. I don't know how she escaped.\" She turned to Ötlu, speaking slowly again, \"Do you remember? The wendol…\" Many of the men shuddered as she spoke the dreaded name. \"How did you escape them?\" \"Wendol…wendol, wendol!\" Ötlu shrieked out the name, her face changing to one of hatred, \"Eaters of the dead! Spears and claws! So much blood…\" She seemed to cower now, her eyes rolling over white quite suddenly, \"A hole… mud…I hid in a hole, and one came after me…and I killed it!\" She began to laugh madly, \"Yes, I killed it! I broke its neck with my hands! It died in my arms!\" Her laugh sent a chill down Ahmed's spine, and he noted several of the men look with a mixture of fear and admiration toward the girl as she continued speaking, \"I skinned it…I took its hide, and I escaped from them! They didn't see me! But I killed it! Yes, I killed it!\" She seemed to dance in mad triumph, \"And I killed more! Over these years, I've seen them in the forest, and I killed them! I killed them with my hands!\" Then she paused in her laughter, \"But they don't stay dead…no, they come back…because of the heads!\" Buliwyf, his face unreadable, reached out and put a hand on the girl's shoulder, steadying her and forcing her to look at him, \"Then you can tell us about them? You can show us where they hide?\" Ötlu stared at him as if she had not heard or understood his question. Then she responded, \"They do not hide anywhere. They live with the mist. They are the mist, and the mist is them!\" \"But you can tell us about them?\" Buliwyf was now giving her his full attention, and Ahmed thought he could sense a slight softening towards her…or a creeping admiration. But it appalled him…a young female should not be hardened to such conflict! \"Yes, I can tell you all you want! I want them to all die! Because I remember! I remember the killing, oh yes, the killing…and the blood, and the screams, and the bodies! So many bodies!\" Her eyes rolled over into her head again, \"I tripped over one…and I didn't know who it was! You can never tell who they are after they are dead! But no heads, no heads at all…all gone!\" She began her mad laugh again. \"Take her inside,\" Buliwyf said to Weilew, shepherding Ötlu towards her. Ötlu didn't resist his help, and allowed Weilew to lead her inside. She was muttering under her breath, saying 'wendol' over and over again, coupled with some words Ahmed didn't know and assumed were curses. She and the queen soon disappeared inside the hall. Buliwyf's eyes had followed the girl's retreat to the hall. He turned back to his men, and Ahmed thought he saw the hint of a smile on the Norseman's hardened face, \"She's a credit to our kind.\" Ahmed would have argued. The girl was a maddened savage! But in this culture, it seemed that an ability to fight against any enemy was well respected, no matter what morals the individual possessed. He spoke now, voicing a concern, \"But should we trust her anymore than we can trust the old man? She seems just as mad.\" Herger shook his head, smiling grimly, \"I trust the marks on her skin more than the babbling of her tongue, don't you?\" Ahmed opened his mouth to reply, but closed it again. There was no understanding these people. ","Summary":" Prologue The thirteenth warrior shall be no Northman.

My friend had to watch this for her film studies class - of course I had to watch, too! xD Here's what came of it. Enjoy! ... Jenny paused before she got out of the cab. She looked out the window up at the big white house. It was a part of her childhood – familiar, more like a home than anywhere else she had stayed. The cabbie turned around, wondering why she was still in the car. She handed him the money with a murmered \"Thank you\" and declined his offer to help her with her bag. Singular, didn't even weigh much. She'd carried heavier burdens. She swung that bag over her right shoulder as she stepped out of the cab and shut the door. A distant rumble told her that Forrest was cutting the verdant grass that sprawled around his huge property. She headed towards the noise, passing through the space in the low stone wall, the swing hanging from the huge tree. Many golden after school hours had been spent pushing each other back and forth on that swing. Forrest had always pushed Jenny higher than she could ever push him, on account of his stronger arms. Jenny was never afraid. Forrests' hands were always gentle and warm on her back, always waiting to catch her if she fell or slow her down if she went too high. Forrest took care of her. Forrest saw Jenny, turned off the lawn mower without taking his eyes off her. Even now she knew he would take care of her. Forrest showed Jenny the unconditional care she had never known, without ever asking for anything in return. Jenny sometimes felt guilty in that she had nothing to give him back even if he did ask. But not now. Now, she was too tired of her life, too happy to see him that the guilt was pushed back for the moment. He ran to her as she kept steadily walking. They stopped a few feet from each other and paused. \"Hello, Forrest,\" Jenny said, her voice quiet and weary. She dropped her bag on the grass and flung her arms around him, burying her face in the collar of his shirt. The familiar comforting smell of Forrest filled her nose: laundry soap and clean air and fresh cut grass. After a moment she felt his arms circle her, too. She smiled a little and relaxed. She could rest at last. With Forrest, she felt safe. He was the one solid thing in her shifting world. No matter where she went, what she did, Forrest was always waiting for her to come back with the same unchanging compassion. Perhaps it was because of that feeling of security that she slept so well as he gently laid her on the bed. ... Thanks for reading, please review! =) ","Summary":" I do not own Forrest Gump.

Some I've like as not told you of, and some I'd just as soon never speak of, but there's so many things, I may never remember them all. But this ain't one of those. This is one I remember, largely in joy, but it wasn't all joyful. Lieutenant Dan led me and Bubba and all the rest on a raid, and it was a successful raid. One soldier, a United States Marine, was passing over Vietnam with his platoon going from somewhere else to back home. They was never supposed to be in-country. The plane put down when it took fire. This man was sent off to get help, but he was the one they needed to rescue. Turns out, we took him back just before he was to be sent up North, where the Lieutenant and Bubba said there was a hotel you never wanted to go to. Ever. Well, not only did we get our man, but the enemy commander who had captured him, and was trying his best to hurt him-just because he could, I guess. Lieutenant Dan said there was to be some justice, and it was not to be spoken of. He didn't sound too proud of this, and Bubba wondered if we wasn't going the same way the enemy had, when he had hurt our soldier. But he didn't say this too forcefully, like he felt he had to say it but wasn't sure he meaned it. The soldier's Gunnery Sergeant was there, set to have his man back, but he spoke a lot like Lieutenant Dan does about me. \"Lieutenant, for once he did all the right things, and we had to be in a place where that chucklehead still gets taken first thing. I don't know whether to hug the stupe or punch him in the nose!\" \"Gunnery Sergeant, I know the feeling. But don't be too hard on him. He survived out there longer than a man should before they got him, and he held out against their breaking like no man I've ever seen. A tribute to you, and that's no faint praise.\" \"Just make sure, sir, that I don't get to train anything on Victor Charles over there.\" \"That's being arranged for, Gunnery Sergeant. This is the field. We take care of things.\" The captured man came out of the tent we set him up in, looking bruised but alive and happy despite what he had seen, and he had seen a lot. He was a very friendly man, and when Bubba talked his ear off about shrimping, he listened, even if I could tell he didn't know from it, being from North Carolina, and not a coastal area neither. I asked him about North Carolina, and he said it was a fine state, and he asked me about Alabama, and I said it was a fine state, and we both agreed it was great that we both came from such fine states. We didn't need to talk much. It was like me and this man was made so much the same, it was all just understood. That's good, because I really never liked not understanding. Lieutenant Dan pointed his gun at the enemy commander, and he looked like he meant business. \"Private, do you have anything to say to this-man-before we deal with him?\" The man looked over the captured enemy commander, now all beaten down like he had been, and shook his head. \"Lieutenant, Sir? Gunnery Sergeant? I will say words to this man, but I first ask that in the name of all decency, we give him over to proper military authorities. This here ain't right, sirs. It ain't right at all.\" Both Lieutenant Dan and the Marine Sergeant were struck silent as though their mouths had been sewn shut by the man's request. The Lieutenant said later on he never heard all that many appeals to what was decent in that place, especially from a man who had been so wronged. The enemy commander, who spoke fair to middling English, gave the Marine Private a hateful glare. \"Why would you spare me? This is war! War requires monsters, and I feel my only crime is staying in one place too long trying to be a perfect enough monster to finally show you that a man can be broken! Will nothing ever wipe the eternal grin from your face?\" Now, it was the Gunnery Sergeant who smiled, and looked at the enemy commander, or I guess now he was just a POW. \"I can honestly say, from deep personal experience, pal : When it comes to wiping that grin off, you got nothing, because there is nothing that can do it! I was his DI, back in Basic. There is nothing. Period.\" \"But why would he spare me? In the name of a just war, I took him and had him destroyed over and over again. If I had a man as cruel as I had been to him in my grasp, the end would be swift!\" Lieutenant Dan would go on record as saying the Marine Private was the strangest man he ever met, even to myself, and he would never forget what he told his capturer. I'm not like to, either, and I think Bubba might've done the same, if he had stayed with us. \"Well, that would be your choice, sir, and I can say I don't much like it. But I can see when a man is not a monster, even when he says that's what he is. I saw that you cared for your men while we was out there, and held the rescue team off on your own when they came for me, so they could get away. It wasn't your job to care for me, sir. It was your job to care for your men, and I saw that you did just that. Like you say, this is a war, and I'm sad as all get-out to say it, but that makes us enemies. I can say you shouldn't do the things you did to anybody, but Privates Gump and Blue tell me war is just the ugliest thing ever, and a lot of small ugly things build inside of it. So for speaking to save your life here, sir, I ask only that you stop trying to be one of those small ugly things.\" I could tell that neither Lieutenant Dan nor the Gunnery Sergeant had their minds changed by these words, and as for me, I couldn't think of anything to say that the Marine Private hadn't done already. Like I said, we was something alike in a lot of ways. So it was Bubba found the words. \"Lieutenant Taylor? It was this man who suffered. He's asked us to spare our enemy, in the name of decency. How can we not respect his wishes?\" Bubba told me, just before the fight in which we lost him, that if he did not stop this execution, he would have had to answer to it before God, and his local preacher, who he feared even more than God. The Gunnery Sergeant didn't punch his rescued man, but he didn't hug him, neither. \"You never stop, do you? You just never stop being-You.\" \"Well, you have to admit, Gunnery Sergeant-stopping being me would be awfully hard, being as I am me. I think.\" They left to go back to the world. I heard that the Private tried to volunteer to stay in-country, feelin it was what he should do, but the Marine Corps felt like, if he were killed here after such a rescue before, it would make things look bad for them. In fact, someone said to me they made sure no one from that camp got the orders to come here, and just never spoke of why. Now one day much later on, when I was running through America, I passed through this man's little town in North Carolina, and as I drank a cold soda at his filling station, he asked me how I was, and I said I was fine, and I asked him how he was, and he said he was fine, and like I said, we just understood each other. He gave me the soda for free, which was nice. That's all I got to say about Private First Class Gomer Pyle, United States Marine Corps.

[Reto Soulmate de la página \"Retos Randoms de randoms fandoms\" de Facebook] Disclairmer: Forrest Gump no me pertenece ~ Capítulo único Por Amelia Badguy. 5000 palabras según Word. Las almas gemelas habían sido algo usual en la antigüedad, millones de libros escritos sobre parejas y sus almas gemelas, la búsqueda por encontrar el significado de tu marca, después de todo uno no obtenía ni el nombre ni las primeras palabras que su alma gemela le decía, sino que tenía una marca en su cuerpo, algo relacionado con la persona que estaba destinada para uno. Dan Taylor sabía esas cosas, por eso su marca siempre le daba curiosidad, aquella marca que estaba en su pantorrilla, esa que eran unos tenis deportivos, aquellos que usaban los deportistas para correr. Su madre le explicaba —después de todo su padre había muerto en la segunda guerra mundial, cuando él era pequeño— que tal vez la persona que estaba destinado para él le gustaba mucho correr o bien le gustaba el atletismo, lo cual para él tenía bastante sentido en realidad, pero él no deseaba un alma gemela. Él se uniría al ejercito, sería un hombre importante y moriría en el campo de batalla como su padre, siempre había pensado en aquello, no había tiempo para dejar a alguien sufriendo, como sufría su madre por la pérdida de su otra mitad. — La primera vez que había visto su marca le había parecido algo curioso a decir verdad. Era un casco, pero no un casco de fútbol o algo así, sino que era un casco militar, como había visto en algunas revistas y en la televisión. Le había preguntado a su madre, después de todo su mamá siempre sabía cómo explicarle las cosas, como hacerlas simples para él, por lo que ese día estaba sentado con ella en la sala, él con una mano en su muslo, sintiendo la tela de sus pantalones, aquellos que eran apretados por aquellos aparatos que usaba en sus piernas, siendo que debajo de aquella tela estaba aquel casco militar. — Mamá, ¿qué significa mi marca? — Su mamá le había explicado que algún día de su vida encontraría a una persona que lo iba a amar más que nada en su existencia, que iba a estar a su lado y lo iba a cuidar, sólo tenían que encontrarse por sus marcas, pues sus marcas significaban las cosas que a la otra persona le gustaban. — Bueno cariño, puede significar que tu alma gemela viene de una larga tradición militar — Le explicó, aunque la verdad ella había comenzado a pensar en lo que podía significar y sentía que su hijo no terminaría precisamente con una chica, lo cual la asustaba. En Alabama no eran gentiles ni con las personas de color ni con hombres que gustaban de otros hombres, aunque fuera algo destinado, no pensaba que la marca fuera a cambiar el pensamiento de las personas. Esperaba que su pequeña mentira fuera cierto, que la verdad fuera una linda chica con una familia con tradición militar, pero simplemente no estaba segura de que esperar ya. — Cuando fue creciendo fue conociendo a más gente, pero quién llamaba su atención siempre había sido Jenny, la muchacha con quién se había sentado en su primer día de escuela. Sabía que Jenny no ería su alma gemela, porque la verdad era que la chica no tenía ninguna marca. Él lo sabía pues una vez ella se lo había comentado con cierta tristeza, que no tenía una marca de alma gemela en su cuerpo, que nadie esperaría por ella, que nadie la amaría. Él le había dicho que no era así. No comprendía de muchas cosas en su vida, pero estaba seguro de que Jenny podría encontrar a alguien que la amara, como él la amaba, sólo bastaba que ella viera sus sentimientos, que la amaba a pesar de no ser muy listo, que siempre se preocuparía de ella, pero la joven parecía nunca ver más allá de lo que deseaba. Cuando había terminado la universidad se había inscrito en el ejercito. Más que nada lo había hecho porque pensó en su alma gemela, porque si bien amaba a la rubia, su mente le dijo que podría ser lindo encontrarse con la persona que estaba destinado para él, podrían tener una linda amistad o algo así, razón por la cual se había enlistado. Se había ido a despedir de Jenny, después de todo iría a Vietnam, pero se había sorprendido de encontrarla cantando, como ella siempre había deseado hacer, cantar en un escenario, claro que su mente no le dijo que eso era un club de strippers en realidad, sólo fue a rescatar a la rubia cuando un ebrio le había lanzado algo. — ¡Forrest entiende que no quiero que me ayudes! — Le gritó una vez que habían salido de aquel lugar de mala muerte en realidad, pues no era nada más que aquello donde ella trabaja. Estaba cansada de todo, de muchas cosas. Había tenido que crecer con su padre abusivo, que la violaba, que siempre le sacaba en cara que ella no tenía un alma gemela, que nunca tendría algo así y ella lo había creído de esa forma, nunca tendría un alma gemela y Forrest si la tenía. Cuando eran niños le había preguntado y él le había dado como respuesta un escuálido \"sí\", pero nunca se la había visto. Ella no podía estar a su lado, cuando alguien más esperaba por el hombre. — Jenny, venía a despedirme, me iré a Vietnam — Lo miró sorprendida cuando él le dijo aquellas palabras, él estaba decidido a marchar a aquella guerra, siendo que únicamente se acercó a él, luego de haber hecho parar a un auto para que la llevara lejos. — Promete que tendrás cuidado, Forrest, que cualquier cosa que ocurra, corres, sólo corres, ¿bueno? — Le murmuró mirando a quién había sido el único hombre que la había tratado bien en su vida, que no la había tratado como un pedazo de carne o algo así. — Lo prometo — Le dijo aquello último viendo como ella se subía a aquel auto y partía simplemente de su vida, como tenía por costumbre hacer. — Gritaba las ordenes, necesitaba malditos refuerzos en aquel momento, su pelotón estaba siendo completamente aniquilado, el muchacho que llevaba la radio estaba tirado muerto a su lado. Iba a morir, lo sabía bien, lo sabía perfectamente bien. Moriría sin conocer a su alma gemela, lo cual estaba bien dentro de todo, no le rompería el corazón a alguien al haberlo conocido, a alguien que se imaginara una vida con él, pero fue en ese momento cuando lo vio, cuando prácticamente cayó a su lado mientras él seguía gritando por refuerzos. — ¡Teniente Dan! ¡Coleman esta muerto! — Su voz lo hizo gruñir con fuerza, le hizo notar algo que sabía perfectamente. Todo su maldito pelotón debía estar igual de muerto que Coleman, pensó, menos ese idiota, que seguía siempre sus ordenes por más absurdas que fueran en realidad. — ¡Ya lo sé! ¡Mi pelotón entero esta aniquilado! — Gritó alejando el cuerpo de Forrest de él de él, gruñendo, necesitaba esos malditos refuerzos y le daba exactamente igual morir ahí, es decir, ya ni siquiera podía sentir bien sus piernas. Siguió gritando ordenes, escuchando que inundarían la zona con napalm, pero pudo sentir como ese soldado le quitaba su equipo y lo tomaba en brazos. No podía mover las malditas piernas, sino hubiera pataleado para que lo soltara, no podía salir de ahí, tenía que morir en el campo de batalla, ese era su destino y Forrest Gump se lo estaba arrebatando. Una bomba les explotó demasiado fuerte y cerca, había esperado que eso los matara ahí, que ese idiota no pudiera correr más, pero para su mala fortuna únicamente lo arrastró un poco más hasta que pudo volver a tomarlo en brazos y lo dejó cerca del río, junto con otros soldados, que seguramente había salvado de la misma manera que lo había salvado a él. — ¡¿Dónde crees que vas?! ¡Van a llenar la zona de napalm! — Le gritó demasiado frustrado, viendo a los soldados heridos a su lado, estaban asustados, aterrados por haber sentido a la muerte tan cerca de ellos. — ¡Debo rescatar a Bubba! — Gritó como si nada mientras volvía a correr a toda velocidad al interior de la jungla, haciendo que realmente se sorprendiera por todo lo que ese idiota podía correr. — Cuando despertó luego de la anestesia, supo que su vida estaba completamente arruinada. Le habían tenido que amputar ambas piernas por lo grave de la situación, ambas hasta un poco más abajo de las rodillas, lo que simplemente lo dejaba como un maldito un invalido, un fenómeno. Había perdido su marca de su alma gemela, pero la verdad eso no podía importarle menos en aquel momento, pues en todos esos días que llevaba en esa maldita camilla sin poder moverse con la libertad que antes tenía, con aquellos dolores fantasmas en sus piernas, había podido analizar de buena manera quién era su alma gemela, sobre todo luego de ver la marca en el muslo de Gump, que estaba en la camilla a su lado. Su maldita alma gemela era aquel idiota, que le había salvado la vida, que le había robado su destino, porque él iba a morir en aquel campo de batalla, tenía que morir ahí, era lo que tenía que hacer, lo que su destino familiar le había asignado. Los días eran horriblemente largos, donde tenía que soportar el parloteo de Gump algunas veces, hasta que el idiota comprendía que no quería escucharlo hablar y se iba por ahí a hacer alguna otra actividad o bien hasta que a él lo llevaban a tomar un baño —algo realmente humillante— o lo hacían salir a sentarse a la sala donde estaban todos los otros heridos, jugando alguna cosa o viendo televisión, intentando olvidar sus propios problemas. Lo ignoraba lo más que podía, porque simplemente no podía soportarlo, no podía soportar la idea de seguir vivo, cuando había deseado morir con honor en el campo de batalla y tampoco podía tolerar la idea de que ese idiota fuera su alma gemela, ¡es decir!, los dos eran hombres, el ejército no permitiría eso —aunque poco ya le importaba el ejército— siendo que tampoco la sociedad soportaría aquello. Las personas que tenían almas gemelas de su mismo sexo siempre lo ocultaban, ocultaban sus relaciones hasta que morían, porque simplemente no era tolerado, aunque ellos mismo no hubieran deseado nacer así, esa era la situación. Por las noches no podía dormir, eran horrible los dolores que sentía, siendo que al girar su vista pudo ver a Gump durmiendo placidamente en la cama con aquella estúpida paleta de ping pong en sus manos. No podía tolerar aquello más y como pudo se bajó de su cama aquella noche, para agarrar la camiseta de ese idiota y tirarlo al suelo con él. Le dijo todo lo que tenía que decir, como se sentía como un completo inútil, un fenómeno. Le había arrebatado su muerte y era su maldita alma gemela. Sin poder evitarlo apoyó la cabeza en el pecho de ese idiota y comenzó a llorar. La sensación que lo embargó fue de completa paz, algo que nunca había sentido antes. Nunca había sentido aquella calidez, como la sentía ahora apoyado en el pecho de Forrest, donde sentía que pertenecía, pero no, no podía, estaba demasiado herido como para aceptar ahora a su alma gemela, cuando siempre se había negado a buscarla. Se sentó cansado en el suelo, pasando una mano por su rostro completamente agotado, quería que todo aquello terminara de una maldita vez por todas, poder respirar tranquilo de una buena vez. — Habían pasado años desde que había sabido algo de Forrest. Cuando le habían dado el alta en el hospital, simplemente había tomado el primer maldito avión que encontró para volver a los Estados Unidos. Desde ese momento había comenzado a vivir con su pensión de jubilación, aquella que le daban por haber perdido sus dos piernas en Vietnam. Se había alejado de su familia y vivía sólo en ese cuarto de un maldito motel, pues no era nada más que eso, un motel barato, donde gastaba gran parte de su dinero en alcohol y acostándose con prostitutas que echaba cada vez que mencionaban algo de sus piernas. No había pensado en volver a ver a Gump nunca, claro estaba eso. Estaban terminando el año 1971, nada bueno vendría con el nuevo año, sólo la basura de siempre, la misma mierda en la que se venía ahogando desde que ese idiota lo había salvado en aquella jungla. Por eso había sido una maldita sorpresa cuando en su televisor, al escuchar los anuncios de un programa, oyó que su alma gemela estaría en un programa. El maldito había recibido la medalla de honor y había ido a China a jugar ping pong como si nada. No podía evitar estar molesto, realmente frustrado, siendo que sin pensarlo si quiera se había subido a su silla de ruedas y había ido a aquel estudio de televisión, ahí era el lugar donde encontraría a ese idiota, donde le gritaría por haberlo salvado. Odiaba su maldita vida, nada iba a cambiar eso, siendo que si podía desquitarse con Forrest estaba bien para él. — Encontrarse con el teniente Dan era algo que lo había alegrado demasiado, más pasar las fiestas de navidad junto a él. Podía ver como el hombre estaba realmente enfadado aún, por lo de sus piernas seguramente y lo comprendía. Él sabía perfectamente bien lo que era no poder utilizar sus piernas, pero a diferencia del teniente Dan él aún las poseía. El teniente estaba enojado con muchas personas, eso incluía a Dios en realidad, según lo que el hombre le había dicho, pero a pesar de todo aquello, esa noche en que estuvieron con esas dos mujeres el teniente lo defendió. Había apartado a esa chica de él, porque olía terriblemente a tabaco, cosa que le desagrado por completo y cuando esa mujer le había gritado idiota, su teniente lo había defendido. En ese instante había comprendido que el hombre odiaba que le dijeran invalido, tanto como él odiaba que le dijeran estúpido. — Gracias teniente Dan — Le murmuró con suavidad mientras veía como el hombre se sentaba en la cama. Se veía demasiado ebrio, más de lo que lo había visto los últimos días que había pasado ahí con él, siendo que únicamente se levantó del sofá donde había estado sentado para ayudarlo a recostarse bien en la cama. — No tienes que agradecer — Murmuró sin cuidado, mirando a ese idiota que le acomodaba las almohadas, siendo que pensó que dejaría al alcohol actuar y ya — ¿Sabes de las almas gemelas, Gump? — Sí, señor, mi marca es un casco de soldado — Le comentó como si fuera lo más obvio del mundo. — La mía son unos tenis, ¿sabes?... bueno la perdí cuando perdí mis piernas, estaba en mi pantorrilla — Le explicó, aunque no esperaba que Forrest razonara en aquel momento en realidad. Sabía que le costaba mucho más comprender las cosas a pesar de ser un graduado de una universidad y todo. — Es una pena que perdiera su marca, teniente Dan — Le comentó como si nada, cosa que le hizo reír, pero únicamente se movió en la cama, dejando un lado al hombre. — Es tarde para que vuelvas al hotel, Gump, duerme aquí... — Después de aquella noche, durmiendo ambos en la misma cama, Forrest se había tenido que marchar, siendo que pasaron dos años para que volviera a tener una noticia de él. No había querido mudarse de ahí, pues era la única dirección que aquel bobo tendría de él y no había errado. Le había enviado una carta diciendo que tenía un barco camaronero y él era un hombre de palabra. Fue con él, habían pasado casi dos años desde que había visto a Forrest. No podía negar que en realidad estaba emocionado por la situación, volver a estar con su alma gemela después de tanto tiempo. Aquella noche que habían compartido cama en el motel donde se hospedaba había sido reamente horrible, poder estar tan cerca de Gump y no poder tocarlo o hacer algo, siendo que había terminado por fingir que dormido se apoyaba en el cuerpo del hombre, para sentir esa tibieza, ese calor que lo hacía sentir que nada podría ir mal, aunque todo se estaba yendo a la misma mierda. Habían comenzado a trabajar juntos en aquel barco camaronero, siendo que no pescaban nada y la realidad era que no le sorprendía. Ellos tenían a penas un barco, los demás tenían al menos dos o tres, tenían años de experiencia en todo lo que pesca de camarones se refería realmente. Le había dicho, molesto, a Forrest que le rogara a su Dios por un milagro, que pescaran algo de una maldita vez por todas, y como siempre el hombre le había hecho caso de una manera que no esperaba para nada. Había ido a la iglesia a rezar por ellos, para que pudieran lograr su meta como pescadores de camarones. Por su parte había reducido su consumo de alcohol, pues si bien era cierto que seguía bebiendo, no lo hacía como antes, además de que pasaba la mayor parte del día en el maldito barco, colgado de las sogas de las velas y andando con sus manos por todos esos lados, por la madera astillada del piso. Sus manos no eran para nada suaves, estaban llenas de cayos y cortes que se hacía, quemaduras por las sogas, pero era su vida ahora y no podía hacer nada distinto para aquello. Lo que consideraba bueno, o bien podía considerar realmente su perdición, es que estaba siempre al lado de Forrest. Solían dormir en la misma hamaca en el barco, porque él le había dicho que así sería menos líos y si necesitaba ayuda para levantarse o algo sólo lo movería para despertarlo y que lo ayudara a salir de ahí, a lo que el Gump no se había negado en absoluto. Ese día lo estaba esperando fuera de la iglesia a la que iban, a penas terminaran saldrían al barco a pescar, pero no había podido seguir adentro simplemente. Veía a la gente salir y esperaba que Gump lo hiciera, aunque siempre tardaba un poco más debido a que pertenecía al coro del lugar. — — Hey Forrest — Se giró a ver a la persona que lo había llamado, encontrándose con el reverendo de la iglesia, que le dio unas suaves palmaditas en la espalda. — Hoy finalmente pude ver al teniente Dan que tanto hablas, ¿parece un poco amargado, no crees? No lo preguntaba de mala manera, aquel joven le preocupaba, después de todo había ido con una ilusión demasiado burda a esa lugar, hasta él siendo un hombre Dios sabía aquello, que ellos no estaban preparados para ser pescadores, pero esos dos hombres se veían convencidos. — Está enojado desde que perdió sus piernas, ahí tenía su marca de alma gemela, no creo que la persona que sea su alma gemela le vaya a creer — Le comentó encogiendo sus hombros, mirando al revendo que siempre se preocupaba de darle uno que otro consejo en el barco, como que sogas comprar cuando nadie más le decía. — Oh, eso es una pena, ¿qué marca tenía? — Le preguntó únicamente de curiosidad, ellos dos parecían conocerse tanto, aunque sólo habían sido soldado y teniente en la guerra, según lo que Forrest le había comentado cuando a veces se quedaba ayudando en el lugar. — El teniente Dan tenía unos tenis, su alma gemela debe ser alguien bueno para correr, ¿no cree? — Le dijo con su tono habitual, mirando al reverendo que lo observó un poco sorprendido. — ¿Qué marca tienes tú, Forrest? — Le pregunta brotó de sus labios con curiosidad, mirando al hombre. — Un casco militar — Nunca había tenido problemas para hablar de su marca en realidad, pero el hombre se quedo pensando por un momento y rápido llegó la idea a su mente, de que esos dos eran de verdad almas gemelas y él no era quién para cuestionarlos si Dios había puesto aquello en sus pieles. — ¿No crees que el teniente Dan es tu alma gemela? A ti te gusta correr, siempre corres a cualquier sitio y siempre estuviste en eso en la universidad... y me contaste que el teniente ha venido de una larga tradición militar, ¿no es cierto? — Suponía que el teniente ya sabía la situación, simplemente estaba esperando que Forrest lo descubriera por sí mismo o tal vez había algo más. El hombre pareció pensarlo un momento, pero el grito del teniente Dan fue lo suficientemente fuerte para que se apresurara, después de todo irían a pescar esa noche. — Quiso conversar con el teniente sobre lo que había hablado con el reverendo, pero la verdad el hombre parecía determinado a que ese día pescarían algo, siendo que cuando estaban ahí en alta mar se desató una gran tormenta. Ninguno de los dos había esperado aquello, él sólo manejaba la nave guiado por los gritos que le escuchaba al teniente Dan, que estaba en uno de los mástiles del barco, gritando como un loco, parecía que se estaba enfrentando a Dios, que le estaba diciendo todo lo que sentía en él, todo el enojo que tenía, lo mal que realmente lo había pasado durante todos esos años, cuando Forrest lo había sacado de la jungla. No supo como sobrevivieron a esa tormenta, pero lo hicieron, cuando volvieron al puerto pudieron ver que lo que había pasado era un huracán, que destruyó la mayoría de las casas y de los barcos, siendo que realmente el único barco que había salido ileso era el barco de ellos, como si la discusión con Dios que el teniente Dan había tenido hubiera servido para aquello. — Ahora pescaremos un montón de camarones — Le dijo con una sonrisa. Se había vuelto demasiado loco a decir verdad, lo sabía perfectamente, pero rayos, de verdad pensó que iba a morir y no podía irse sin gritar aquello que había sentido por años de odio y desprecio a sí mismo. — Teniente Dan — Había sido una noche demasiada agitada, pero la pregunta nunca se había ido de su mente en realidad, aún cuando había sentido que no iba a poder contar la situación. El gesto de que siguiera hablando que le hizo el teniente, fue lo que necesitaba para lanzar su pregunta — ¿Es usted mi alma gemela? Alzó la mirada sorprendido ante aquella pregunta, sentado en su silla de rueda, preparando las redes para pescar, las cuales se habían terminado por deslizar entre sus dedos debido a la pregunta que ese bobo le había hecho. Nunca había creído que ese día llegaría, sólo había pensado que Forrest Gump seguiría ignorando que era la única persona a la cual le podía corresponder su marca de alma gemela de todas las personas que conocía. — Sí, Forrest — Admitió finalmente, ¿qué más podía decir?, nada más que la verdad. No podía seguir mintiendo a aquel hombre sobre lo de su alma gemela, ambos estaban hechos el uno para el otro. Se habían salvado de distintas maneras, se cuidaban sin siquiera notarlo en realidad, siempre habían sido una constante en la vida del contrario. Desde que se encontraron en Vietnam, habían estado en un ir y venir, siempre sus caminos se terminaban cruzando de una u otra forma, eran almas gemelas y nadie podía negar eso. — Había enfermado gravemente, estaba muriendo y lo sabía, pero no había querido avisar a su querido hijo, que siempre había sido la luz de sus ojos, a quién siempre había buscado proteger de todo lo malo del mundo, pero el mundo era mucho más que Alabama simplemente. Pero el tiempo la había alcanzado y habían tenido que avisar a Forrest, pues debía despedirse de él, explicarle sobre su muerte, por qué debía aceptarla, era lo correcto y ella siempre había buscado hacer lo mejor para su niño. Estaba tendida en la cama, luego de que la revisara el doctor, sabía que no tenía demasiado tiempo, pero al menos quería pasar ese pequeño tiempo en compañía de quién había sido su corazón tantos años. Cuando lo vio entrar, vio como iba agitado, seguramente de correr, desde que podía mover sus rodillas de buena manera, siempre corría a cualquier lado, era la forma más rápida de llegar para él. Comenzó a explicarle sobre el destino, sobre la muerte y que estaba todo bien, aceptaba el destino que tenía, había amado ser la madre de ese niño que siempre se preocupo por ella, ese niño que tenía un casco militar en su muslo. Se preguntó si él finalmente encontraría a su alma gemela alguna vez, sí podría ser feliz, algo que ella nunca obtuvo con su alma gemela, pues no había sido un buen hombre, como su Forrest. — Perdón — Su mirada fue hacía la puerta de su habitación, tenía tomada la mano de su niño, pudiendo ver como la puerta se abría después del suave golpe y aquella voz, dejando ver a un hombre bastante desaliñado en silla de ruedas. Tenía la idea de quién era él, después de todo su hijo siempre le escribía sobre su compañero, el teniente Dan. — Señora Gump. — Usted debe ser el teniente Dan — Le dijo con una pequeña sonrisa, viendo como el hombre empujaba las ruedas de su silla con sus manos, para acercarse más a donde estaba ella recostada. — Es un placer conocerlo al fin... Forrest me ha hablado mucho de usted en sus cartas — Lo mismo digo, señora — La sonrisa que le dio Dan fue algo sutil, una pequeña que mostraba su simpatía, su agrado por ella, aunque igual estaba el nerviosismo por presentarse. En un principio, mientras conversaban de cualquier cosa no lo había notado, pero con el pasar de la charla pudo verlo, como el hombre había puesto su silla a un costado de donde estaba sentado Forrest, como de vez en cuando su brazo rozaba la rodilla de su hijo, de una manera demasiado familiar, de una manera en que se veía la confianza que había entre ellos, pero algo mucho más importante. Esos roces casuales, esas miradas que a veces se daban uno al otro, únicamente le dejaba ver como su niño había encontrado a quién sería su alma gemela, quién sería su compañero por el resto de su vida. Dan Taylor era un hombre que podía tener modales bruscos —que le habían quedado por su accidente en la guerra—, pero que miraba siempre a Forrest como si fuera lo único que importara en su mundo y seguramente era de esa forma. Él era un buen hombre para su hijo, uno que no lo abandonaría, uno que no estaba molesto por tener un alma gemela del mismo sexo... sólo importaba aquel amor y aquella protección que sentían el uno por otro, lo que dijera la gente en ese momento estaba simplemente de más. Ese fue el motivo por lo que su muerte no le afectaba tanto como había pensado que lo haría, después de todo ahora podría irse tranquila. Su hijo sería feliz, podría tener a alguien que lo amara y lo cuidara, lo cual era lo verdaderamente importante en toda la situación. — La muerte de la señora Gump ocurrió sin más y él sabía que Forrest no iba a tener el ánimo de volver al barco ni nada de eso, por lo cual simplemente invirtió el dinero de una buena forma, una compañía de tecnología que se veía verdaderamente prometedora, siendo que únicamente invirtió el dinero ahí y a los meses comenzó a ver las ganancias. Eran obscenamente ricos, tenían una gran fortuna, pero vivían en la casa que había sido heredada a Forrest, quién también le había dado parte del dinero que tenían a la familia de Bubba, después de todo aquel chico que había conocido en el ejército había sido quién origino la idea de todo aquello de los camarones. Por su parte había comenzado a hablar con especialistas, para verse unas prótesis, porque maldición, simplemente no podía seguir arrastrándose por la casa en los lugares donde no pudiera pasar con su silla de ruedas y aunque amaba demasiado a aquel bobo —aunque no solían decirlo mucho, pero ambos sabían lo que sentía el uno por el otro—, su orgullo, al menos aquello que aún conservaba, no le permitía a Forrest ayudarlo en las cosas más simples. Esa noche ambos estaban afueras sentados en el columpio que estaba en el pequeño pórtico de la casa, un columpio que seguramente tendría muchos más años que el mismo hombre a su lado y que seguramente permanecería ahí por mucho tiempo más, pensó, siendo que sin poder evitarlo apoyó su cabeza en el hombro de Forrest suspirando. Habían pasado demasiadas cosas juntos, habían casi muerto juntos más de una vez —Vietnam y con el maldito tornado—, pero a pesar de todo aquello ahí seguían ambos, uno al lado del otro, que era lo que realmente le importaba en la vida. Sin pensarlo demasiado le dio un pequeño beso en los labios al hombre, era de noche y en realidad nadie estaba en los alrededores de aquella casa, nadie nunca se iba a meter ahí, menos tan de noche y si los veían le importaba simplemente una mierda, estaba con su maldita alma gemela y tenía derecho de hacer aquello. — Ya es hora de ir a dormir, Forrest — Le murmuró cuando cortó con suavidad el besó, viendo como el hombre lo miraba con una sonrisa más boba de lo usual, una sonrisa que le daba siempre que lo besaba. — Sí, teniente Dan — Aquello era algo que nunca había podido cambiar, que le dijera únicamente por su nombre y no por \"teniente\", pero con el paso de los años se había acostumbrado y simplemente sonrió. Sí, podría haber muerto en la guerra, luchando para proteger a su país, como había pensado desde que había sido un niño y le habían contado la historia sobre su familia, como sus antepasados habían sido todos soldados que protegían al país, lo había deseado, pero ahora por nada del mundo cambiaría estar con su alma gemela por morir en la jungla solo.

Forrest Gump and Jenny Curran were watching the telecast of America's Bicentennial. \"You done watching it?\" asked Jenny, rising from her easy chair. The simpleton of a man beside her shook his head. \"I'm going to bed.\" She kissed his temple, and was just fiddling with her nightgown on the way up the stairs when Forrest's voice pinged out from the foyer. \"Will you marry me?\" Jenny stopped dead on the banister and turned to face him, her expression almost sad. Forrest couldn't look her in the eye, couldn't bear her answe, even as he vouched for himself: \"I'd make a nice husband, Jenn-ay.\" \"You would, Forrest,\" Jenny finally sighed out her concession. Silence. \"But you won't marry me,\" Forrest finished the thought. Jenny shook her head. \"You don't wanna marry me.\" She was a pathetic former drug addict. She didn't deserve someone so sweet and pure as Forrest as a husband. \"Why don't you love me, Jenn-ay?\" Forrest almost whispered, whimpered. Jenny tried to find the words to explain, but couldn't. So Forrest chose an explanation of his own. \"I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is!\" And he headed out onto the front porch beyond the screen door, hands on his hips. The rain poured heavily that night. Forrest lay awake, alone in his room. All at once, the storm door leading onto the patio balcony opened, and there stood Jenny in her nightgown, her gaze on him intense. In one fluid motion, she climbed into bed with him, as if she was a wife coming to bed with her husband. Then she continued the propulsion, until she was straddling Forrest. \"Jenn-ay...\" Forrest whimpered nervously. \"Forrest, I do love you,\" Jenny confessed in a whisper. Then, she kissed his lips softly, just a chaste peck. As if she was unsure herself. All at once, Forrest rose up his body to meet her, to press his lips to hers in an even deeper kiss, which she returned. Forrest's arms slowly wound about her, eventually holding Jenny in a tight embrace. But as she kissed him back with tongue, she had no intention of moving anyway. Except once, but only a shift to remove her nightgown, pull it over her head and cast it to the floor, before her bare back settled on top of Forrest again and she resumed kissing him. Forrest's hands now splayed across her bare back as Jenny wriggled above him, did her best to please him - she didn't even know if he'd been with anyone else, or if he had sweetly saved himself for her. The couple made love... Forrest was still asleep as Jenny emerged in her hippie wear through the first-floor front door the next morning. The cab waited for her at the base of the Gump compound. The driver loaded her stuff inside. \"Hope you're not running away,\" he observed. Jenny glanced back to the house only once.\"I'm not running,\" but she seemed to be telling herself that, as she left the buck-naked man still asleep upstairs. But what she didn't realize as she drove out of Forrest's life yet again, is that this time, he had left a piece of him with her. Inside of her...

From his station at the entrance, Peter watched the man, dressed in a cream colored linen suit, white Nike shoes on his feet, cross the court toward him. The new arrival was hesitant. Moving carefully, mindful of his footing. His head turning, eyes a little wide. It was very common. Understandably so. Some people, especially the ones who had been dealing with a lengthy illness, had had time to grow accustomed to the idea, even to welcome it. They were much less hesitant. Some of them knew exactly where they were and their smiles were wide, their steps light. They had been waiting for this for a long, long time. Others, though, people like the man coming toward him, were confused. Sometimes they weren't sure how they had come to be where they now found themselves. Some even had no memory of anything before that moment. They only knew that this, right here, was not where they had just been. A few carefully chosen questions from Peter, a little gentle prodding, usually brought the memories flooding back. And with the memories came realization, often followed by relief, or joy, maybe gratitude. But more often came regret, or shame, sometimes deservedly so, or protestations of unfairness, of not being ready. Many times, new arrivals had come from a situation where tensions were running high, adrenaline pumping furiously through their bodies, maybe due to exhilaration, maybe to fear, or anger. Then, in the twinkling of an eye, the situation changed. The man or woman was suddenly, instantly, somewhere...else. The disorientation could be overwhelming; Peter knew that. He had been through it himself. What the man was seeing now was different than what Peter saw. He wasn't seeing the court. Only Peter saw the court as it really was. What arrivals saw was different for each of them. Peter had suddenly found himself standing in a sunny, green field, bordered by a tree-shaded stream and surrounded by low hills spread with wildflowers. What arrivals saw was dependent on many things. Things they had been taught as children or had experienced later in their lives. It had to do with history and geography and culture and family, all filtered through a series of lessons, lessons that sometimes took the whole of their lives to learn, to understand. And there were those who never learned the lessons, never reached the understanding. But there were some, some who seemed to be born with it, although the world did not see it in them. So Peter patiently watched the man come. He knew he would figure it out eventually, if perhaps he hadn't already. This man was special, even in a place like this. I been mixed up a few times in my life. Okay, I been mixed up a lots o' times in my life. But I never been mixed up like I was right then. I didn't know how I got there, but I was of a sudden at Mama's house, just walkin' through the gate, 'cept there never was no gate, just a openin' in that ol' brick fence. An' it hadn't been Mama's house for a long time. It was my house after she passed, then it was mine and Jennie's an' little Forrest's house, an' then just me an' little Forrest, an' then just me ag'in. But just then at that moment, it felt like comin' home to Mama's house, and I didn't know how that could be. The grass looked an' smelt like I had just mowed it an' it made me a little proud 'cuz I was good at mowin' that lawn, but as I was walkin' acrost it to the porch, still tryin' to figure out how I'd come to be there, I seen this feller standin' on the top step. I didn't recognize him, not at all, but he was lookin' at me, like he knowed me real well, kinda smilin' an' warm like. \"Hello, Forrest,\" he says to me. \"Hello.\" I said it careful, 'cuz would you believe sometimes when folks pretend t' know you, they's fixin' to cheat you? \"Do you know where you are?\" he asked me. I took a careful look around. It was as plain as day where I was, an' I figured maybe he was lost or somethin', but if he was, how did he know who I was? \"How do you know who I am?\" \"I know all about you. I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time, Forrest,\" he says. I didn't know what to say to that, so I didn't say nothin'. \"Come up here and sit with me, Forrest,\" he said an' he waved me up on the porch to the wicker chairs where Jenny an' me used to sit an' drink sweet tea an' watch fireflies of an eve'nin'. We settled in an' he says, \"Tell me, Forrest, what do you remember before you found yourself coming through the gate into the yard?\" I had to think about that for a bit. It was all kind of a jumble, but after a few minutes, it started to come back. \"I think I was watchin' tennis on TV,\" I said. Then I remembered. \"No, no, it wasn't on TV, it was real life. I was watchin' a real life tennis tournament.\" \"Do you remember where?\" \"Uh...it was at that National Tennis Center, the one in New York City.\" I remembered more as I said it. \"It was the U. S. Open. I got invited on account o' me bein' a national an' Olympic ping pong champion an' all, an' a feller named Lleyton Hewitt beat Pete Sampras, an' folks was kinda sorry for Pete 'cuz he was thirty. I thought that was funny, 'cuz thirty ain't somethin' to be sorry for. An' the day before that, them sisters Venus and Serena was just a-hammerin' on each other, back an' forth, back an' forth, gruntin' and cryin' out, an' Venus won, but when it came time for the picture-takin', they was both smilin' like they each won.\" The feller smiled hisself. \"That was a good match, wasn't it? Do you remember anything else?\" \"I remember how crowded it was. New York is always so crowded, but I kinda like it, all the jostlin' and bustlin',\" I said. \"Oh, I do remember somethin' else! The folks that invited me to the tennis tournament fixed it so I got to go to Madison Square Garden to see that nice boy, the one that used to sing with his brothers. Michael! Michael…Jackson! He was havin' some kind of a anniversary or somethin'. But it was funny 'cuz they was more other folks singin' his songs than he was. My favorite was the one gal, Gladys Knight, who sang about takin' the midnight train back to Georgia, which ain't even one of Michael's songs, but I didn't care. That song made me homesick for Greenbow, even though it ain't in Georgia.\" \"Why do you suppose it made you homesick, Forrest?\" \"Because I couldn't go home yet. I had to go from New York to San Francisco, clean across the country. They was havin' the five year anniversary of the very first ever Bubba Gump Shrimp Comp'ny restaurant in Monterey an' I was supposed to…\" I stopped talkin'. When I get goin', it's hard sometimes to shut my mouth, but I shut it then. The feller in the other chair didn't say nothin', he just sorta watched me. \"I was on a plane.\" I jumped right up out of that chair. \"I was on a plane. We was flyin' from Newark on account of it havin' a direct flight to San Francisco.\" He still didn't say nothin'. I turned an' looked out acrost the yard an' down the lane, an' I wanted to run, fast, 'cuz all those folks on the plane, they was…was gonna… \"Forrest?\" I turned back to him, an' I sat back down, reeeal slow. An' I couldn't help myself, I started bawlin' like a big baby, 'cuz I knowed now where I was. An' I was more mixed up than ever. \"Are you St. Peter?\" I asked him. \"Yes, Forrest.\" \"Am I in Heaven?\" \"Yes, Forrest.\" An' I cried more. An' he says, \"You're crying ? There's no crying in Heaven!\" An' he smiled like he said somethin' funny, but whatever joke he was makin' sailed right over my head, like most of 'em do. He got serious lookin' ag'in. \"Why are you crying, Forrest?\" \"I don't think I maybe should be here.\" \"Really? And why is that?\" An' so I told him about what happened on the plane. We was flyin' for most an hour when up in the front where the first class folks sit an' where I usually sit on account of me bein' rich an' all, but my flight got booked too late an' first class was full, suddenly up front we heard yellin' an' fightin' an' fearful noise, an' one of the flight attendants went headed up the aisle to see what all the commotion was about when a feller with a red bandana around his head an' a thing belted around his waist come back through the curtain pushin' some folks ahead of him an' sayin' they had taken over the plane an' he had hisself a bomb . 'Bout then the plane felt like a big hand was suddenly just shovin' it down out of the sky. The feller with the red bandana an' the flight attendant an' everybody got jostled off they's feet an' everybody started to screamin' all at once. Well, it felt like we fell for a long time 'til the plane got straightened out an' the feller with the bandana got up ag'in an' told all of us to get back to the back of the plane. We still could hear yellin' and bangin' from the front an' heard some screamin' an' a couple of the fellers back where we was started headin' up that way to first class, but the feller with the bomb made like he had somethin' in his hand an' said to get back or he would blow up the plane. They come back to where the rest of us was bunched up, and then the captain come on the speakers an' said to be calm an' there was a bomb an' we was gonna land, but we didn't land. The plane started makin' a big ol' turn instead. The pilot came over the loudspeaker ag'in and said be calm an' we would be okay, but some folks back where we was started grabbin' they's cell phones an' the air phones from the back of the seats an' tryin' to call somebody to tell them what was happenin'. When they did start gettin' hold of people, the folks they got a hold of was sayin' that a whole mess of planes had been hijacked and crashed into them tall skyscraper buildings at the World Trade Center, and even the Pentagon. Folks was takin' turns with the phones an' talkin' to their families an' such an' everybody was sayin' the same thing, that there was attacks bein' made an' nobody knew what was happenin' or who was doin' it. They thought maybe our plane was gonna be crashed into somewhere like the White House or maybe even the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Well, I been to the White House a ton o' times, met me some Pres'dents, an' I didn't want no plane crashin' into it, 'specially no plane I was on. An' I remembered that night, maybe the best night ever, so long ago when Jenny an' me walked arm-in-arm all over our nation's capitol, talkin' an' lookin' at the monuments an' such. I didn't like think' about a plane crashin' into any of those special places. I kept picturin' me an' Jenny standin' on the steps at the memorial for Pres'dent Lincoln and seein' a big ol' plane comin' right at us. One of the fellers held out a phone to me, an' he said his name was Jeremy, an' I said \"I'm Forrest, people call me Forrest,\" an' he said I should call someone. I only had me one person to call, an' that was little Forrest, who ain't little no more, but I still call him that, but he didn't answer his phone. I had to just leave him a message. I said, \"Hey, Forrest,\" an' I had to stop for a minute on account of I couldn't talk, then I said, \"It's Daddy. I just want you to know that I love you very much, an' I'm proud, so proud of you, an' when I git back, we're gonna go bass fishin' ag'in.\" An' I hung up. I didn't know what else to say. I didn't want him worryin' none. Some of the other passengers was talkin' about what they should do an' they decided we had to take control of that plane. They thought the bomb was a pretend one. The flight attendants started heatin' up boilin' water in the kitchen in the back an' they rolled out one of them food carts to use for crashin' down the door to the cockpit. The feller in the red bandana could see we was up to somethin' an' he went back through the curtain an' was yellin' to somebody. Jeremy says to me, \"Forrest, that feller with the bandana is gonna try an' stop us. We can't let him do that. We have to get him out of the way of the cart, or a lot of people are going to die.\" I'm not a smart man, but I knowed he was right. We was about set an' we was just waitin' on a feller named Todd. He put down the phone he was talkin' on an' says to all of us, \"Are we ready? Let's roll!\" I went first ahead of the cart, an' somebody was callin' out', \"Run, Forrest!\" like I been hearin' all my life, seems like. An' I ran. I went through that curtain like it was…well, like it was a curtain…an' there was two fellers with red bandanas and they had them utility knives in their hands an' I seen at least two bodies on the floor, a woman an' a man', an' they had blood on them. That was all I had time to see. One of them hijackers took a swipe at me with his knife as I run past, but I was set on the one in front of the door to the cockpit. I was thinkin' maybe I could smash him through the cockpit door myself, an' I tell you what, as scared as I was, I could see he was scared too. He shoulda been. I was goin' fast an' I hit him hard, hard enough that I saw light from the cockpit around the edges of the door when we hit it, but it still didn't open. I grabbed him and swung him out of the way an' he was slashin' at me with the knife as we went down to the floor in that little space. People was screamin' and I felt hot water spray on me, an' there was all kinds of shovin' and commotion behind me, but all I could do was hold that feller down with one hand an' hit him with the other while he tried to cut me. The plane was rockin' an' heavin' but that didn't matter to me 'cuz we was already on the floor an' there wasn't no room for us to go anywhere else. I'm not sure how long it was-couldn't'a been too long-an' I finally realized he wasn't movin' no more, an' I looked an' the cockpit door was open. Two more fellas with red bandanas was in the pilot seats and two or three of the passengers was rasslin' with them, tryin' to get at the controls. One of the hijackers kept yellin', \"No, let it go, let it go !\" I crawled through the door on my hands an' knees an' was tryin' to reach in an' pull his hands away from the controls so whoever was standin' over me could grab them an' the sound the plane was makin' was getting louder an' louder, just like in the movies, an' finally we got that hijacker away from the controls an' I figured we was gonna be okay. The passenger, I don't remember which one it was, grabbed the yoke thing, an' I said, \"Pull it up.\" An' then...I was here in the lane, walkin' through the gate. St. Peter, he just sat an' looked at me an' then out over the yard whilst I blew my nose on my hankie, an' then back at me for a few minutes 'til the tears stopped runnin' down my face. \"Why is it you don't think you should be here, Forrest?\" \"Because just a little bit ago, I was tryin' to kill a man with my bare fist. The Bible says to 'love thy neighbor, an', 'Thou shalt not kill.' I figger I broke those commandments, an' I don't think you want somebody like me in Heaven.\" St. Peter smiled again. \"The Bible also says 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' That's you, Forrest. You proved it on that plane. You've proved it more than once in your life. \"It isn't a matter of whether your good deeds outweigh your bad deeds. It never has been. It never will be. Most of the people who feel they're worthy to be here, aren't. In fact, most of the people who feel unworthy are much, much closer than the others. It isn't a matter of feeling whether you're worthy or not. It's a matter of knowing the truth of Who God is, and how it relates to the truth about you, and what you've done with it. You are absolutely welcome here.\" I sat quiet for a bit in my wicker chair, then I sniffled once, an' wondered somethin'. \"Is my best good friend Bubba here?\" He smiled ag'in. \"Yes.\" \"Lieutenant Dan?\" \"Legs and all.\" I wanted to ask, but I was afraid, because I knowed she done lots o' bad things before. \"Is she…is Jenny here?\" \"They're all here, Forrest. Do you know why?\" \"No.\" \"Because of you, Forrest. You showed them the truth about God. Your example of unconditional love and sacrifice and unwavering faith revealed a truth that they wanted for themselves and they took that truth about Him and looked at the truth about themselves, and realized what they needed to do, and they did it.\" I wondered somethin' else. \"Do they have Dr. Pepper in Heaven?\" St. Peter laughed an' slapped his leg an' stood up. \"Get up, Forrest Gump. Let's go on in and I'll show you what we've got here.\" And he put his arm around my shoulders, an' that's the story of how I come to Heaven, an' that's all I have to say about that.

He had been happily downing a bottle of whiskey when He showed up on T.V. and made a fool out of himself. He didn't know what made him more angry, The fact that Gump received a Medal of Honor, or the T.V people taking advantage of him on National T.V. Dan blamed the booze for inviting Gump to stay at his place for New Years. It had nothing to do with the happy look on Gumps face when he discovered Dan after the T.V. show. Or the lack of pity in his eyes as he looked down at him. Dan didn't even think when he invited the girls back to the apartment for the night. He was so occupied with Lenore, doing the only thing that made him feel alive when a crash had distracted him. He had looked over to see Carla picking herself up from the ground and Forest standing up and just looking at the ground. \"What is your friend's problem! He lose his package in the war or something\" yelled Carla grabbing her purse. \"What is your friend stupid?\" asked the girl on his lap as she continued to kiss his face. \"What did you call him\" growled Dan grabbing her arms and forced her to arm's length, glaring at her. \"I said is your friend stupid or something\" the girl whined. Dan picked the girl up by the waist and threw her off his lap and onto the bed. \"Don't call him stupid!\" he yelled. All thoughts of a good time flew out of his head. No one insulted one of his men, no one. How dare she call Forest stupid! What did that two-bit whore know about anything. Lt. Dan had called Forest every name in the book, but he never called him stupid. Dan knew that Forest was different, slower than normal. But he was worth more than most people. He had changed Dan's destiny, the son of a bitch, but he had saved the rest of the platoon. He had run back into the jungle moments before an airstrike to bring back a colored boy. During these changing times, how many young white men from the South, none the less, would run back into the fire to save a wounded colored boy. Forest was diamond in the rough, and even a drunk, bitter, cripple man could see that. Carla and Lenore left after that, insulting him as he kicked them out. Calling him every name in the book, cripple, freak show. The worse was when he had fallen out of the chair and they had just laughed hurling insults at him. Dan just wished he could remain on the floor where he had fallen and just give up on life, like he often wished. But he was reminded he wasn't alone when a pair of strong, yet gentle hands grabbed his shoulders, ready to pick him up. It was his pride that forced Dan to wave Forest away when he tried to help. It was the commanding officer in him that refused to allow one of his men to see his weakness. It was with great effort that he was able to haul himself up into his chair. And he was thankful that Gump had stayed where he had ordered him. When accidents had happened when he was still in the hospital, the Doctors and Nurses had not let him help himself, no matter how he protested. They helped him up with kind words and gentle hands, something that Dan despised. He was a soldier and they had treated him as a child. \"I'm sorry Lt. Dan for ruining ur New Years Eve party\" apologized Forest. \"But she tasted like cigarettes.\" There it was, not the apology but the sign of respect. Gump didn't call him Dan or Taylor, or even cripple. It was always Lieutenant Dan, in the same respectful tone he had used in the Army. Gump was the only person who still treated him as a person, not something broken. Dan slowly wheeled around the apartment and looked out the window, \"Happy New Year's Gump\" Dan said softly. Not long afterwards Forest went to bed on the couch in the room. Dan had not moved from his spot in front of the window. He was not tired, he knew if he did fall asleep his dreams would be filled with faces of the dead from the war. That's all he ever dreamed about was the war, the heat, and the rain, and the sound of dying cries of his men. He even had dreams of the man sleeping on his couch dying. He might have be in the United States but his whole life was back in the jungle. All his life he knew he would die in battle, just like every man in his family had, fighting for a cause that was worthy. But now that had been denied to him, he didn't know what to do with himself. He never planned on surviving, never planned for the future. Dan looked over to where Forest was sleeping. His face was peaceful. Dan didn't understand how this man could move on from the war. Gump had plans. Well, Dan chuckled, only Forest Gump would feel honored bound to keep a promise to a dead man and buy himself a shrimping boat. Dan couldn't believe that he had promised the fool he would be his first mate if he ever did get a boat. Dan didn't notice his head dipping further and further onto his chest, his mind full of the images of the open ocean. Were it didn't matter if you had legs or not as he felt the salty air flow around him. For the first time since he returned home, Dan Taylor's dreams were not full of destruction and death. But of hope and freedom of the seas, with a man whose goodness showed through him like a beacon. On their ship there would be no people calling them cripple or stupid, they would both be free.

Tears rolled silently down his tanned cheeks. He was thinking about the only human bean he had ever truly loved, Forrest Gump. He sobbed gently while thinking about having legs. He didn't need them though, he was happy being Mr. Gump's stumps. It was quiet. Oh how he missed them all the same. He wanted legs. He wanted Forrest, where was he? He was running. Running to him, lovingly. Running for him, to make up for the fact he ruined his life. Fucking Gump, but also fucking Gump. But lieutenant Dan did not know this. Dan was just sad about life, he had no penis. He looked down sadly at the ken doll-like crotch. He broke down as the sun reflected of the shiny curve, this non-existent was too much, he was going to have to try to commit suicide. Again. The tears caught in his hair, slowly melding them into dreadlocks. He lay down on his side, preparing himself for the sweet release of death. He tucked his arms into his chest and began to roll. Roll all the way to the edge of the cliff. A single last tear fell from his left eye as he tumbled to his doom. BUT, little did he know, Forrest was fast approaching, though he was a little slow in the mind, he knew straight away what Dan was going to do, so propelled himself further and further to reach his lover. He shot through the grass faster than a bullet, he slowly extended his tender arms to catch his rolling lover. Forrest screamed. \"AGH. NO. LIEUTENANT DAN.

Forrest cradled his aging lover in his arms, rocking him back and forth, shaking and crying from the shock. Lieutenant Dan didn't look very happy.

About seven years go'…my Jenny was real sick. Doctors said she wouldn't live one year longer. She did. Some new type of, what they like to call, medical technology , helped her. Her, me, and Forrest Jr. been' real happy together. We live in Greenbow, Alabama. In mama's house. Forrest been going to school. He's real smart. His IQ isn't 75 like mine was. That's all I have to say bout' that. That's all I have to say for the day.\" . . . . Forrest's fingers gently touched the cracked leather cover of his brown journal and he slowly enclosed his simple, but loving thoughts. The cover of his journal appeared as though a fault had slipped and an earthquake had struck the leather surface. Forrest was plastered to the chair as his eyes appeared to be plastered to the window…looking out…day dreaming. Forrest would often sit in front of the window, observing the beautiful and verdant environment of Greenbow, Alabama. A high-pitched and excited voice in the distance yelled, \"No mom! I'm going to get dad! I'll run as fast as lightning!\" Immediately after that voice and the sound of excited footsteps reached the vicinity of Forrest's ears, his eyes smiled while the edges of his mouth subtly curled up. \"DAD. DAD. We HAVE to go watch T.V.\" shouted Forrest Jr. with eyes as wide as an owls'. \"Michael Jackson's performing Thriller . You have to see this!\" Forrest Jr. got a hold of his father's arm quickly and his father turned his head, coming to from his day dreams. Forrest Jr. was pulling his father like he was in a match of tug-a-war on the school playground and his father's arm was the rope. Looking like mice quickly jogging in an alley, Forrest and Forrest Jr. scurried to the living room to ensure the performance wouldn't be over the second they arrived. Jenny, Forrest's wife, had been saving a lot of money waiting tables at the local Greenbow Diner . Her pastel pink button-up uniform complemented her light rosy cheeks and made her shiny, white teeth illuminate when she smiled; this only helped increase her tips. Her presence gave off a sense of sweetness and strength which seemed to transfer from one heart to the next. Two weeks ago, Jenny ran into Video Kingdom faster than a cheetah. She was carrying green dollar bills that were practically spilling out of her hands. That day she bought herself a well-earned Sony Television. Their family couldn't afford a television until the late eighties. It was a special day. Forrest and Forrest Jr. took one last leap into the premises of the living room as if they were fighting to cross the finish line of a marathon. Forrest Jr.'s fingers quickly curled as he stuck out his arms. His legs then began to move back and forth from left to right. He was doing the signature dance move of Thriller. The instant second his young eyes recognized the bedazzled glove on Michael Jackson's hand, his smile was shining as much as the million dollar glove was. \"Look! Look dad! Do you see what's covering his glove? Look how shiny it is! I gave him that idea!\" shouted Forrest Jr. while his legs acted as springs that were bouncing up and down and up and down. . . . Back in 1981, Forrest, Jenny, and Forrest Jr. took a trip to the big booming city of New York City. Forrest Junior's eyes were as bright as the flashing lights of the city when he saw the colors of Times Square. While walking down the street, Forrest Jr.'s feet would slow and he permanently had his head turned, getting caught up in the commotion, not looking at his parents straight ahead. The commotion was slowing him down; life was whizzing around him while he was in his own world, observing many different encounters on the streets. Suddenly, Forrest Jr.'s slow feet came to a halt and he turned his whole body to the left, staring in the alley. It was as if he was in a trance and the silhouette of a man in the alley had a gravitational force that was pulling him in. \"Forrest Jr., get over here now!\" shouted Jenny in a frantic voice. He kept moving towards the alley. Jenny and Forrest chased after him. Once they grabbed a hold of his hand, Forrest said in an uneasy voice, \"Forrest Jr., please stay right by our side. Please. Don't go running away like that ever gain'.\" There was a man with his fingers curled up and his arms sticking out. He was dancing; moving side to side. Forrest Jr. urged his parents to go over there. So, they went. Dancing and singing in the middle of an alley was Michael Jackson. Forrest Jr. stared and said, \"I like your dance moves, sir.\" He then looked to the ground and saw a shiny object that was reflecting in the eerie darkness. He picked it up and found it was a small rock that was literally sparkling the tint of silver. He walked over to Michael Jackson, who he didn't know was famous (he was a young boy), and he handed him the rock. Mr. Jackson stuck out his hand, which had a white glove on it, and stared down at the rock the boy had placed on the glove. \"Thank you young sir. Wow. Look at it! It makes the glove beautiful.\" said Mr. Jackson, staring with wide eyes at the boy as if he had just met Albert Einstein. Forrest Jr. smiled, turned around, and grabbed his parent's hands. As they walked away, Jenny would slowly turn her head around, as if she had just encountered the strangest experience, trying to see if that moment was a hallucination or reality. . . . Now dancing in the living room many years later, swinging his body the same way the famous Michael Jackson did in the alley, Forrest Jr., Forrest, and Jenny were amazed to see an extravagantly bedazzled glove on Mr. Jackson's hand. Jenny, leaning against the frame of the door, held her two hands together; it was as if she wasn't able to pass on love to anyone currently by holding their hands, so she held her own. Her curly blonde locks were held perfectly in place and pink lipstick sweetened her subtle smile. Her eyes were locked on Forrest and Forrest Jr. Standing approximately two inches away from the television, Forrest Jr. was wearing a blue plaid shirt, just like his daddy. Grinning from ear to ear at the television, Forrest Jr. was full of optimism and hope; he also got that from his daddy. One thing he didn't get from his daddy was his intelligence. Regardless of his intelligence level, Forrest had a huge ability to understand and feel love. He loved Jenny, he loved Forrest Jr., and he loved mama, who passed away about ten years ago due to old age. He was also great a defending and protecting his loved ones. He wasn't the smartest, but he sure was full of love. \"I only can hope Forrest Jr. gets his father's loving characteristics. He's a smart boy and that would only make him more intelligent,\" Jenny thought to herself while still leaning against the door frame. As the Michael Jackson music video quickly faded out, commercials began. With the performance just ending, Forrest Jr.'s attention was focused on the T.V. still. A commercial began advertising a trip to Europe. The mouths of both Forrest Jr. and Forrest dropped immediately. Forrest Jr. whirled around to face his mother and excitedly whispered, \"Mom. Mom! Did you see that castle? Let's go there!\" While picking up toys on the floor and half-heartedly listening, Jenny hesitantly responded, \"Oh yeah honey. That looks like a great place. Now let's go eat supper.\" ","Summary":" \"It's the exact year of 1989. About seven years go'…my Jenny was real sick.

Enjoy! ... \"Don't call him stupid!\" Dan exploded, pushing her off of him. She bounced on the bed, looking across at him with confusion and consternation. She and her companion gathered up their clothes, screaming insults; he roared at them to get out as they opened the door. As he pointed, he overshot, lost his balance, ended up falling out of his chair face-first on the carpet. The indignity coursed through him as the harpies half-shrieked, half-laughed a final chorus of \"Loser, freak!\" and slammed the door. Forrests' footsteps fell near. Dan pushed himself up as Forrest bent down. \"No,\" he growled, waving an arm, and Forrest reluctantly backed away. Slowly, little by little, he made his way back into the wheelchair. When he got there, he slumped, the angry strength draining out of him as quickly as it had poured in. \"I'm sorry I ruined your New Years' Eve party, Lieutenant Dan,\" came Forrests' uncertain, apologetic drawl, \"She tasted like cigarettes.\" \"Lieutenant\" Dan snorted a little despite himself, wheeling to the window.

With every scream of his protesting shoulder muscles as he hauled himself back into his wheelchair, with every uncomfortable sideways glance looking down on him, pitying him, he ground his teeth and swore a blue streak under his breath, calling that goddamn idiotic fool every kind of obscene, profane, disgusting insult he could think of. And somehow it was still never enough; never satisfying to have his wrath and his rage fall only on the deaf air around him. It left him feeling just as empty and hollow as before, with the pent-up fury and frustration and the knowledge…always the heavy, oppressive knowledge that he was accomplishing nothing this way. Going in circles. So when he ran into Gump again, it was just as well. But coming face-to-face with the fucker who'd started it all — and ended it all, incidentally…and brought all his ramblings of fate and destiny screeching to a halt — he didn't swear. Didn't pour out his anger and humiliation and resentment, though a large part of him wanted to slap him right in his brainless face if only he could reach it. There was nothing to say, but he spoke just the same; called out to his previous subordinate when he could have just let him walk on by, and engaged him when he could have just wheeled right past and never had to see his stupid mug again. Not like his aggression would be well-spent on someone who would probably take even a personal insult to his mother lying down. He confronted him anyway, advanced on him in a way he hoped was menacing and challenged him for all the good fortune that had come raining down on him, utterly and completely missing its mark. Where would Gump have been without him anyway? Definitely not getting decorated by the fucking president of the United States. He'd intended to leave once he'd said his piece; roll right away from that slack-jawed fool and never look back, but it turned out gravity and ice didn't mix well with turning metal wheels, and once again the world decided to screw him over, sending him skidding, and then toppling and rolling down the incline in the pavement. And like the freakishly obedient puppy he'd been in the army, of course Gump came scrambling after him, offering a helping hand that Dan angrily shoved away. Once he'd righted himself — and no, he hadn't needed Gump to turn his wheelchair back over and wipe the chips of ice from the seat, thank you very much — he somehow felt worse than before he'd started to slip. He could as easily have ditched Gump as swallow a bucket of nails after that — must have been his damn integrated sense of duty playing up like an old wound — and ruefully he'd invited him to stay with him for awhile. Not like Gump had much of a place to go, at the current moment. So here he was. In his grubby hotel room, strewn with empty beer bottles and cigarette butts, staring out at the city and very aware of the pair of blithely inquisitive eyes trained on his back. \"You can sit down, you know,\" he said gruffly, drumming his fingers on the rim of one of his wheels. That was a relatively new habit; he'd never been much of a fidgeter before. He looked over his shoulder long enough to see Gump glance around, and then move over to perch gingerly on the edge of the entirely unremarkable single bed taking up most of one wall, as if the sheets might reach up and attack him. \"Lieutenant Dan…\" Gump began tentatively, trailing off as if asking for permission to speak. Sighing resignedly — he'd signed up for whatever the hell this awkward encounter turned out to be, after all — Dan turned sharply and rolled over to the bed, cursing between his teeth as the crappy carpet caught in his wheels. \"If you're gonna ask why I told you to come with me, I don't have a damn clue,\" he muttered, \"Call it a favor, if you want, considering…\" Well yes, considering. Considering a great many things, but he wasn't about to list any of them here. This late-night hotel chat was cheesy enough as it was, by virtue of itself. \"Lieutenant Dan, I ain't never meant fer…\" Gump burst out in a rush, but then he hesitated, fiddling with the sheets on either side of him, \"I know you're still mad at me. 'Bout the medal, an' your legs an' such.\" Dan let out a breath again and ran an exhausted hand over his face. He still didn't know how Gump managed to speak so bluntly, so unreserved. Some would call it admirable; his tendency to stick to the truth and give it to people straight no matter the circumstances. Personally he thought it was plain stupid. He left himself wide open, not only to attack, but to manipulation, and very clearly had already been played and manipulated before. But none of that registered with Gump, no, he was stubborn to a fault and resolutely refused to learn a lesson no matter how many times it turned around and bit him in the ass. It was frustrating, not only as his former commanding officer, but as his fr….well, as his associate. \"….Fuck it,\" he said, short and flat, crossing his arms and looking Gump up and down, \"No use dwellin' on that crap, what happened happened. It fucking sucks, but it happened. Not like you were holding the medal or the saw anyway.\" \"…Whaddya mean, Lieutenant Dan?\" Gump asked patiently, blinking at him. Dan let out a breath that could have constituted for a laugh, \"I mean I don't blame your sorry ass for the screwed up state of my life. It was just easier to, since yours seems to be all sunshine and rainbows by comparison. I forgive you, goddammit.\" Gump was silent for a long moment, expression open but unchanging, and after a long moment, he stammered out a single word. \"O-okay.\" This time, Dan really did let out a laugh, harsh and bark-like, but grimly amused nonetheless, \"Okay?\" he echoed, rolling a little closer to him with a single push of his hands, \"I'm over here bleeding out my fuckin' heart and all you've got to say is 'okay'?\" Gump fidgeted, \"Yes, Lieutenant Dan.\" Edging still closer, Dan squinted at him critically before simply shaking his head in defeat, \"You….are something else, I'll give you that.\" There was no denying that simple fact; Gump was different. He'd only disobeyed Dan's orders once, when it really counted, and he and the men who had been spared in that ambush back in Vietnam owed him their lives for that. When he couldn't protect his own platoon, Gump pulled through for him and then some. And yeah, he'd suffered, he still did, but he'd broken a chain of senseless death that he'd thought he'd been doomed to inherit, and the cost of his pride was worth the survival of half a dozen otherwise dead men, he supposed. He felt a sudden, disgustingly overpowering urge to thank Gump. For every little thing. But when the words rose in his throat like bile, he painfully swallowed them back down, struggling internally while Gump looked on, oblivious to his dilemma. \"Forrest,\" he managed, hating how strained his voice sounded even to his own ears. Immediately, that got Gump's attention, and he cocked his head slightly, \"Hm?\" \"Come over here.\" As he expected, Gump didn't hesitate to follow the command; scooting closer with the same rather bleary, confused look. \"What is it, Lieutenant Dan?\" he asked slowly. Reaching up, Dan pulled him down to eye-level by the back of his neck, searching those freaking innocent eyes, \"I want to give you something,\" he said, matter-of-fact, direct like he was still giving orders, \"Okay?\" Gump visibly swallowed, something like fight-or-flight instinct warring on his face, \"…Okay…\" Wrestling a moment longer with the impossible sentiment, losing a battle with himself, Dan swallowed as well and leaned up to brush their lips together. It was a confused, hesitant gesture, but somehow made more sense than anything he could have regurgitated through words. Gump though, went rigid and immediately jerked back, looking at once stunned and panicked, reaching up a hand to lightly touch his lower lip, and drawing it away shaking. It occurred to Dan that he might not even understand that; so little else of 'normal', proper behavior in society didn't seem to click with him. \"I don't hate you,\" he offered as supplication, maybe even an explanation for doing what he had, \"I'm not mad.\" Gump was quiet still, swinging his lower legs idly against the side of the bed, like a little kid. His eyebrows were furrowed, but he didn't necessarily seem troubled, just a uncomprehending and a little taken aback. \"Okay?\" Dan prompted, poising his hands on the rims of his wheels, prepared to back off. Gump wet his lips nervously, folding his hands in his lap and interlocking his fingers, \"Okay…\" A flicker of relief dawned, surprising Dan substantially. He hadn't thought he would be hinging so much on Gump's response…hoping he wasn't bothered or disgusted. So much else he'd done to him, with words and actions, had been angry and hateful, he would have liked to have one moment of understanding. Maybe gratitude, though that idea still rubbed him the wrong way. \"You're okay, right?\" he pressed, \"You look like shit.\" Gump didn't say anything, but nodded a few times numbly, looking through him. \"….Good,\" Dan said distantly….then; \"You sure?\" \"Yes, Lieutenant Dan,\" Gump said robotically, but a moment later, a little emotion and light bled back into his face, \"It's okay.\" Dan slumped back in his chair, closing his eyes wearily. That was supposed to have been easier, not more difficult than choking out a thank you. He supposed he'd made his bed back there, and he had to suck it up and lie in it. He nearly toppled himself over backwards in shock when he felt a tentative graze of lips against his own, eyes snapping open in shock. Gump pulled away after a second, indecisive, but thoughtful. So, there really was some activity going on in that head of his. \"What the hell was that about?\" Dan snapped, perhaps a little harshly. Gump recoiled instantly, but seemed to regain his composure…sort of…relatively quickly. \"I wanted t'….give you somethin' too, Lieutenant Dan. I wanted t' thank you.\" Dan blinked; so he did understand what the implication had been there? He was grudgingly impressed, he hadn't thought the fool had it in him. Allowing himself a tired grin — it felt like forever since he'd had anything resembling a smile on his face; the muscles felt disused and protested the job — he leaned back again and got comfortable in his chair. \"Would you mind showing me again? I think I missed it the first time…\" Was he really flirting with his former underling right now? With Clueless Gump, of all people? Gump looked bemused, but eventually it seemed to dawn on him what Dan was asking, and he returned the smile, a little waveringly, scooting closer to him again. \"Okay.\" ","Summary":" Every time Lieutenant Dan Taylor found himself crawling on the floor like a slug, he cursed the ver"},{"Movie":"Forrest Gump","Title":"Forrest Gump: 10 Years Later","Author":"Marissa of the Pen","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6459459","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I could run like no one's business, I'd never thought it would take me anywhere, especially places that I've been in my life. Jenny's gone. She's been gone for about 10 years now. Well, life went on, as everyone told me it would. My mama's gone, too. She's been gone longer than my Jenny's been. I've been through so much hell in my life, first with Bubba, then mama, then my Jenny. People always say \"That Forrest Gump. He's gone through so much. If I was him, I'd probably run away from it all, y'know, leave it all behind…\" Or something along those lines. I don't pay much attention to those people, they's trouble. But I haven't run away from that. There's too much to run away from. Little Forrest's all grown up, he's what I'm livin' for. He's about fifteen now, a typical teenage boy. He ain't got no girl under his belt, hasn't had one yet, and by that I mean a girlfriend. Never thought that I would never see a boy his age without one, but he does have this one best friend, slightly younger than him, same age though. Her name's Anna, long dark brown hair, blazing green eyes, the exact opposite of what Jenny was. I see 'em walkin' down Main Street, arm in arm, laughin' all the way. They's remind me of Jenny and I. I read the letter that he wrote to Jenny when he was five and it got me all chok'ed up. It said he missed her, the whole quote-n-quote nine yards. But then he said 'I'm a bit worried about Papa, he cries whenever he reads me Curious George and whenever I mention how much I wanna to learn 'bout Woodstock, he yells at me 'bout how much Woodstock kills, he says I'm too young to understand 'bout those kinda things but he doesn't know I'm above average in my class.' That's stuck with me through all of those 9-or 10- years he wrote the letter. I've kept it. I'd never thought my son could write letters like that even when he was five, considerin' what I was doin' when I was that. It's actually in my cadet uniform jacket pocket. I got it all fixed up and put in a special glass case. I've put pictures all over it, mostly of Jenny and me, Bubba, Dan, and obviously Little Forrest. Each year I sit at that bus stop on the anniversary of Jenny's death, waiting for hours on end, talking to the people who wait for the bus. I keep a large heart box next to me and each day I say \"My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump. Would you like a chocolate?\", take off the lid, and offer it to the man, woman, or couple sitting on the wooden bench and most of the time they would respond with a cheery thank you and eat the chocolate. Sometimes they would scowl mainly because they wouldn't like the flavor they had gotten. I don't mind it though, I don't care which flavor I get, chocolate is chocolate, it was Jenny's favorite. My mama always used to say \"Life was like a box of chocolates, y'never know what you're gonna get.\" I agree with that completely. You never know what you're going to get when it comes to life, it's usually something that's goin' to change you. I've felt as though everythin's gone crazy 'round here. There's been murder 'round here. Especially in Anna's neighborhood. I hear Little Forrest talkin' 'bout it every night at dinner (most of the time shrimp scampi, Little Forrest and I love it) and after that we play a game of ping pong. He's pretty good at it too, better than me even, I wish Jenny could see him. He's the best. Anna's prob'ably gonna come live with us if things don't improve. I mean, her neigh-boor was shot dead by those damn terrorists. I swear, this country's gettin' more corrupt even as I speak. First after nine-eleven, and now one of the best neigh-bor-hoods has gone sour. Yes, I guess it would be appropriate to run away from it all, but I'm an ol' man now and Little Forrest can't run well. I say he should try out for football, he refuses 'cuz Anna finds football peoples airheads. However, I don't think she knows what I did when I was in high school. I don't think that Little Forrest should go out for football, he can't run. That's why I can't run away from everything, because Little Forrest can't keep up.

He was in pain, but not as much pain as he'd be in if his body's shock wore off. He couldn't move his legs even an inch and his knees appeared to be so mutilated that you could barely even call them knees anymore. So this is the way he would go, huh? He always knew he was destined to die in the field just like every man in his family before him had. This is the moment he spent his entire life working up to. He knew what he had to do to finish this. To save whatever was left of his platoon (which he highly doubted there was anyone left alive) and to succumb to his destiny. He picked up the dead sergeants radio and ordered that the area be napalmed. As he made his radio call a man came running towards him and tripped over the corpse behind him. He paid no attention to the soldier. He didn't want to look at him after he had just ordered the destruction of the entire area. But that soldier refused to ignore his lieutenant. That soldier was Forrest Gump. \"He's dead!\" Forrest shouted to him as he shook his shoulder. \"Yeah, I know he's dead, my whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!\" He shouted back and angrily shook Forrest off of him. Forrest refused to take the hint and continued to lift him up. He started protesting vocally now; shouting at the soldier to leave him there, to go on without him and save himself. He couldn't be saved, he had a destiny to fulfill and besides, what kind of a life would await him if he did live? He was fully aware that he would never walk again. But Forrest didn't listen. He picked up his lieutenant and carried him to the safety of the riverbed before running back into the jungle to find his best friend and fellow soldier. As he ran back Lieutenant Dan looked away. That air strike would be arriving any minute. He looked around at the soldiers of his platoon all laying there with varying degrees of serious injuries. Men with third degree burns, men with multiple gunshot wounds, and men who would also be loosing limbs when arriving at the hospital. The Lieutenant let out a smoke flare. Soon someone would find them and they would all be returned home after being treated for their injuries. He cursed this day. He was wrenched from his destiny only to return home as a cripple. And all because of Forrest Gump. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I own nothing.

Because well, we all know what happens after that. This explains why she hates that home so much. This movie never fails to make me tear up, especially the ending. Even after how badly she treated Forrest. Jenny is not my favorite character, sorry to say. Partially inspired by Carrie Underwood's song 'Blown Away'. At age six, Jenny Curran didn't know exactly why their mother was gone. Her sister didn't know, either. Her father didn't really give her a crystal clear explanation. \"Get down here you filthy worthless-\" Her father spat out unfathomable words at them. Words Jenny had never heard before. Words that sounded mean and nasty. Her sister, Janet, looked at their father with large eyes. \"What's wrong, daddy?\" When the next thing Jenny saw was Janet being pinned up against the wall, she screamed. It must have been a rancid idea because she was on the ground in an instant with her own father towering over her. She tried her best to crawl away, to get back to her room, away from him. This wasn't normal, she thought. She wondered if Forrest's dad ever did stuff like this to him. \"Shut up you little rats!\" Jenny hadn't even realized that her sister was screaming too, tears visibly appearing on her face. She shut her eyes tightly and wished for it all to be over, not even aware that the worst hadn't began. \"Don't hurt Jenny!\" Janet yelled so loudly that her throat must have ached afterwards. She came barreling towards their father with both fists, trying her hardest to save them both. She stood no chance against the full-grown man and was taken down in a second. Watching her sister be abused was the hardest thing in Jenny's life to watch almost. Not to mention something she regretted for the rest of her short-lived life. Jenny wasn't even sure what their father was doing exactly. He took off Janet's clothes, though. She was confused. Janet fought against it the entire time until finally she gave up and just lie there. That was what scared the blonde the most. Later that night, Jenny and her sister slept in the same bed. For protection and comfort. \"Why does he do that to us, you think,\" Jenny whispered. \"Janet?\" Janet's face twisted. \"He says it's 'cause he loves us. But I don't think so's. Don't let him do that to you, Jenny. Try kickin' and screamin'.\" \"But don't that make him even madder?\" Jenny asked wide-eyed, trying to face her sister. Her sister's eyes darkened with each word. \"I think it hurts him when we do that.\" Jenny would have never thought of hurting her father. He took care of them, didn't he? They all three lived together as a family, right? It wasn't quite the same without their mother, but still. That's what they were. Why did he act like he hated them then? Had they done something wrong, she wondered. Fuzzy visions blurred through Jenny's mind as she thought too hard about the mottled situation and drifted off into sleep. \"Jenny!\" She was shaken awake by her sister, still clad in her pajamas. The blonde sat up tiredly and yawned. \"What?\" The first thing she noticed was that it was bright outside. Not like usual whenever they got up for a school day. It was much brighter outside. A loud, vicious bang on the door startled them both out of any drowsiness that was left in their systems. They huddled together as their father came in, looking furious. \"You stupid brats overslept!\" He took a step toward them. Janet took a deep breath before speaking. \"S-Sorry, the alarm must'a been-\" She was cut short. \"I don't give a damn! This is bullshit-\" He continued his rampage through the whole house, knocking things over and cursing. \"We can't stay here, Jenny,\" Janet whispered, clutching her closer. \"We gotta sneak out.\" Jenny didn't find the time to argue with her sister as they slipped out through the window, seemingly unnoticed. \"Where we goin', Janet?\" They ran through the large field, until they stopped under Jenny and Forrest's oak tree. \"I think we're safe,\" Janet panted, sitting down on the damp grass. Jenny took the place beside her. \"What about school?\" \"I guess it's our day off.\" Jenny stayed silent for a little while after that; she listened to the birds sing and the wind blow. It was a welcoming change compared to their chaotic house. Their father must not have been looking for them, because they stayed in that very spot for the remainder of the day. They chatted about pointless things until they started discussing why their father yells at them so much. \"Do you think we done somethin' wrong, Janet?\" Janet shook her head, eyes dark once more. \"I think he does it out of pure meanness, Jenny.\" Jenny pondered whether or not she should think the same way when they heard a call from their father. It echoed across the field. He sure was loud. \"We should go back,\" Jenny said, standing up and dusting herself off. Janet looked hesitant but she got up. \"Maybe he's calmer now.\" So, they walked, hand-in-hand, back to the dreaded household. Their dad was waiting on the porch, looking worse in temper. If that was possible. \"Where did you maggots go runnin' off to?!\" He demanded to know, clambering down the steps and starting toward them. She felt Janet back up, knowing that she was about to speak. \"We just thought you needed times to calm down,\" Janet explained shakily. Jenny could tell she was frightened. \"I was never mad,\" But his tone and actions begged to differ. He suddenly grabbed Janet in a swift movement, attempting to separate them. But they held on. \"Jenny!\" She tried to hold on but he was too strong. Jenny was tired of Janet always being hurt because of her; she felt like it was her fault. She could only watch as he dragged Janet inside, kicking and screaming along the way until out of earshot. Jenny was getting ready to go in after them when Forrest came around the corner, hollering and asking why she wasn't at school. She started worrying for Forrest's safety as she ordered him to run with her. They didn't run as far as she and Janet had, but they stopped at a safe distance. \"Pray with me, Forrest!\" Praying was something that she remembered her mama telling her to do. It was a foggy memory, but it's supposed to help whenever you or someone else is in danger. She got to her knees and said a quick prayer about her father, Forrest kneeling beside her. Jenny was scared. Scared for her and Janet's safety. Scared that he would do even worse things to them. Just plain scared.

It was Forrest Jr.'s birthday day fore' today. He's now about five years old. We were driving to a restaurant and he said, 'Mom, what are condoms?' Turns out he saw a big sign that said CONDOS . It was funny. He sometimes says things that don't sound the smartest. Mama always told me, Stupid is as Stupid Does. Forrest Jr. only says stupid things sometimes because he's a little boy. He's actually very smart. Smartest boy I know. That's all I have to say bout' that. We're doing something real excitin' today….going to Europe. Saw a commercial saying we should travel to Europe last year. Jenny always wanted to travel. So that's what we gon' do. The plane leaves in a couple hours. Signed , Forrest. Forrest Gump.\" Forrest's fingers touched the cracked leather and, once again, enclosed his thoughts. He slightly bent his knees and threw the journal like a Frisbee into an open suitcase. A soft thud was made when the brown cracked leather landed on a soft blue shirt in the suitcase. It was as if the clothes were there to cushion and absorb the precious journal. Forrest quickly skipped over to close the small suitcase. His fingers grasped the brown handle and out the door he went. Forrest Jr., and Jenny were staring anxiously in the hallway. \"DAD. Are you almost ready? We're waiting by the door. Daaaaadd,\" Forrest Jr. mumbled in a whiny voice. The moment Forrest walked out, their faces lite up and they all joyfully and excitedly trotted out the front door together. A huge slam of the door was followed by a quiet click of the lock being turned. Walking side by side they began their journey: Forrest with a simple, small brown suitcase, Jenny with a large floral suitcase, and Forrest Jr. with a small Pac-Man suitcase. . . . Forrest Jr.'s stomach felt as if they were moving up and down just as the turbulence of the plane was as it was descending. His face was pale and his little eyebrows were curled into an uneasy position. Jenny had her arms wrapped around him. \"It'll be okay baby. Look we're almost there. I know it's bumpy, but we'll be on the ground in no time,\" she was caressing and patting his head just as she had when he was a baby. \"Look! We're landing. Close your eyes and take three deep breaths. Then we'll be on the ground.\" Just as the wheels touched the ground, Forrest Jr. could breathe again. His anxiety and nausea was instantly released from his body once he deeply exhaled a sigh of relief. Walking through airport side by side, with suitcases in hand, Forrest Jr. was constantly turning his head out of curiosity just like he had in New York City. This time, Jenny and Forrest were doing it too. All signs were in German. They whizzed by others walking and heard the language spoken in a strong and foreign tongue. This was the first time their ears and eyes had been exposed to German, and it was obvious to the common passerby. \"Mommy. What are they saying?\" Forrest Jr. whispered with great concern and wide eyes. \"They speak a different language than us, honey. It's called German. We're in Germany. They communicate just like we do, but they do it in a different way. Isn't it wonderful?\" Jenny crouched down and whispered in his ear in a singy song voice. \"German, huh? WOW. I want to talk like them.\" Forrest Jr. exclaimed as if he was full of sunshine and was releasing all of it with excitement and joy. His eyes twinkled and he was consumed with happiness and joy. Their adventure began in Berlin. Hotel rates were extremely inexpensive because of the riots and issues between the government and the people of East and West Berlin. It was not a hotspot on the tourism list at the time. Forrest was unaware of what was going on in Berlin and he booked the cheapest room he could find in all of Europe. That was in Berlin. The disposition of Forrest Jr., Jenny, and Forrest while strolling down the streets of Berlin was no different than hours earlier in the airport. They could see the culture, hear the culture, and even smell it. \"Look Jenny. Look at all this art. All around. Just look at it,\" Forrest said slowly. His eyes were wide and he walked uneasily as if he were overwhelmed; taking so much in. Berlin was covered in artwork, as if every resident grabbed a paint brush and made the city their canvas. The city appeared to be covered in grimy graffiti displaying the rough and rugged state of Berlin at the time. The Gump family spotted one particular cement wall that was covered in the grimiest graffiti, displaying strong emotions. \"Jenny, will you take a picture of me in front of this art wall right here?\" Forrest asked kindly. \"Of course! Go stand in front of it Forrest.\" Forrest stood with his arms straight down to the side; he was used to doing that due to his time in the war. He didn't smile, but he looked pleasant like he was in good spirits. Jenny's mouth was smiling, the camera right in front of her eyes. The suspense of waiting for her to focus the camera correctly and then click the button was intense; she was not very good. Just as Jenny's finger had been pushed down halfway, a huge BOOM was heard. The top right corner of that particular slab of the wall was hit by a giant machine. The basketball sized concrete chunk began to fall as if it was all in slow motion. Jenny's eyes widened just as Forrest Jr.'s did. Jenny yelled, \"Run Forrest Run!\" but just as he had heard, BAM ! The concrete slab thudded harshly right on his head. The camera clicked instantaneously. \"Oh my god. Forrest!\" Jenny screamed as Forrest and Jenny sprinted to him. He was lying on the ground. Jenny tried to move his limbs, he was not awake. Others on the scene rushed over. A nice Berlin woman call the Berlin ambulance. Soon enough, Jenny, unconscious Forrest, and Forrest Jr. were flashing red and blue lights, driving away. . . . \"It's the exact year of 1989. We went to Berlin a month ago. I was hit in the head by some type of wall they like to call The Berlin Wall. Apparently it was separating East and West Berlin. Separating lots of families. They were knocking it down. Getting rid o' it. I had a concussion for almost two weeks. Doctors said it hit a soft part of my head. I'm awake now and I feel good. I wasn't expecting that. You know mama always said, Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you gonna get. Turns out, since I was won the Medal of Honor for the Vietnam War and all, President Bush invited us to the Vietnam Memorial to meet him. It was a big deal that I was hit in the head with this concrete slab, since I was a U.S. soldier who won a Medal of Honor. It was in the newspapers and everything. I think that's how the President of the United States found out maybe. We need to leave now. Signed, Forrest. Forrest Gump.\" At the Vietnam Memorial in Washington D.C., Forrest, Jenny, and Forrest Jr. all dressed up. Forrest was in uniform, since he was meeting President Bush. Forrest Jr. loved the memorial because he could see himself in the black, shiny, reflection of the wall with all the names on it. A man in a black suit escorted the Gump family to a side building by the memorial. Standing in the first door was President Bush. Forrest went up to him, shook his hand, and said, \"Thanks for having us President Bush.\" Jenny smiled and hugged the president. \"I'm so sorry to hear about your accident in Berlin. We wanted you and your family to come in and make a couple of statements about the accident, since you did win the Medal of Honor, people know you and would like to hear.\" President Bush said professionally with a constant smile. \"Let's start with you Forrest Jr. How did you feel when your daddy was hit by the wall? Were you scared?\" Forrest Jr. looked at him like he would any man on the street and said, \"Uhh….I gotta' pee.\" Laughter in the room broke out. Stupid is as Stupid Does.

Empty bottles lay strewn around his apartment. He searched the kitchen, the living room, and now he was searching his bedroom. Only the empty bottles greeted him. He wasn't looking for empty bottles though, he was looking for a full bottle. Or at least a half-empty one. \"Dammit!\" he yelled as he threw the empty bottle against the wall. He went back into the living room and double checked the drawers. Still no luck. After slamming shut of the end table drawers he glanced at the clock. 10 o'clock. The liquor store was closed for the night and the bar was closed for the night due to a private party. \"Well that's just great!\" he put himself in front of the TV. \"Happy Thanksgiving to me.\" he added bitterly. He sighed and slumped down in his wheelchair. When he heard a light knock on the door he angrily called, \"What?\" \"Are you okay?\" came the voice of his neighbor. She had helped him a few times before and he now felt bad about yelling at her. He just hadn't expected it to be her. \"Dan?\" she asked when he didn't answer. \"You can come in.\" he said as he sat up. \"Are you okay? I heard a lot of banging and it sounded like glass breaking. I thought you might be hurt or something…\" she trailed off. \"Nah, just lookin' for some booze.\" he said. \"Did you find any?\" she asked. \"Of course not.\" he said with a hint of anger in his voice. \"Well…I'm not a big drinker, but I have some wine, if you would like to come over I'd be glad to share some.\" she said. \"No, I don't want to interrupt your Thanksgiving dinner any more than I probably already have.\" he said. \"I'm not having one, but if you're hungry I could make a little something real quick.\" she said. \"I couldn't…\" he said. \"No, I insist. I mean, what's Thanksgiving without a dinner?\" she insisted. \"Well…alright.\" he agreed. He went over to her apartment and the two of them had a small dinner. It may not have been a huge turkey with the boat load of extra food, but it was a dinner nonetheless. \"You know, Dan, \" she said after taking another sip of her wine, \"I really like you.\" Dan looked up from his plate and stared at her in disbelief. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. \"Me?!\" \"Yeah.\" she blushed. He smiled, \"Good. Because I really like you too.\" She smiled back and then for once Dan was happier than he had been in a long time. Next thing he knew he was slumped in his wheelchair in front of his TV. He looked around and took a minute to figure out where he was. He glanced at the clock; Midnight. He then became depressed when he realized that it was only a dream. There was never any knock on his door, or any dinner with the girl next door. It was just him, alone in his living room and surrounded by empty bottles. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: I don't own Lt. Dan. (Although I do love him lots.) I only own the OC.

Jenny always thought that he acquired it through somewhat unorthodox methods; perhaps he had scammed a well-to-do individual and ran off with the money to buy his own place. Maybe an elderly man used to live here, tucked away into the Alabama countryside – that was until her father probably drove him away and selfishly claimed this land as his own. He seemed like the type of person who would commit such outrageous acts. If he could drive Jenny's grandmother to live in a rickety old trailer with little to no financial assistance, he was capable of doing anything. But maybe his immoralities were the result of his own frustrations that he tried to drown out through drinking. He had always said that one of the reasons for his frustrations was because her mother had been a disappointment in childbearing; no man had use for daughters if they were to be married off to strangers. Sometimes Jenny thought that if she and her sisters had even one brother, their situation might have been better. Her father might have been endearing, and perhaps he wouldn't have killed their mother in the first place, leaving them in a corrupt household overrun with little girls and an aggravated drunk who was only capable of destroying those close to him like empty wine bottles which were often strewn across the house. It was always nice to imagine, for Jenny had always been somewhat disconnected from the world, having spent too many days of her childhood hiding in the cornfields drowning out terrifying drunken voices calling her name, by humming hymns under her breath as her body rocked back and forth in prayer. When she was not praying, she masked the world in a façade of lies that her imagination unraveled. She tore husks from the overripe corn that her father had not yet harvested, and threaded them into dolls – something she had taught herself to do. Mixing saliva with the grime of her skin, she used this as an ink to draw in the eyes and the mouths. Soon, she would have a whole family of husk dolls with a small village of houses made from freshly turned earth. Sometimes they were made out of rocks; but there were never enough rocks, so she sufficed with the sand of the dirt, packing them together with water so that they would not fall. She would guide the family of dolls, two in each hand, through the makeshift roads she drew with her finger that ran down the sand houses. Sometimes she pretended they were shopping for new ribbons and dresses, and other times, they went to the house and she dreamed of food set before her on the table when there was never any. She whispered to these husk dolls, her voice never rising more than a whisper in case her father found her. In her mind, they always responded, in sympathetic, loving tones of warmth that had been notably absent in her youth. \"Jenny, you've been so strong, my darling,\" the ghost of her mother's voice drifted into her thoughts as she slept in the cornfield for the night, stomach groaning for food. \"My goodness, you are getting so much older and taller too. Have you had enough to eat? How about Mommy makes you a stack of waffles in the morning when you make up?\" \"I love you Jenny, my dear.\" Jenny would bring the husk doll representing her nonexistent mother to her cheek, where sometimes she felt the slightest touch of a hand upon her cheek, parting past tangles of blond hair to comfort her as she slept in fitful spasms of fear and worriment for the future. When she grew older, she abandoned these dolls – childish games of her youth in favor of rocks. She collected them from the dirt path she walked down to her bus stop, and pocketed them. Her favorite one was a pretty copper color, almost like it was rusting away slowly in the inside exposing rich mineral hues. She never told anyone of this strange hobby of hers, not even Forrest. For her, rocks were a reminder of the lingering past that stood like stone monuments in her conscience. She was a child back then, but the memories of her father's abuse refused to erode and dissipate. That is why every day was a conflict that rose up deep within her, but unseen by others. If Jenny were to enter the battlefield her mind was separated into: one side filled with stone reminders of her corrupted childhood, and another side filled with the good things that had happened which accumulated since she had first met Forrest, she would force herself to bravely stride into the fray with her rocks and slowly chip away at the stone monuments that haunted the graveyard of her sins. It was a lengthy process, but Jenny believed that even stone could be worn away with effort. Water was not as hard as stone, but it had the power to tear away the cliffs of shorelines, and break down barriers. Stones of harder minerals such as diamonds had the ability to break apart weaker stones and turn them to dust. So Jenny thought that likewise, if she kept chipping away at the memories that weighed her down, someday, they would become nonexistent.

Forrest Gump had just lost his wife to some virus three months ago, and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't think about her. Ever since the first time he met Jenny Curran, she was always on his mind. He really and truly loved her, and he always would until his dying day. At first, when he proposed to her, she had said no, saying that he wouldn't want to be married to her, but that wasn't true. Forrest had wanted that more than anything. To marry her, and to start a family. It broke his heart that she hadn't loved him back. He tried everything in his power to make her happy, and to treat her right. He wrote her letters, bought her candy, did everything for her, even defended her when some guys were being rough with her, much to her annoyance. Forrest knew that he wasn't the brightest bulb in the tanning bed, but he did know what love was, and knew that he was in love with Jenny. She had been his best friend when they were kids, and as they got older, he fell in love with her. That night when Jenny had come into his room, telling him that she did love him, he had been so happy. They made love, and fell asleep right next to each other. The next day when he woke up, Jenny was gone. No note, nothing. Well, she did leave the Metal of Honor he gave her. Why, he didn't know. Hopefully she just forgot it, and didn't leave it behind deliberately. Jenny had confused him so much. One minute she's telling him she loves him, then the next, she takes off without an explanation. When they had gotten married, Forrest was even happier than he had ever been in his life. She was the one to contact him, and then surprised him by telling him they had a son together, and then she told him she was sick, and then asked him to marry her. He hadn't known that Jenny's illness was that serious, and thought it would go away in a few days. They had been married six months and her condition had gotten worse. There were good days and bad days. The doctors couldn't do anything for her. That day when he had come in to wake her up, he had found her on the floor by the side of the bed, dead. He broke down the second he saw her. Little Forrest was still asleep, luckily. He didn't want him to see his mama's body. It was the hardest thing he ever had to do, and he had fought in a war. Telling his son that his mama had went to heaven made him break down even harder. Surprisingly, Little Forrest had to calm his daddy down more than his daddy had to calm him down. Little Forrest was hurting badly, but he knew how sensitive his daddy was, and knew that he needed to be strong for him. While Little Forrest was at school, Forrest went into his and Jenny's bedroom to clean up some things. Lately, he had been sleeping on the couch, but now finally mustered up the courage to come back in here. As he was cleaning the closet, he pulled down some books that had belonged to Jenny- Moby Dick, Pride & Prejudice, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, etc. He then saw a book that said DIARY on it. Forgetting about the other books, Forrest sat down on the side of the bed and started to flip through the pages. He was shocked to find out that what Jenny wrote was mostly about him! Dear Diary, Tonight while I was singing on stage, a bunch of drunks started to mess with me while I was performing. I was expecting the manager to come and kick them out, but what I got was Forrest Gump knocking them all down and then trying to carry me off stage. It was embarrassing, I will admit. I know I yelled at Forrest, but deep down, I was grateful that he was there to help me. Tonight was a very bad night, and it got even worse when he told me that he would be fighting in Vietnam. I told him to not be brave or anything if he got in trouble, to just run away. Hopefully, he will. That was the end of that page, and then Forrest flipped to another page. Dear Diary, I hurt Forrest again. I told him that he didn't want to marry me, after he proposed. I then went into his room to tell him that I loved him, but then I took off the next morning before he woke up. I wasn't lying. I do love Forrest, but deep down, I know that he deserves better than me. I left the Metal of Honor he gave me, because it would always remind me of him, and I thought it best that we go our separate ways for good. It was never my intention to hurt him, but I had to let him know that I did love him before I took off. I had to show him. We made love. That was when I became pregnant. I didn't know if I should contact Forrest or not. I wanted my child to know his father, I really did, but I didn't know how Forrest would take it. Or if he would even talk to me. I decided to name my child after his daddy. If it had been a girl, I would have named her Sally, after my mama. Maybe one day, I will tell Forrest. Forrest quickly flipped to the next page. Dear Diary, Me and Forrest have married. I'm sick. I went to a bunch of doctors and they don't know what's wrong and they can't help. I didn't know if I was going to die or not, and I wanted my child to finally meet his father, and I knew should something happen to me, Forrest would take care of him. I sent Forrest a letter, asking him to come see me, and gave him my address and apartment number. I couldn't tell him he had a son in a letter, or how sorry I was for the way I treated him in a letter. Luckily, he showed up, and I was never so happy to see anybody in all of my life. He brought me a box of chocolates like he always does. He is so sweet. At first, he had been in shock when he find out he was a father, but then he relaxed, and we took Little Forrest to the park and that's when I told him that I was sick, and asked him to marry me. He said yes. I was so relieved. I wanted us to be a family. I wanted to make it up to Forrest for the way I treated him over the years. After the wedding, we moved into his house. I'm sicker. I know that might time is coming, and I'm leaving behind the diary for Forrest, so that he knows that he meant a lot to me and how sorry I am for everything, and I should have told him about Little Forrest sooner. I will always be grateful to him, and Forrest, if you're reading this, I love you, and I'll miss you. Tell Little Forrest I love him, and make sure you look out for him. That was it. That was all she wrote. Forrest had tears pouring down his cheeks now. Oh, how he missed her. Reading her diary just made him miss her even more. But at least she was in a better place, with Mama and Bubba. At least Forrest wasn't alone. He still had his son, and Lieutenant Dan, who had been very consoling to him after Jenny's funeral, and he and his fiancee' Susan had offered to stay with them for a while, but Forrest had assured them they would be okay, and Dan told him to call if they needed him. Forrest kissed the diary and placed it on Jenny's pillow on the bed. \"I love you, Jenny.\" THE END ","Summary":" It had been very emotional the past few months.

IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIO \"CommandernJones, there is an unidentified fighter ship on the boarders, askingnfor permission to enter,\" said a young man who was sitting in frontnof a variety of monitors with headphones looped over his head. Thisnwas only a small section of a command centre on the planets surface.nCommander Jones, who was a white haired middle aged man, got up fromnhis chair and stood over the young man. \"Well?nWhat are you waiting for?\" he asked gruffly, \"try to find out whonit is\". The young man nodded his head and flicked a switch on anboard in front of him. \"This isnground control, please state your name and business,\" he said intonhis mouth piece. \"This isnship, register 10826, to ground control.

The young controller flicked another switch andnturned to the Commander. \"Isn'tnRakat Dell a bounty hunter?\" he asked. Commander Jones nodded. \"Yes,nshe it. She's probably here to collect a bounty and cause trouble.nGet her back on and deny entrance\". The young man fiddled withnswitches, yet again. \"Younhave been denied entrance,\" he announced. An angry voice replied tonhim. \"Listen,nif you don't let me though this ship will most likely fall apart.nI'll make sure to set a course to your command centre\". The youngnman looked towards the Commander. Commander Jones nodded his head. \"Younhave access to pass. Welcome to Fhloston Paradise,\" the young mannsaid into his mouth piece. \"Aboutntime,\" Rakat Dell growled. She got her small fighter ship into gearnas the lights on the space boarder flicked green. She sped her wayntowards the blue planet. A high pitched buzzing was emitting from onenof the engines in the ship. Rakat lent over her steering control,ntapped her foot impatiently as the buzzing got louder. Landing wasngoing to be a close call. RakatnDell was an infamous bounty hunter. Although, she thought that famenmade her easier to find. She had short dark brown hair; with a fringenthat was long enough to frequently go into her eyes. Her eyes werenlarge and dull grey, rimmed with long dark lashes. On the right sidenof her face was a long scar. It started at her eyebrow and ended atnher ear. Her usual clothing was a pair of brown pants, tucked intonknee high black work boots. Around her waist was a belt equip withntwo pistols, a knife and various mechanical gear. She always wore andirty singlet that was stained with ship grease and who know whatevernelse. Her arms were bare and scarred. Along her left arm were variousnprison identification numbers. The image was complete with hernpermanent scowl on her mouth. Her shipnwas a small fighter, equip with guns and ammo. It had two sleepntubes, only one which worked. The rest of the ship was messy andnlooked as though it would fall apart. She made all the repairsnherself, not trusting other people. It was a slight problem in thenengine that was making her land at Fhloston Paradise now. Rakat wasnchecking the engine panel what a bright flash drew her eyes to thenwindow. She frowned, not worrying until she noticed it want annexplosion of a large ship. \"Shit!nThe shields\" she said, diving for the switch. Not in time. Piecesnof space junk plummeted into her ship. It tore away the navigationnrudder on the back of the ship along with a less important part ofnthe ship. Rakat strapped herself into her chair as her small shipnstarted to fall towards Fhloston Paradise. She struggles to keepncontrol of the steering, as the ship grew hotter as it dropped fromnthe sky. There were small machine bots she could send out, but shenknew in a few seconds the ship would hit the ground. She took a deepnbreath as she pressed a blinking red button. All the energy left innthe ship was set to the ships shields. The shield glowed red as thenship kept falling towards an unknown region of Fhloston Paradise. Asnthe ground rose up the meet her, Rakat pulled down the metalnprotectors on the window. No one saw as the ship crashed into thenearth, skidding a few meters to be half buried in a snow dune. Thendust settled.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I do not own any part of the Fifth Element. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Zorg had been sitting in the snow for a few minutes now. He was cold, but at least he could think about that instead of how screwed he was. There was no way he could get anywhere, and the gun on his lap had no ammo, the other functions also not working. He thought he could climb down the icy hill that he was on. Seeing as there was no point, he continued to sit until some idea popped into his head. Through the swirling snowflakes, there was a bright flash. Zorg jerked his head to see something fall from the sky. Over in the distance it crashed, but he couldn't see what had happened to it. He rose to his feet and slung the gun over his shoulder. Dusting snow off himself, he started to carefully climb down from where he was. He might as well see what it was; the alternative was freezing to death. He trekked over dunes of snow. His artificial leg making it difficult as it kept sinking into the deep snow. Finally, when he thought he could go no further, he saw what it was. It was a crash of a small fighter ship. The type of fighter that was fast and had quite a bit of space inside. His own company made ones like this. Although, this one wasn't one of his, or atleast he didn't think so. The ship was modified a lot. He was getting closer by the second, until he finally stood a meter away from the craft. The ship providing shelter from the snow that blew at him when he was walking. He looked over the ship and noticed the crash hadn't damaged it too bad. There wasn't anything that couldn't be fixed. The more he looked over it, the more he could see how it had been modified. Parts of the ship didn't belong to the model. Obviously only to fill in until proper materials could be brought, or stolen. He came to where the identification numbers were, instead the original was scratched out and a new one painted over. A sign below it declared the ships name as 'The Junk'. Zorg frowned; he's heard that name before. Suddenly, sound from within the ship told of movement. He flattened himself against the ship, behind the wing so he wouldn't be seen but he'd be able to see whoever opened the door and stepped out. Rakat opened her eyes slowly. She realised she had blacked out on impact. That was a rare occurrence, but when she moved to unbuckle her belt she realised why she had blacked out. The pain in her head was terrible; it must have smashed against the headrest. It was too dark to see anything, all the ships energy had gone. She felt her head and found it was sticky with blood, there was also a large bump. Feeling around, she unbuckled her belt and got up. Over her head, she flicked a switch and a dull red glow filled the ship. With the emergency lights on, she made her way towards her locker. The emergency lights needed no ship power, seeing as they were powered by a crystal in the ship. It let out a red light, and would work in any situation. The floor was messier that it usually was. All the items that had not been strapped down had flown to the ground when the ship crashed. When she had got to her locker, she opened its door to look in the small mirror on the door. She found there was a cut on her forehead. It wasn't too bad, but it oozed a lot of blood. She wiped at it with a cloth from her locker. Grabbing a plaster, she stuck it over the cut. Other than the cut and bump, she was okay. Next, she surveyed the damage to the ship. Seeing as the ship only had 3 rooms, the search was over quickly. There was very minimal damage to the inside, only messy. The last thing she had to do was check the damage on the outside. The monitor next to the door was barely working. It told her the statistics from outside the ship. The air was breathable and the ship had crashed on a solid surface. The shields were now down and the ship was venerable to anything. Jabbing at the monitor, she made the small door slide open. Freezing cold wind and snow blurred her vision for a second. She fought the urge to shiver as she stepped onto the snow outside. It was much colder compared to the inside of the ship. Shielding her eyes from the snow, she moved out a few steps and turned around to survey the damage. Zorg saw who it was. The fairly young woman pushed her short hair from her face as she looked at the ship. He noticed the prison tattoos along her left are, then he realised who it was. Rakat Dell, one of the best bounty hunters. But what was she doing at Fhloston? Was she here to collect a bounty on him? Paranoid thoughts filled his head. Then he cocked his gun. It wasn't loaded, of course, but she wouldn't know that, seeing as it was the newest gun there was. Zorg stepped out from his place. Rakat was shocked to see him pop out, although it didn't show on her face. She noticed his gun, and realised she wouldn't be able to reach her pistol in time. \"Rakat Dell,\" he drawled in his southern American accent. He walked towards her, \"you don't know me, but I'll be taking this ship of yours\". Rakat took a good look at the man in front of her. He looked like a business man, wearing fashionable clothing with a unique haircut. His face was hansom, but it had a cruel twist to it. As he took another step she could see and hear the 'chink' sound of an artificial leg. She had heard of one person that fit his description. \"Zorg,\" she spat. Zorg's eyes widened as he heard her speak his name. \"So, you do know who I am. That doesn't stop the fact that I'll be taking your ship,\" he told her, raising his gun higher. Rakat smiled slyly \"It's too bad you're out of ammo, Zorg,\" she said. As quick as a flash, she flipped out one of her pistols from her belt and aimed it at him. Zorg grasped his gun for a few moments, before throwing it to the side. \"How did you know? My guns are the newest around?\" he asked. \"I know about every gun on the market, Zorg,\" she told him, making him turn so she could slip handcuffs over his hands. She lent over his shoulder to talk in his ear, \"Every gun off and on the market\". Rakat pushed him towards the entrance to the ship. Once inside, she shoved him down onto a waiting chair. He instantly tried to adjust his eyes to the red emergency lighting. \"Don't move a muscle,\" she told him, \"or I will kill you\". Zorg looked up at her with a cool indifference. \"I wasn't planning to move,\" he drawled. Rakat glared at him and opened a cupboard to pull out a warm coat and tool box. Zorg watched her as she shrugged on the coat and slung the box's strap over her shoulder. As she reached the door exit, she turned her head. \"Remember what I said, Zorg. You move, you die,\" she left before she could see the face Zorg pulled at her. Childish, yes. But he didn't have any other way to piss her off. He looked around the inside of the ship. The whole of the ship was tiny. The small room he was in now contained two chairs (one which he was sitting in) with a table in the middle. Along the other wall was a whole variety of cupboards, most likely for the food capsules and extra equipment. He guessed there was more storage below the ship. He thought all the storage would be needed, seeing as Rakat was a bounty hunter. Bounty hunters had a habit for keeping things that could be useful, seeing as their life was lived on the run. Zorg lent over to see into the next room, which connected to the one he was in. From what he could see, it contained two bunks that were fit into the wall. Across from the bunks were two sleep tubes, one of which had the glass broken. There were a few lockers inside. Rakat Dell's clothing and equipment, Zorg guessed. Back the other way, past the entrance door, was the control area. There were two seats in front of millions of blinking buttons and switches. They took up all the space around that area. The large windows in front of the chairs were blocked with its metal protectors. Suddenly, the red emergency lights turned off and the normal lights blinked on. He heard the unmistakeable sound of Rakat hammering at the ship. Also, the buzzing of the ships repair bots. Zorg chose now to move. He got up, attempting to balance with his hands cuffed at the back. He walked to the back of the ship, looking to find some sort of weapon that he could hide up his sleeve. There was no used trying to get the cuffs off, there were top grade. Rakat Dell was outside. She was repairing the damage, and had almost done. Although, she couldn't replace the navigation rudder. But, she could replace that when she got to a Fhloston Paradise ship market. Packing her tools away, she sent the small ship bots back to their stations. The wind was picking up as she headed back into the ship. She made sure the door was sealed tight and turned around to make a comment to Zorg. He wasn't where she had left him. Rakat's neck hairs bristled and she pulled her pistol out. Heading towards the back of the ship, she found him. He had his back to her, searching franticly for something. Well, as frantically as a person with their hands cuffed can do. Raising her gun she loaded it with a loud 'click'. Zorg stiffened and slowly turned around. \"What did I tell you Zorg,\" she asked, before pulling the trigger. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Reviews welcome.[Chapter 3] The bullet nested in the steel next to Zorg's head. The loud bang making him jump, and when he saw he wasn't hurt he quickly spun around. Rakat now held the gun pointing straight at Zorg. Fury showed on her face. \"Sit,\" she commanded, pointing to the chair just behind her. When Zorg sat down she twined his handcuffs to the chair, so he couldn't get up. Realising the situation finally, Zorg tired to reason with Rakat. \"Listen, I'll give you whatever you want if you let me go. Just don't kill me,\" he drawled. Rakat laughed as she sat behind the controls of the ship. \"I'm not going to kill you, Zorg,\" she informed him, \"I know there would be a huge bounty on my head if I did that. I'd rather just leave you in Fhloston somewhere. I don't need your money\". This came as a shock to Zorg and he sat quiet for a while as he watched Rakat. He realised that Rakat didn't know that he was missing to the rest of the world, and he was going to take advantage of this situation. To be back safe and sound when this bounty hunter could just turn around and dump him back in the snow. After watching Rakat punching at controls and looking at the virtual screen, he spoke; \"So, where are you going to drop me off?\" \"I'm figuring that out now,\" Rakat snapped. Rakat's fingers flew over the controls and tapped on them. A large hologram rose from the screen in front of her. It was a 3D image of Fhloston Paradise. \"My navigation rudder is gone,\" Rakat explained, \"so I have to guess where we are\". She scanned over the ice regions and poked at a button. A red beacon appeared on the hologram. \"This is where I think we are, and the closest town is here,\" a blue beacon shot up not too far from the red one. \"That's the city of Rosebeach, one of the largest in Fhloston. Be thankful I landed where I did\". \"So, are we leaving now?\" asked Zorg. Rakat swivelled on her chair to look at him. \"Incase you haven't been listening, there's a storm outside\". Zorg now listened and he heard a wailing sound as wind and snow buffed the small ship. \"Is there any chance that you'll let me out of these handcuffs?\" Zorg asked as Rakat turned back to the switches. \"No, not after you threatened to kill me and steal my ship,\" she said curtly. \"Why not? I can't do any damage to you now, you're going to take me to Rosebeach and I have no grudge with you\". Rakat was silent and Zorg saw her eyebrows crease. \"Fine,\" she answered shortly, \"but, Zorg, if you disobey my orders I will kill you\". \"I promise you, Rakat Dell, that I won't misbehave,\" Zorg said, staring into Rakat's eyes to prove his point. Rakat sighed and got out of her chair. She stood behind Zorg and released him from his handcuffs. Once free, he rubbed the red marks on let out a sigh. Rakat went back to her controls and flicked a switch to put the panel on hold. Zorg realised how small the ship was as he stood up to stretch. Rakat had to squeeze past him to reach a cupboard where she pulled out food pills. \"Choose what you want,\" she said, throwing him the container. Zorg read over the label that listed all the meals available. \"What are you going to have,\" he asked Rakat. She shrugged and walked to the back of the ship. \"Whatever you're having\". Zorg read over the label again. There were normal things like steak and vegetables and more alien things like Garudo Squid. Zorg finally opened the container and chose two pills. He then located the microwave. Rakat had placed herself in a chair at the table with a notebook to record down some manual reports of the ship. When Zorg placed a plate of food in front of her she drew back her lip. \"Spaghetti?\" she asked, looking at the mass of noodles in sauce. \"Either that or the squid,\" said Zorg, shrugging. They ate with disposable forks. Halfway through the meal, Zorg drawled out a question; \"So, how did you crash?\" he asked. \"Why should I tell you? Maybe I'm just a bad driver,\" Rakat answered, eyes on her food. Zorg snorted softly; \"I wouldn't beilive that\". \"Fine, it was the aftermath of a space explosion. It hit my ship,\" said Rakat. Zorg sat wide eyed. \"What now?\" Rakat sighed. \"That was on of the hotels from Fhloston. I was on that,\" Zorg said. Rakat raised an eyebrow. \"But how?\" \"Why should I tell you?\" Zorg smirked. When he saw Rakat's frown he dropped his smirk and explained how his gun had a cocoon shield function. \"You're lucky,\" said Rakat, when Zorg had finished, \"plenty of people wouldn't know what to do in a situation like that\". \"What about you?\" asked Zorg. Rakat shrugged. \"Figure that out yourself\". She stood from the table and disposed of her food into a bin on the wall. \"I'm going to take a shower,\" Rakat said, moving a few steps to the back of the ship. Zorg got up too. \"May I ask something?\" \"Go ahead\" \"If you don't trust me, why are you leaving me unsupervised?\" Zorg asked. \"Well, I haven't had a shower in a week or so. I was very busy with my last bounty. So, you can see this is the perfect opportunity for me to stop smelling like a space cow. Also, if you did try anything, it would take a lot more that you to stop me\". Rakat poked a switch on the wall and an unseen door slid open to reveal a shower. \"Don't touch anything,\" she warned as the shower door slid shut behind her. When Zorg heard the water start up, he took a few steps to reach the controls of the ship. He ran the survey screen that showed him what was wrong with the ship. Rakat had fixed everything apart from the bits that had gone missing. Suddenly, Zorg spied the phone. He quickly dialled a number and pressed it to his ear. Nothing, no dial tone. He placed the phone down and he started to fiddle with the controls. He didn't hear the water stop and the door open. \"What are you doing?\" demanded Rakat's voice. Zorg swivelled around. His heart quickened half from being caught and half from how Rakat looked. Fresh from the shower, her hair was wet and it clung to her head. The same way the towel was slinging to her body. The visible parts of her body were pink from the shower. \"What are you doing?\" she asked again. Zorg swallowed, \"I'm… ah… trying to call someone\". To his surprise, Rakat didn't get angry. \"You won't get it working,\" she said, before she turned around and went to the back of the ship. Zorg wiped his brow. He hadn't noticed that Rakat Dell was a pretty woman. No one knew that, he thought to himself. Rakat appeared dressed a minute later. She sat back at the table where her notebook was; she opened it and started writing. \"Why won't anything work?\" asked Zorg. Rakat didn't look up from the book. \"I do what all good bounty hunters do. I rewire all the controls to do another task. The evacuation button, for instance, is the self destruct button\". Rakat closed her book and walked to the back of the ship, Zorg following her. She pulled the sheets back from one of the two beds in the wall. \"So, I wouldn't be able to take this ship even if I wanted to?\" Zorg asked. Rakat smiled and climbed into the bed. \"Nope,\" she replied. Zorg frowned. \"Are you going to bed soon, Zorg?\" Rakat asked, \"I have to get up early tomorrow and I can't leave the light on all night\". Zorg nodded and sat on a metal chest to unlace his shoes. He climbed into the bed above Rakat's. Rakat reached on the wall, the lights switched out and were replaced with a dull glow. The next day was certainly going to be eventful, Zorg thought to himself. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Sorry about the whole \"Zorg-realises-Rakat-is-hot\" thing. I just needed to make him take an interest in her somehow. Meh, I think I have an okay storyline in my head. About how 'Mr. Shadow' wants his revenge, even though he's trapped as the huge evil ball thing. Whoo, then Zorg'll have to hire Rakat as a body guard… not sure how the love interest thing will turn out.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the rights to the Fifth Element. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Thomas Merridew sighed heavily and splashed cold water onto his face. He looked in the mirror in front of the sink. A tired man of 34 stared back at him. His hair was red and starting to bald at the back. His face was pale and looked older than it should. He stood at medium height and was rather thin and scrawny. Thomas fingered the tie around his neck and sighed again. Back to work, back to boredom. He exited the office bathroom, feeling worse than ever. He walked back, amongst the multiple computer terminals and their occupants. Other office people that looked much more healthy and happy than he did. Thomas ignored them as he plodded on. He worked in a sub company of the Zorg Corporation. They did mostly long legal paperwork reports that no one else wanted to do. Same thing day in and day out. Being in the job ever since leaving school at 16, Thomas felt trapped. He used to feel happy with his job, when he had a happy family waiting at home for him. Now he didn't. Thomas reached his own computer and sat heavily in the seat. None of the people around him looked up. Thomas glanced around him and felt stifled. The grey walls, the lack of light, the crowded computers. It seemed everything was from centuries ago, and the company constantly overlooked this department when redecorating. Watching the constant flow of things, Thomas felt he would rather die. Then an idea sparked in his head. Why not die? For months he had been living like this, in depression. Why shouldn't he just end it all? The more Thomas thought about it, the more it seemed and option. Getting up from his terminal again, Thomas packed up his briefcase. He then made his way to the elevator and pressed the top button. When he got out at the top he was greeted with a stunning view of New York City. The building he was on was very high, but was still dwarfed by other buildings around which had their tops in the clouds. Thomas was buffed with cold winds as he made his way towards the edge. He climbed over the safety barrier and hung onto the side. He was now standing on the outer rim of the skyscraper. The edge only giving him enough room for half his feet, his toes poked over the side. He carefully leaned forwards and the wind took his breath away. So far down was the building that it grew very distant before reaching the smog on the ground. He saw tiny dots moving around, which were cars and such. Up where he was there wasn't nobody enjoying the view because it was too cold and the air too thin. He gripped, white knuckled, onto the barrier. He lifted one foot over the empty space, to see how it would feel. The wind took his led and pulled. Thomas quickly placed his foot back on the edge and wiped the cold swear on is brow. Now or never. He leaned dangerously over the edge, the wind picked up. He was going to let go… When his phone rung. Once he had gotten over his surprise he fumbled in his pocket and pressed his mobile to his ear. He was greeted with a raspy deep voice, which made him shudder. \"Thomas Merridew\" This was not a question, but a statement that whoever was on the other side of the phone knew who he was. Thomas plucked up some courage even though he was shaking. \"Who is this? How do you know my name?\" The voice came out of his phone was the same tone. \"I can see you, I am everywhere\" Thomas's eyes darted around and a new sheet of sweat was on his brow. \"I have an important job for you\" the voice continued. \"What?\" stammered Thomas. The one word the voice said made Thomas cold to his bone. \"Revenge\" IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Rakat Dell drowned the dregs of the glass and put it back on the bar. The auto-tender rolled over. \"You want some more?\" it asked in an automated voice. Rakat nodded, and liquid was sprayed into her glass. The bar around her was loud with music and voices. It was damp and dark, but that didn't stop the scum of Fhloston Paradise to stop drinking. A holographic band played in one corner while a group of tough Space Jocks payed a game of cues. The red light district girls were hanging off the arms of their men. Rakat grimaced at the first swallow of her drink, the bitter taste wasn't enjoyable but it made her warm. Two days ago it had been. Rakat had dropped off Zorg at the repair dock. He had proudly walked off, carrying his gun under his arm. Didn't even give a bit of money, Rakat thought to herself with a smirk. But she was glad to be rid of him. She had worked the other day on her ship. Trading objects for the parts of her ship that were missing. Her singlet even more oil splattered than before. Her presence in Fhloston hadn't gone unnoticed either. Most of the bounty hunters that were floating around had made up excuse to visit the docking yard. She had just scowled at people she saw and kept working. A big shock came early in the afternoon, when the sun was making long shadows. She was on her back under the ship; she had just connected two oil cables resulting in most of her shirt ad hair getting soaked in old ship oil. She spied a pair of shiny brown boots close to where her own legs were sticking out from under the ship. \"Go away,\" she said in her rough voice. She quickly welded the connection, and realising the person hadn't moved, quickly rolled from under the ship. \"Listen buddy, I said...\" she stopped short. In front of her was a very handsome man. He had dark brown hair that was slicked back. He had a tan coat over his arm and was wearing a white shirt and brown pants, and of course the brown boots. Rakat's eyes narrowed. \"Jacob Skyline\" Jacob gave Rakat a large smile that would have sent any woman in a swoon. Rakat's own mouth was set hard. \"Rakat Dell, I haven't seen you since…\" \"Since you left me for dead on a moon,\" Rakat finished him off. Rakat quickly pulled out a pistol from her belt. Jacob's smile didn't lessen. His was the type of smile to look dazzling, but if analysed it would be a type of smirk. \"Ah yes, you're as fast as ever. I've been curious of how you got out of that situation\" Rakat gestured with her gun to a dotted tattoo her amongst the others on her arm. \"The law picked me up, which you probably planned\". Jacob had a mock look of hurt on his face. \"I can't believe you'd think of me like that, Rakat. Actually, I just came by now because I heard you were alive. I wanted to show you there are not hard feelings, on my part anyways\". Rakat snorted. \"After all you've done? Tell me right now why I shouldn't kill you?\" \"I owe you money,\" Jacob said, giving Rakat a cool smile again. \"Oh yeah, there was that,\" Rakat agreed, she put her gun back in her holster. \"Actually Rakat, as you can see I've come into a bit of money recently,\" Jacob explained. \"That would explain why you're talking all high and mighty, and wearing shiny boots,\" Rakat said. Jacob just smiled and took a card from his pocket. \"This is where I live now; I won a small moon in a bet. I owe you a favour, so call it in anytime.\" \"Gee, thanks,\" Rakat said, rolling her eyes. She slipped the car into her back pocket. Silence followed her remark. Rakat raised her eyes and found Jacob looking at her with misty eyes. \"I've never forgotten you, Rakat,\" he said slowly. Rakat swallowed the lump in her throat. \"You best be leaving, Jacob, before I hurt you,\" Rakat stalked off behind her ship to seem busy while covering her red face. When she thought it safe, she glanced over and saw the tall handsome man was gone, and only a set of his footprints remained in the dusty ground. Rakat had finished another drink before she knew it. The auto-tender had filled her glass again without her noticing. She rubbed her temples and realised the alcohol was taking effect. Near the entrance, close to the cue tables, there was loud shouting. \"No, mate, you ain't aloud in,\" came the cry of the bouncer. A few gang members rose from the cue tables and stood in front of the man who hurried in. \"Didn't you hear the good man outside?\" growled the beefiest man. \"I've come to see Rakat Dell!\" came a familiar drawl. Rakat took a better look, and saw Zorg amongst the large men. He was trying to get through. She saw that there was no way he was going to get to her. Slowly she made her way over, the alcohol making her a little dizzy. She tapped the beefy man on the shoulder. \"Oi mate, he said he wanted to talk to me, let him through\". The man blinked at her and let out a large laugh which was accompanied with a whiff of bad breath. \"You ain't no famous bounty hunter, you is a little girl,\" he said pushing her backwards. Rakat regained her footing, her fists clenched. She grabbed the mans shoulder and wheeled him around, and made a heavy punch to his jaw which made him falter backwards and fall onto a chair. \"Let him through,\" she said again. The rest of the gang members shrank back, while they let Zorg through. He followed Rakat back to the bar, where she took another drink. \"Thank god I found you, Rakat. I need you're help again,\" Rakat rubbed her knuckles. It seemed everyone needed her help these days. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Sorry bout the whole suicide thing, I just needed a character that had nothing to live for… So yeah, something along those lines. Sorry if I upsetted any of yous. Thanks for all your reviews![Chapter 5] Rakat wasnabout to put her ship into hyper drive when movement from behind herncaught her attention. She glanced over her shoulder and glared atnZorg, who was sitting at the small table. \"Look,nyou either be quiet or I'll drop you off at Pluto\" Zorgnfrowned at her, and stood up to take the seat next to her. Once henhad fastened himself he turned to look at Rakat. \"So, whynare you so touchy?\" he asked. Rakat kept he eye to the windscreen. \"Indidn't think I'd have to take you somewhere, especially tonearth,\" she said. \"Don'tnlike earth?\" Zorg questioned. \"Nope\" \"But itnis your birthplace, right?\" \"Yes, innthe slums of New York\" \"Oh\" Thenconversation was cut there. The ship bleeped and announced that thenpath was clear in hyper space. Rakat changed gears and tightened hernseatbelt. \"Holdnon,\" she instructed. The ship was launched into hyper space. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI When Zorgnhad asked her for help in the bar, she could do nothing but listen.nHe described how, for some reason, no one would take him to earth.nRakat was not interested in returning to earth. Zorg bribed andntalked her into it, for a large sum of money of course. When leavingnFhloston, Rakat had a feeling Zorg was keeping something from her. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI \"Shipnregister 10826,\" Rakat told ground control. \"Enter\" Rakat'snship shot towards earth. \"There'sna private pad on top of my building,\" Zorg instructed, \"it'snmeant for smaller crafts, but I think that you'll be able to do itnproperly\". Rakatnnodded as she controlled she ship on entry. The ship bumped a bit andnthen it stopped. They flew over wasteland and came in view of NewnYork's sprawling smog with buildings piercing the sky. Zorg pointednto one of the medium buildings. \"What?nNot the largest one there Zorg?\" Rakat teased. Zorg just scowled. \"Fundingnproblems\" he said. Rakatnpulled up as they entered the New York traffic. The flow was constantnand heavy, they got to the building in five minutes. Rakat pulled thenship upwards when they reached the Zorg Building. Shencarefully landed it onto the top and shut the ship down. \"Here wenare,\" Said Rakat, stating the obvious. She still wasn't toonpleased about being in New York again. The both unbuckled their beltsnand went outside, where the wind was buffing them. Zorg fumbled innhis pockets and bought out two thousand credit bars. He handed themnto her. \"I'llnsend the other three thousand when I get to the bank,\" he promised.nRakat just nodded. \"Makensure you do.\" There wasnan awkward silence for a while. \"Inappreciate you taking me Rakat\" Zorg said. Rakat grimaced. \"Nonproblems. I'll leave in a few minutes, one of the parts came loosenin re-entry\" she told him. Zorg jerked his head. \"Well,nsee ya\" he held out his hand. Rakat eyed it, and then carefullynshook it. They both held eye contact for a second, and then Zorgnturned around and walked towards the elevator doors his leg makingnits distinctive clinking noise. Rakatnwatched as he entered the elevator and the doors closed. She hoped itnwould be the last she saw of him. She opened a compartment on thenoutside of the ship. There was a bunch of wires, some which had comenloose. Rakat set to work. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Zorgnthought about Rakat as he took the elevator down. Cute girl,nhe thought, but not my type. The elevator bleeped as it stopped atnhis floor, he took out a card and swiped it to open the doors. He let outna sigh as he walked down the short corridor, finally home. He glancednat his receptionist's desk. She wasn't there, but that wasnexpected. She was probably trying to look for him. He walkednthrough the large doors and his eyes were greeted with familiarnsurroundings. Butnsomething wasn't right. Zorg frowned as someone sitting at his desknlooked up, a thin red haired man in his middle ages. \"Who arenyou?\" Zorg demanded. The man just smiled. \"My namenis Thomas Merridew,\" the red head announced. Zorg just frowned. \"I'dnadvise you to get out of my chair before I call security\" Thomasnlaughed. \"I'mnhere on business, Zorg\" \"Whatntype?\" \"Mr.nShadow's\" Zorg palednand swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat. \"Wh-nwhat do you mean? He should be dead\" \"Oh no,\"nreplied Thomas, \"evil never dies\" Thomas gotnup from his chair and went to stand near the window. \"Mr.nShadow is very disappointed in your failure. He has instructed me tondo away with you, to bring down your empire, exploit your weaknessesnand finally, to kill you.\" Zorg justnstared, wide eyed. Thomas smirked. \"Nothingnto say, Zorg? That's a first\" \"Why arenyou doing this?\" Zorg asked. Thomas's eyes narrowed. \"It'snyou. It's your fault my life is in ruins. It's you fault that mynwife left me along with my children. It's your fault that I havennothing to live for. It's your entire fault\" Zorgnrealised that he was talking to a crazy man, and that he had tondefend himself. He glanced around and spied a ZF-1 gun displayed onnthe wall. Thomas followed his gaze and laughed. \"Younthink it would be that easy, Zorg?\" Thomas pressed a button on thenlarge desk and Zorg turned around to find two large body guards. \"Restrainnhim,\" Thomas ordered. Zorg's eyes darted to the body guards thatnused to pledge loyalty to him then to the gun on the wall. The twonlarge men advanced on Zorg, as they grabbed at him Zorg ducked underntheir arms. He considered grabbing the gun, but there wasn't enoughntime. \"I saidnget him,\" Thomas yelled from behind. Zorg didn't look back as henran towards the elevator; he jabbed at the button waiting for thendoors to open. He glanced over his shoulder and saw the two mennrunning down the corridor. Zorg entered the elevator and pressed thenbutton to close. Just as the men reached the elevator, the doorsnhissed shut. Zorg let out a sigh of relief, and then a loud sirennpierced his ears. Thomas hadnalerted the security and police, Zorg figured. The doors hissed opennagain and he realised he was on the roof again. Thankfully Rakat wasnstill there; she had just closed the compartment with a snap andnturned around. \"You setnoff the alarms?\" she asked angrily. \"There'snnot time to explain, get in,\" he quickly said. Rakat kept hernground and sneered. \"Whynshould I?\" Thenelevator doors opened again and five large security guards pourednout. One of them raised his gun and took a shot; it hit the side ofnthe ship. Rakat frowned. \"Getninside,\" she instructed Zorg. Pulling out her pistol she madentwo shots which found their mark, killing two of the men. She let offnanother shot before following Zorg into her ship and closing thendoor. Rakat heard shots ringing off the ship as she slid into hernseat. The security men had made their way to the windscreen and werenshooting at it. Rakat lifted off, and using one of the ships gunsndowned two more men. She noticed more men pouring out of thenelevator. As the ship went over the edge of the building the computernwarned of three police cars targeting her. She glanced over to thenleft and saw the cars positioned and waiting. She frowned slightly,nand then pushed the steering controls towards the ground. The shipnnosedived down the building; Rakat clenched her knees to her seat tonstop falling. Zorg wasn't so lucky; he smashed into the back of hernseat with a cry. Rakat nearly lost her grip, but she kept holding on.nShe levelled out the ship just before the smog. Glancing at her radarnshe saw no police cars followed behind, and then she noticed two innfront of her. They let out a round of shots, shattering thenwindscreen making heavy duty glass spray on her. Frowning,nRakat prepared one ship missile and with careful aim, she sent itnspiralling towards the first police car. It hit on the side, makingnthe car loose half its side and propel into the second car where itncaused much damage. The radarnshowed three more police cars approaching. She didn't wait andnpushed the ship down into the smog and was lost to them. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Rakatnwiped at the dirty mirror in front of her. Rakat hadnled them to a slum apartment. She had told Zorg that she owned it,nand hadn't visited it in seven years. She sighednand cleaned the glass to look at her face. There were tiny rivers ofnblood from where the windscreen glass had pierced her. The grimacednas she removed the glass and washed her face from the dirty dustynsink. When shengot to the kitchen she found Zorg sitting at a chair with his head innhis arms. Rakat to the seat across from him and cleared her throat. \"Whatnhappened?\" she asked, \"did you know this was going to happen?\" Zorgnlooked up. \"I didnknow I was a wanted man, in Fhloston none of the travel ships wouldntake me in fear of bounty hunters. That's why I came back to you.nThere is a man named Thomas Merridew who has taken my company and itnplanning my downfall,\" Zorg became silent, \"all because of anpromise I didn't keep\" Rakatnwaited for him to continue. \"I wasnan accomplice to Mr. Shadow who was planning to destroy earth,\"nZorg said quietly. Rakat frowned slightly. \"Nownthis Merridew guy is going to find my skeletons in my closet,\" hencontinued. \"Well,nthat's a fix,\" Rakat told him. Zorg nodded. \"Willnyou still help me? I want to hire you as a personal body guard\" henasked. Rakat smiled. \"I don'tnknow, I'm sure to get a large amount of money if I hand you in. ButnI don't want to hand you to this Shadow man who wanted to destroynthe earth. Infact, why did you want to destroy it?\" Zorgnlooked ashamed. \"Money\" Rakatnnodded and fell silent. \"Despitenwhat I feel, I think that I should help you,\" she finally said.nZorg smiled for the first time. \"Thanknyou, Rakat\" Rakatncoloured slightly and shrugged. \"Mightnas well, money is money. What are you planning for tomorrow?\" \"I'mngoing to go to one of my storage containers, and then I'll contactnone of my people to see what's happening. I'm a wanted man now,nso your work will be cut out for you\" Rakat justnnodded in agreement. \"Mightnas well get sleep for tomorrow,\" she said. \"Right,\"nZorg agreed. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Thank younto my reviewers- NajaMoonshadow , BlackSparrow06 and MartenKeeper .nYou all make me want to write more chapters, which is a good thing.nThanks Wow, Indon't know why Rakat want's to help Zorg... Just goes to show I'mnnot a really good writer :P Actually,nI'm not sure if I can write Rakat's character well. She's antough chick who would kill at the drop of a hat. But I'm a girlnwho's never fought in my life, so I'm not really sure how tonwrite her… I guess I'll figure it out :P[Chapter 6] A new day was dawning. Although at the bottom of the smog you couldn't see it. Rakat looked out onto the lighter grey fog that was rolling past her window. Zorg was snoring softly on the small couch near the door. Rakat held the gun tightly in her lap and wondered what she had gotten herself into. She was so wrapped up in her thoughts that she didn't hear Zorg's snores stop. \"You been up long?\" he asked her in his drawl. Rakat's head snapped towards him, her heart quickened. \"You scared me,\" she said, turning her body towards where he was sitting. \"Why didn't you wake me?\" Zorg asked, scratching his face, where a shadow of a beard was growing. Rakat just shrugged. \"I thought you might have liked a little bit of a rest, seeing as you won't be able to rest for a while,\" she said, \"being on the run is no good for resting\" Zorg nodded in agreement. Rakat pulled out a large knife from her leg sheath and threw it to Zorg, who fumbled. \"A beard isn't a good look for you, Zorg,\" she said. Zorg rubbed his chin, \"I think it might be, seeing as I'm wanted\" \"Your clothes wont match, nor will your hair,\" she eyed his fashionable hairstyle, \"you're a Grade-A fop\" Zorg's face was deep in thought for a moment. \"It'll all have to go\" Rakat didn't think that he was being serious, until he got up and locked himself in the bathroom. She knew that Zorg had a reputation for being fashionable and sophisticated in everything he did. Now he was going to ditch it all. She heard the water running, then much cursing coming from the bathroom. Looking towards the window, Rakat prepared to wait. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI It was mid morning when the bathroom door opened again. Rakat was dreading what Zorg looked like. She would rather him looking like a business man than anything else, it just suited him. She turned her head and instantly tried to hold her face still. Zorg had left his stubble, but cut his hair. He had removed the fashionable head piece and tried to place his hair so it covered the shaven side, cutting it so it didn't hang long. His clothed were still the same, very messy and dirty from the harsh environment it had been through. Rakat thought he looked ridiculous, she wondered if it actually took him that long to cut his hair. \"Well, I failed,\" he drawled. Rakat shook her head, trying not to smile. \"Oh no,\" she lied, \"you look fine… Hey, hows about you let me help?\" Zorg just scowled at her. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI After she had given him some different clothes, Zorg didn't look half bad. At least better than he did before, Rakat didn't think that anyone would notice him. Hopefully no one knew he was travelling in her ship. Rakat hadn't been to New York in seven years, so she didn't think they would know. Zorg now sat on the couch with a cigarette between his teeth, his fashionable clothes replaced with a long pair of trousers, grey shirt and brown leather jacket. Rakat couldn't look at his hair without laughing, so he gave him a woollen hat, which was pulled low. He didn't look half bad, Rakat had thought to herself. \"We better go now,\" Rakat told him. Zorg took a last drag of the cigarette and stubbed it out on the arm of the couch. \"Where to first?\" she continued, as she closed the door and locked it, for maybe another few years. They briskly walked down the dark hallway towards the ship dock. \"Warehouse, we need some guns,\" Zorg said. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Rakat's ship had made it to one of Zorg's warehouses. By flying low and taking back streets they had got to the warehouse without raising any attention. The warehouse was sandwiched between rows of others; there were many boxes and crates piled up with a few men in moving vehicles towing other containers around. There was a large space in front of one of the large warehouse doors, where Rakat lowered the small fighter ship. The doors opened and both Rakat and Zorg stepped out. \"Don't take too long,\" Rakat said, with a rough undertone. She didn't like the slums. Zorg patted his chest to see if the gun holster Rakat had given him was still there. It was, along with the gun. He limped his way towards the half open roller doors with the number '14' written on the side. Zorg lit a cigarette as he went inside. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Rakat glanced around. She didn't enjoy going to places like this, always too much cover and too many shifty character. Movement from the workers made Rakat reach assuring to her gun at her waist. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Zorg's eyes adjusted to the dark showroom. There were many clean steel shipping containers stacked in the large room, making it dark and crowded. Zorg spied an office, with lights spilling through half open blinds. Stalking over to the door, he listened at the voices inside before knocking. The murmuring stopped and a voice cried out, \"Enter\". Zorg dropped his cigarette and stood on it. With one sweeping movement, he opened the door, stepped inside and closed it again. He was faced with a man pointing a gun at him. Actually, there were two men, but one couldn't lift a gun, let alone shoot it. The man pointing the gun was Rusty; he was a large black man with a bald head. He let out a laugh and lowered his gun. \"Zorg, I would never in a million years expect you to show up,\" his southern accent deep, as he nodded to the other man, \"Lefty and I had no idea\". Lefty, the other man, had no arms. His shirt sleeves were rolled up and pinned; he rolled a cigarette around on his lips and took a drag. Zorg looked to both of them in turn. \"What do you mean?\" Lefty stared at Zorg, \"You mean, you don't know?\" his voice tone quiet, he glanced to Rusty who returned the glance, \"being wanted all over the galaxy for multiple murders and terror plots.\" Zorg just blinked, \"Oh, thank god, I thought you were talking about something else\" he let out a laugh, which was joined, nervously, by the other two. \"I've come here for guns\" \"Zorg, I don't know if you know, but many of the men around here are sleazy bags. I bet right now they're out there planning to get that bounty on you. You shouldn't even be here, we're trying to save your butt and ship all this stuff out,\" Rusty told him in a gruff voice. \"I know, and I thank you both. But I need some guns. Don't worry, I have protection,\" Zorg said, taking a look out of the blinds. \"Who?\" Lefty asked, blowing out smoke. \"Rakat Dell,\" said Zorg, turning back to them. Both were silent \"You're kidding,\" Rusty said, Lefty just breathed deeply on his smoke. \"Nope, the Bounty Queen herself is saving my ass,\" \"You sure about that?\" \"Well, we have an agreement,\" Zorg said with a smug smile. Both Lefty and Rusty looked at each other, Rusty then nodded and stood up. \"Follow then,\" Rusty led Zorg back out onto the showroom while Lefty stayed in the office. \"You know me and Lefty would do anything for you,\" Rusty told Zorg, weaving their way further into the storage containers, \"after the F-X War that we fought. I mean, geez man, what we wouldn't do for you.\" Zorg just nodded as his mechanical leg clinked along. \"I won't forget soon,\" he said, \"right now all I need is a few supplies\". \"That's what I mean, man. Why not just go and live a normal life. What I mean is, let go of your name, get yourself a wife and go live where no ones ever heard of Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg,\" Rusty said, stopping at a large shipping container, which he proceeded to open. \"You know I can't do that, Rusty. I've paid to get into the life I've always wanted and I won't let anyone push me out again,\" Zorg said furiously. Rusty stood silent, his back towards Zorg as he was busy with the container. Once open he took out a flashlight from his belt and stepped inside. \"Most of it's here,\" he said, pointing to different parts, \"there's the guns, that's some of the money you printed off, and over there are some other illegal supplies\" Zorg was already rummaging around. \"You got something I can carry stuff in?\" he asked. Rusty just pointed to some duffle bags on a crate. Zorg took on and stuffed it with a number of illegal devices. Rusty began to close up the container when a series of gun shots echoed. Zorg shouldered the bag and both he and Rusty ran to the front, where Lefty was standing. \"What's happened?\" asked Lefty. Rusty just shook his head as he slipped his gun to his hand and stepped outside with Zorg, two more shots rung out. Rakat was crouching behind a large crate, where she quickly popped up and took another shot at a group of men who were spread around hiding behind objects. There were taking shots at Rakat, but she had downed four men, while they had only succeeded in putting holes in the crate she was hidden behind. \"We have to leave, Zorg,\" she yelled in her grizzly voice. Some of the men spotted Zorg and Rusty and started to take shots at them. Zorg and Rusty ducked behind a towing machine. \"You weren't kidding, Zorg. You really have Rakat Dell,\" Rusty said with a grin. Zorg let out a curt laugh while he took the gun from his holster. Both men waited for the bullets to stop hitting the machine, and they raised their guns and took shots at the remaining men. Rusty shot two, while Zorg used his gun to good use and downed the rest of them. Getting up from behind the machine they joined Rakat. \"Rakat, this is Rusty. I fought with him in the F-X War,\" Zorg said, wiping the sweat from his head. Rakat and Rusty exchanged nods. \"I'm glad to be of service to an F-X War veteran,\" Rakat told him, extending her hand. Rusty shook it. \"Please excuse me,\" she said, and she made her way into the fighter ship. Zorg turned to fund Rusty grinning at him. \"Rakat Dell, eh?\" he said, slyly, \"I'd give anything to see what you two will get up to\" \"Why not come?\" \"I can't, man. Lefty and I are in this together. We're going to clean up your mess and go live the rest of our lives. But we'll come in arms, if you ever need us too,\" Rusty said, giving a slap to Zorg's back, \"see ya man\" Zorg just nodded, \"Say goodbye to Lefty. I'll send a postcard,\" Zorg entered the fighter ship, which was now humming and blasting fumes into the air. Rusty stood on the platform as the ship rose. He was sure he hadn't heard the last of Zorg. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Oh, Zorg make-over. I don't know, I like him as the gay evil man, but I thought he might need something more practical if he was going to run from the law… Eh, it just flowed out of me it's not my fault --; Thanks to reviewers again, I like reviews. Give me some ideas on what should happen, or what you though of it. I like constructive criticism. thanks again! The F-X War is just something made up. It was a war that helped Earth gain more planet territories, and defend against hostile aliens. Zorg was in it as a young boy, and so were Rusty and Lefty. Zorg saw that weapons in warfare were pretty crappy, so he decided to make his living out of producing new and better products.[Chapter 7] In the cold of space, a small fighter ship was rotating slowly. Inside, Rakat Dell was dosing in her chair with her feet propped on the dashboard. When suddenly a heavy weight landed in her lap, her eyes flew open and she grabbed at the ZF-1 that Zorg had thrown at her. \"What's this?\" her deep voice asked. Zorg sat in the chair opposite her with another gun in his hands. \"This is the newest gun I designed. Based on earlier models, with new additions,\" Zorg's southern accent sounded proud. He directed Rakat over the gun, \"There is a machine gun, flame thrower, net gun, missile launcher, freeze-cannon and a special replay button that makes bullets follow one previous shot\" Rakat turned the gun over in her hands, not liking the camouflage and sleek shape. \"It's an awful lot to have in a gun,\" she said frowning, there was a blinking red light on the bottom. \"What's this for?\" she asked. Zorg smiled, and then let out a barking laugh. Rakat just frowned. \"Not long ago I said that only a true killer would ask what that function is for\" Then he grew quiet, \"it's just a self-destruct button\" Rakat just raised her eyebrow, \"Is anything wrong?\" Zorg was silent for a while, then explained what had happened, how he had been contacted my Mr. Shadow to capture four important stones. How he had hired the Mangalores to get them for him, and how they failed. So he had given them the guns, not telling them about the destruct button. Then he had tried other ways to get to the stones, going to the hotel himself, killing a red haired woman that got in his way. All for nothing, he couln't find the stones and then got blasted by the damn Mangalore leader who he had thought he had killed. Rakat blinked, \"Do you know what happened to Mr. Shadow?\" she asked. Zorg shook his head slowly. \"Probably something big, that's why he's bothering me now. Otherwise I would have died awhile ago\" \"Actually, I think I heard something not long ago. While I was getting repairs in Fhloston\" Rakat said, she switched on the holoprojecter, that usually help her maps. She switched over to the ultra-net, which was mainly used on ships for gaining news headlines that were missed while in space. She flicked over to the earths headlines where it was filled with the same thing: Earth escapes disaster! New moon circling earth! Civilians in New York were terrified to see a large comet in the sky. Officials calm people and tell that there is nothing to worry about. Heroes save earth from doom- Corbin Dallas, an ex-war veteran along with a mystery woman. Popular radio presenter Ruby Rhod tells his story. Zorg's mouth dropped. \"So, this 'Shadow' guy had control over this comet thing and was going to crash it into earth?\" Rakat asked, very puzzled. \"No, I actually think Mr. Shadow was that comet. If you had heard his voice then you would understand. He doesn't seem to be real, I mean a real person. He just seems… to be evil\" Zorg wet his dry lips. Rakat shook her head. \"I've seen a lot of shit, Zorg, but never anything like what you're talking about\" \"Have you ever read anything by the old classic author Stephen King?\" Zorg asked, Rakat again shook her head, \"in many of his books he describes evil. Just evil itself, one entity that can control others and plans to destroy everything\" Rakat switched off the hologram. \"I still won't get my head around it until I see some proof.\" Zorg frowned at her; he gathered his gun and went to the back of the ship. Rakat just adjusted her seat and switched her ship into power. Their next stop was with a friend of Zorg's in the Golden Galaxy, which was a collection of planets belonging to rich people. She made sure the path was clear and switched to hyper speed. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Sorry it's taken me so long to update.. I'm lazy as --;; But don't worry, I should get some inspiration soon… Help me :( I used references to Stephen King because I've read heaps of his books, and they're mostly about evil as a being that's just… evil. I don't know how to explain it... I guess Mr. Shadow is all the evil in the universe. Oh, Stephen King is known as 'classic' in Fifth Element because its set in the future and all :P[Chapter 8] The skynwas dark and it was cold. There was no silence; a dull rumbly thundernwas constant. The thunder was war, and Zorg was in the middle of it. Kneelingnin the trench he clipped ammo to his automatic Y-5 army gun. Thenunreliable army gun was heavy and bulky to take shots; the onlynadvantage was that it used the best ammo ever made. The ammo werenlarge slugs and they ripped holes through everything. Zorg wipednhis sweaty bloody hands on his pants and peered over the top of thentrench. The F-XnWar was being fought only to expand the Federated Territories. ThenFederated Territories were planets and star-systems that the Earthnhad gained through bargaining or war. But the F-X War seemed to takenthe cake. The Earth Government had called up arms, recruiting all mennwho were fit enough to hold a gun. Usually it was the army who didnthings like these, but the planets being taken were home to an aliennrace that didn't want to give up. There werentwo types of Aliens on the planet that they knew about. One was ansmall swarm, they were like large cockroaches which had extra legsnand were the size of small dogs. They had razor sharp pincers and innforce they could chew through a man in seconds. The otherntype were large and slimy, they're bodies were larger than a mansnand theirs legs long. And, due to the aliens large stingers, thenbrave men and women were being killed like flies. They also had annacid mix that was deadly when sprayed. There werenscreams from down the trenches. Zorg swore to himself. Suddenly therenwas movement around him his team leader, Sargent Dee'rolt, yelledndown as he led the rest of the team. \"Get yerngun at the ready, Zorg, the Swarm have reached the barrier\" Zorgnfumbled with the gun and rose to follow the group. A loud explosionnnearby rumbled the ground and send dirt and small metal parts rainingndown on the troupe. Zorg stumbled, but kept going. The barricade wasnone of the only strong points left in their defence against thenSwarm. Thenlow, strong building appeared at the end of the trench and the smallngroup climbed up the muddy walls onto level ground. They were greetednwith the sight of flashing ammo and a large of moving ground whichnturned out to be Swarm. \"Common'nyer pansies, lets get to it\" Sarg. Dee'rolt yelled. The group letnout an animalistic roar and lay into the Swarm. Zorgncouldn't see anything. He hadn't been in combat as terrible asnthis, he was sure nothing could be worse. From his left and right hensaw men getting covered in Swarm and their bones being left behind. \"Grenade!\"nsomeone yelled, Zorg ducked. He felt the heat as it blew apart twongroups of aliens, the black mass spread but came back together.nShifting his gun around, he shot the one that was rolling on thenground in agony. Everything else was a blur. The Swarmnseemed in frenzy, and suddenly from the distance came the othernaliens. The larger ones, one of the men let out a cry and a group ofnthem fired at the towering insects. The insects reached the men andnscattered them, which the Swarm covered and devoured them. The largeninsects started to attack the other men. Henremembered shooting to save many of his mates. He wasn't luckynother times, and his clothes got even bloodier from fresh cuts. Thenlarge aliens seemed to come from everywhere and he took it uponnhimself to try to shoot them all. It didn't seem that anyone elsenwas doing anything. Thennsomething happened, his gun jammed. The bullets locked in the dirtynbarrel of the gun, just when a large insect alien bore down on him.nRed filled his vision and he then fell into black. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI He awokenin a hospital tent with two men leaning over him. One was his friendnLefty, who lighted a cigarette and put it in his mouth. The other wasna man he didn't know, blonde and thin, probably a doctor. \"Glad tonsee you back,\" Lefty said, he moved away from Zorg. \"Younfeel alright to sit up?\" the Doctor asked. Zorg tried to speak butnhis mouth seemed full of cotton and had a metal taste. He nodded hisnhead instead. The Doctor helped pull him up in a sitting position;nZorg's head swam for a minute. \"You didnreally well, Zorg, the federation are thinking about giving you anbravery medal,\" Lefty said, taking a drag of his cigarette. Zorgngave him a questioning look. \"Yeah,nyou fought really well. The others in you group died, but you keptnfighting. My group came along in the nick of time, we saw you pinnednby an insect and the swarm were on you.\" Lefty gaventhe doctor a look, and the doctor nodded. \"Zorg,nbuddy, they took your leg\" Zorgncouldn't think after that. He looked down at the covers and noticednthere was no shape next to his other leg. He reached down his handsnand felt around. Pain filled his mind again. \"Wenfought the rest of the Swarm off. You basically saved the lastnbarrier. We've nearly beaten the buggers, Zorg\" Lefty told him.nZorg now wasn't listening; he was trying to think through the pain.nNot having a leg, how would he get through everything, it was thosendamn guns. The Doctorntook Lefty's arm. \"Zorg, Inhave to go now, my group and Rusty's are on patrol. We're goingninto the heart, we should make it, and they have no defences left.nSee you afterwards\" Lefty grasped Zorg's hand for a moment andnleft. The Doctor leaned over Zorg and injected something into hisnarm. Everything swum and went black. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI The armyngot to the heart of the Alien planet, but they got ambushed. Rustynand Lefty barely made it out alive. Lefty lost both his arms. The aliensnseemed to multiply and overpower the army. They had to retreat. Afterntwo more months of defeat the Federated Territories left the planet. Zorg got antop class mechanical leg and a Bravery Medal. His career expanded andnhe started designing war materials. He always thought that if the Z-FnWar guns were better they would have won. Lefty andnRusty also received Medals along with survivors of their teams. Thenstarted a large army surplus company which sold high grade material,nboth legal and illegal, to buyers. The Aliennplanet remained hostile. A few years later the Federated Territoriesnsent missiles and destroyed the planet. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Zorg awokenin a cold sweat. He reached down and felt the metal on his leg. Thennhe realised he was on Rakat's ship. Rakat was sitting in the diversnseat, head on her chest. Zorg wiped his brow, turned over and wentnback to sleep. IOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOIOI Hello,nhope you all have had a good holiday season. Happy New Year too! Tooknme a while to write this, but all is good. I finally have written outna basic storyline to follow. I did the epilogue thing at the end,njust as a bit of background of what had happened.

The blond girl stared at the door to her new home in apprehension. The only reason why she was here was because her mom was declared unfit to raise her and her sister and their dad was in jail. All of it had happened not very long ago. Her emotional wounds were still very fresh and she was in need of some sympathy, even if she didn't admit it.[Chapter 2] so i gave up on giving you guys an exclusive extended edition. it was just going to be too tiring. but don't fret. it's still action packed and everything. it's just shorter. Chapter 2 \"Oh crap.\" Danny said. He has not planned on someone else appearing along with Ally. Marie then noticed that they were no longer in her new home. They were now it what looked like a park. Then she looked right at who had spoken. \"Oh my god! You're that one guy from that one show!\" Marie shrieked pointing at Danny. \"Wow, you're very descriptive.\" Ally said sarcastically. \"Who is she?\" Danny asked Ally. \"Marie, my cousin.\" \"Ok.\" Danny said. Then, Marie freaked out. \"You're Danny Sinclair from that Greatest Kid Magician show!\" Marie shrieked, jumping up and down while waving her arms around frantically. She stopped jumping and clapped her hands. \"I'm so smart! I knew I recognized your sexiness from somewhere!\" \"Your cousin is definitely a threat to my sanity.\" Danny said to Ally. \"You try being related to her.\" \"Danny's too sexy for his shirt, too sexy for his shirt, so sexy it hurts.\" Marie sang dancing horribly. \"I think that we've already established that you think that my best friend is hot.\" ally said sharply, almost to the point of sounding jealous. \"She said that I'm sexy.\" Danny pointed out. \"Whatever. It's the same thing.\" Ally said in the same sharp tone. \"I think that someone's jealous.\" Marie said in a mocking tone. \"Why would I be jealous?\" \"Because I can freely say that he's hot, while you can't.\" \"Whatever. I could say that he's hot if I wanted to.\" \"Even if you wanted to, you wouldn't because you're too afraid of ruining your friendship.\" Ally obviously got annoyed at this comment. She turned to Danny. \"Danny, could you teleport her back to our house?\" \"Sure.\" Then, Danny used his magic to open another portal. Marie was sucked in and she was gone. \"Sorry about Marie. She's kind of crazy.\" Ally apologized. \"Yeah she is. But it's ok.\" \"You don't have to talk to her if you don't like her.\" Ally said her voice sounding a bit hopeful, as if she didn't want Danny to like her cousin. \"I actually like her. She's kind of cool.\" If Danny picked up on the hopeful sounding part of her voice, he chose to totally ignore it. \"You don't like her, like her do you?\" Ally said in a small voice. \"No. I barely even know her.\" \"Well, you might want to teleport me home before she breaks something.\" \"Yeah.\" Then, Ally was gone. so yeah. now you know where they went. there's 4 more chapters. maybe five or six if i flesh out a few of them. review. that's all i ask. even if it's negetive.[Chapter 3] well, i was thinking about just putting up a author's note saying what's at the end of the chapter but after i checked my email and saw the PM from disneyqueen i decided that it wasn't smart to leave you guys hanging. so yeah. on to the story. Chapter 3 The next morning, Marie woke up late compared to when she normally woke up. As soon as she opened her eyes she started to freak out. That went on for a few seconds until she remembered that she was at her new home. With that thought, she got out of bed and walked across her room the bathroom. In the bathroom she was getting ready to take a shower when she realized that there were three doors to the bathroom. One from her room, one to the hallway, and one to a mystery room. She opened the door to the mystery room a crack to peer into it. It was obviously a guys' room. It wasn't messy like the only other guys room that she had seen, which almost surprised her. When it dawned on her that it was Danny's room, she closed the door. She had this strange feeling that eventually she'd be in that room with permission. (a/n: a slight reference to the sequel of this story i guess. i dunno) The next day Marie was painting her room with the dark blue paint that she had boughten the day before. The music that she was listening to was so loud that she didn't even hear when Danny entered the room. \"Can I help?\" He asked. Marie jumped about a foot into the air. When she turned around it was obvious that he had scared her. When her eyes locked on him, they narrowed into little slits. She was mad. \"You...jerk.\" \"Sorry.\" He laughed. With that she flung paint in his direction. And the paint it its target. It was Danny's turn to be surprised. \"Oh, this means war.\" He walked over near Marie and grabbed a paintbrush, dipped it in paint, and covered Marie's shirt in paint with one swift stroke. Marie retaliated and soon they were both covered in paint. At this point, they were both laughing their heads off. \"Give up!\" Danny managed to say in between spurts of laughter. \"Neverrrrr!\" Marie shouted. \"Fine then, I give up.\" The paint war stopped. They both looked at themselves, the walls, and each other. \"I think that we have more paint on ourselves than we do the wall.\" Marie said visibly holding back laughter. \"Me too.\" They were standing only inches apart. Suddenly, their faces started to drift closer to each other's. It seemed as if their lips were magnetized and they were destined to meet. \"What are you doing?\" Ally asked as she came into the room. She hadn't seen Marie and Danny almost kiss. Now there was no evidence of it happening because there were feet in between the two. \"Nothing.\" They both said at the same time. They glanced at each other and blushed. \"You two are going to get in trouble.\" \"That sucks. I haven't been here for a week either.\" Marie said. \"Well, I'm going to go do my homework.\" Ally left the room. Marie started to leave and stopped by the door. \"I'm...going to go see if she needs me to explain something.\" Then, she rushed out of the room, leaving Danny by himself. note: This will be the final chapter for a while. i will eventually extend this chapter because i cut out a lot of it, but right now i have more important things to worry about than my writing. i hope you guys all understand. though if you want to talk to me about this story or something my email is in my profile and i have AIM, yahoo, and msn messangers. so review. yeah.[Chapter 4] okay i told DQ (disneyqueen, not dairy queen) thati would probably update tommorow a week or so ago but it wouldn't let me. and then i got grounded. and yeah i've had a lot change since i last updated. pm me for full details but let's just say one thing...never in a MILLION years did ithink taht what happened to me would happen...just in case you've got the bad idea, i'm not pregnant...that's not even legal for me yet...justa couple more months...and then...i dunno...on with the story... Chapter 4 \"It's nice to know that I funded a paint war.\" Ally's dad said. He was mad about what Danny and Marie had done earlier. Of course, they had left out the part about their almost kiss. \"Uncle, we're really sorry.\" Marie almost pleaded. She couldn't have an argument start. Not now, not ever. Ally's mom tried to smooth things over but it just made things worse. It got so bad that Marie had to leave the room. She dashed up the stairs and burrowed into a cocoon of pillows and blankets. Danny and Ally hadn't been far behind her. Ally also dashed into her room to do the same thing as Marie had. Danny opened the door to Marie's room to see what was up with her. You could hear furniture crashing to the floor downstairs but in Marie's room the sound was like a whisper in a crowded room. The sound was obsolete over the pitiful sounds of Marie crying. Danny was puzzled at why she was doing this but he decided to comfort her anyway. He found her amongst her cocoon and hugged her. She hugged him back as her cries slowly faded to whimpers. She sat up and wiped away her remaining tears. \"Thanks.\" she smiled. \"Why did you freak out so badly when your aunt and uncle started fighting?\" He asked. \"My past.\" Marie's tone said that she was still hurting from it. \"Ok.\" Danny decided to leave it alone. \"Just so you know it, I'll be here if you need someone to talk to.\" \"Thanks again.\" She hugged him again, glad that she had someone who truly cared. this chapter will have a lot more substance to it when i actually edit it from the english assignment version...yeah...only 6 chapters for now...later i'll delete this one and post them edited one or just post the edited one as a different story. one things for sure the ending won't suck quite so bad...the endings totally cliched...just a warning...2 more chappies til the end...[Chapter 5] ok so i'm ungrounded...for just tonight i think...but you guys will get the last 2 chapters tonight as a special thanks for waiting so long...btw...i got a 100 for this story in English...so YAY! Chapter 5 After everything calmed down Danny, Ally, and Marie were painting Marie's room. Ally was making fun of Marie's music taste, calling it warped. \"You''ll be saying that I have a warped music sense when I shove this paintbrush up your-\" Marie was cut off by Danny. \"Keep it PG!\" He screamed. \"I was going to say nose!\" Then, a song came one that almost matched the mood at that time. At first only Marie was singing but Ally joined in on the second chorus and Danny joined in on the third. \"When am I going to start school?\" Marie asked. \"Sometime next week. Mom thinks that you need some time off school.\" Ally said, \" Let's just hope that you don't get picked on as much as I do.\" \"You know, I could scare your bullies a way from you. With the help of Danny and his magic of course.\" \"How?\" \"I'll dress up like I was dressed the other day and pretend to put spells on people. Then, Danny uses his magic to make the spells happen.\" \"But what about Max? What if he's hanging out at your school?\" Danny asked. \"Why would he be hanging around a school of non-magic teens?\" \"You have a point.\" \"Exactly.\" Marie collapsed on the couch at 4 in the morning. She had been working on details on her walls and doors. As soon as she got comfortable, she was asleep. It didn't seem like she was sleeping for more than 5 minutes when she was woken up by bright lights in the kitchen. She looked to she who it was. It was her uncle. She went out into the kitchen and talked to her uncle. He apologized to her for what he said earlier, but it didn't matter much because he just got her mad at him again when he said that she was bipolar. umm...yeah you can review for this chapter but the next chapter is going to be up shortly anyways...so yeah...[Chapter 6] total amout of time it took me to type this story the night before it was due: like 7 hours...tries to get it to print correctly:at least 10...grade: 100...amount of time to tries to grade ratio: 7hrs/10tries/100prct...overall analysis: the 7 hours and million tries were worth it... Chapter 6 It was a week later and Marie was getting ready for her first day of school. She was willingly making herself a social reject but she didn't care. Much. She cared a little but that was for lunch purposes. It wasn't fun to sit by yourself during lunch. She was going to be a reject for quite a while. It would take a week for the strangeness to blow over and longer for her to make friends. She was shy to the point that she wouldn't talk t someone unless they talked to her first. 'Oh well.' She thought. 'Tis the story of my life.' She picked up her towel and walked into the bathroom. In the bathroom, she saw something that made her drool and scared her at the same time. When she opened the door she saw Danny without a shirt on. \"Um...hi?\" Marie was at a loss for words. She was momentarily stupefied. \"Oh. Hi Marie.\" Danny said, not making any move to grab his shirt which was laying on the floor next to him. \"Aren't you going to put your shirt on?\" \"Why should I? You seem to be enjoying the view.\" Marie blushed. \"Come get me when you're out of the shower and dressed.\" Marie said as she left the room. At school Marie/Danny put jinxes on almost every guy in the school except for the goth guys and the anime freaks that Marie befriended. She had fun her first day of school except for the run in that she had when she got home. When she walked in the door, Max was there grinning evilly. Danny was nowhere to be seen. Ally walked into the door right behind her and bumped into her where she stood. With a puff of smoke, a ring appeared on Marie's finger. It was a magical ring which sucked the magical powers out of the person who was wearing it. Max laughed like the evil guys from the movies do. \" I have your powers now!\" \"No you don't. I'm not really magic.\" Marie said. \"Those weren't my powers.\" \"That's right.\" Danny said as he came down the stairs. \"They were mine.\" Max seemed to be at a loss for words. And he never got to say any because at that moment, Danny used his magic to poof him away so he couldn't hurt any of them. Marie started to tug at the ring on her finger but it wouldn't come off. Ally grabbed the ring and pulled it off. \"Only someone other than the person who is wearing the ring can take it off.\" Ally explained. \"I'm hungry.\" Marie said. Then, a floating plate of macaroni and cheese appeared. \"That ring must've brought up some deeply buried magical powers.\" Danny said. \"Oh cool.\" Marie said. \"Yeah.\" Danny said. Then, without warning, he walked over to Marie and kissed her. Ally stormed up to her room. Neither of the two left behind appeared to notice it. \"I'm glad that Max didn't have time to do anything bad to you.\" He said. His forehead was resting against hers. \"Me too. I mean-\" \"I know what you mean.\" Then, they kissed again. note: i hate the ending...but at least it's not the real ending...and there's a sequel...it'll be written sometime...it's really good so far...ok so the first chapter is good...very dramatic though...and i have to say that Ally is the closest thing to a real bad guy in the sequel...but you'll see why in the extended version of this story...so yeah wait for that...and then wait for the sequel...and wait for me to finsh ranting...and i'll wait for someone to hand me my weight in ice cream cause i'm depressed...i'm stupid too...

Glancing from the bundle on his table tonthe messenger, he murmured a quiet, \"Where did you get this?\" Hassan blinked confusedly. \"From merchants traveling from the North.nApparently they spent a long time searching for whom they called Ibn, orn\"The Arab.\" Fortunately one of them spoke Latin and we were able tondiscover the identity of the recipient as the Ambassador to thenNorth...you.

Hassan's eyebrows rose in curiosity. \"Sir?\" Ahmed looked up and jerked slightly. He had forgotten Hassan was there.n\"Forgive me. I wish to thank you for bringing me this. Talib will see tonit that you are fed and paid for your trouble.\" Talib, one of Ahmed's servants moved forward from his place just outsidenthe door and gave a small bow to Hassan, motioning him to follow. Glancingnonce more to Ahmed, Hassan followed the servant from the room. Ahmed stood from his seat and approached the open windows, the humid breezencaressing his already flushed face. In his hand he gripped the figurenseverely, his knuckles white. Memories of what happened so long agoncrossed his mind. Absently, he placed his free hand on his face, slowlyntracing the three scars still there, but small and faded with time.nSixteen years, sixteen long years since he had viewed the shores of Venden,nor the face of Herger, a man he considered a good friend. Over the yearsnhe had wondered whether Herger was alive or dead...and he thought of her.nOlga.

After fighting beside them andnshedding blood with them, he saw them in a new light, one filled withnhonor, and humor. Now, with the memories of everything he had discovered both in himself, andnin the Northmen fresh in his mind, he brought the statue of The Mother upnto view it in the morning light. There was no confusion as to what thenmessage was. The wendol have returned to destroy Venden and it's peoplenonce again.

Remembering Herger's words to him the first night theynfought the Wendol, (where Ahmed subsequently received his three scars)n\"Your Fate is fixed.

Enjoy... Hassan clutched the railing in a death grip, his stomach rolling. The waves continued to pound against the sides of the longboat, a craft that had recently become a vessel of torture for the young man. His only saving of face was that the others in his party were under similar circumstances. Ahmed was weathering the storm well, but even he was feeling the effects of the sea. They had been sailing for many days, and the memory of land was beginning to fade from Hassan's mind. The only memory he seemed to recall now was the deep blue of the water, now inky black and threateningly violent. Waiting several seconds to ensure that his stomach would settle enough, he sank to the floor next to the heap that Talib had become. The poor young boy was huddled in a fetal position and his olive skin tone had paled to a dull gray.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I own and claim no rights to Touchstone Pictures' \"The 13th Warrior.\" All non-original characters are beings of my own creation, and similarities to other fics are unintended. The light from the numerous torches hanging around the large cave room shone brightly on the scene of blood and gore. Inhuman screams and roars mingled with the wails of terror coming from the three young girls in the center of a circle of onlookers. Woman and men covered in dirt, blood and animal skins pushed the girls back and forth around the circle, delighting in their fear and the crazed look that contorted their faces into masks of agony and the knowledge that death was near. High above them, on a ledge surrounded with large boulders to create a makeshift cage, seven girls stared down at the atrocity with resigned expressions of defeat. The sounds below grew in volume, and several of the girls clutched each other, whimpering. Suddenly, no sound but the wails from the three could be heard, and the circle of bear-skin clad creatures expanded until the three terrified girls stood at the center of the large arena. Two large men, on opposites sides of the room from each other pushed through the crowd, barely acknowledging the grunts of difference those around them gave. When they reached the girls, they had men from the crowd hold their arms and with a claw from around their neck cut a gash into their arm. With twin roars , the two warriors returned to their places outside the circle, on several rocks that gave them a view of the battle about to begin. Three female creatures from the crowd slunk forward on bent legs, their faces and bodies colored with paint and blood. Circling the three girls, they hissed and swiped at them, their wails adding to the rapture on their tormentors' faces. The seven girls above it all could only look as their friend's screams filled the cavern, only to change several moments later into gurgles of blood and gasps of pain. Then, all that followed was silence. With a look at the two warriors that watched the carnage above them, those in the circle roared in triumph and flew onto the near lifeless girls with abandon. Unna, one of the remaining captured endured the grip of Sefa, the youngest of them and watched the death of Theoun, Soma, and Asborg until her eyes could not withstand it. The huddled girls all moved away from the edge and moved to the center of their prison, whimpers of fear and despair joining the noise of ecstasy from below. Unna's stomach rolled, and if she had anything more than her own bile to spew, she knew she would have. They had all been captured four days earlier, most from the last raid of Venden's walls, some from the outlying farms and homesteads that were no match for the monsters that came in the night. Out of thirteen, only they seven remained. Unna squeezed young Sefa's arms soothingly, and hummed quietly to them all. One of the girls, Yrsa stood up and began to walk toward the lower level of the ledge that lead into the common area. Two guards flanked the opening, each holding a large spear. Unna released Sefa and followed after her, stopping the girl just before she could attempt to step outside their cage and into certain death. \"Yrsa, what are you doing?\" Unna demanded, pulling the girl around. Her friend's eyes were glassy and seemed to look straight through her. Unna shook her lightly to force the girl out of her madness. \"If they are to kill us, what is the point in trying to live? I would rather die now then endure this waiting,\" Yrsa panted franticly. She tried to jerk her arms out of Unna's hold, but the older girl held on tightly. The others wept even louder at Yrsa's comment and Unna shushed them quietly. \"We are not going to die, do you hear me,\" she said loudly. \"Do not make them get crazed with fear, we must be strong,\" Unna whispered fiercely to Yrsa. \"I want this to be over,\" Yrsa screamed. The resounding slap that followed made all the girls silent. Yrsa stared at Unna with disbelief, her hands covering her cheek protectively while Unna tried to control her angry breathing. \"If,\" Unna began, \"we are to survive this, we must stick together. We can not give in to our fears. Do you understand?\" Staring at each girl in turn, she waited until all agreed. A sound at the entrance of their prison had the girls flying to the far edge of the ledge. A large beast of a man stomped into their holding area, with a female not far behind him. The female threw two large chunks of meat at their feet, while the male tossed an animal skin at them, that they recognized as a water skin. In one beefy hand he held a torch that he thrust into the ground and then he and the female left as quickly as they had come. Cautiously the girls moved away from the edge and approached their captures' offering. With sighs of relief several of them grabbed for the water skin first, while Unna and Sefa stood beside the bloody meat. \"They are feeding us, finally after all this time,\" Sefa whispered. Unna turned away from the offering and began tearing into her underskirt. \"We have to get a fire going to cook this meat,\" she said quietly, keeping her back to the group so they couldn't see her revulsion. Yrsa was the first to notice Unna's behavior. Slowly she walked toward the girl, her mind reeling at the knowledge she didn't want to believe. \"This food they give us…it is not--\" \"It is food,\" Unna replied sharply, \"that is all we need to know.\" She grabbed the torch and turned to the girls. \"Now we need to get this fire started.\" She started at her work, while the other girls stared at the two pieces of meat in horror. The group pushed forward from the forest and Ahmed gazed in wonder at the difference of sixteen years on the budding kingdom. Many more homes dotted the hillside, and people stood outside tending their homes. As they passed the people stopped what they were doing to stare, uneasy whispers following them up the large hill that at the top stood the fortified structure of King Wigliff's castle. It had undergone many repairs and additions over the years which turned the hall of Ahmed's memory into a shadow of what it had become. The wooden spikes that surround it were a deadly and poignant reminder of the mission they were all on, as several men were still pulling the bodies of their dead and a few enemy carcasses from the wall. They passed through a tall gate and entered the courtyard where they were greeted by several armor clad warriors. Weath motioned the others to be still and urged his horse forward. An older man moved away from the ranks of men surrounding them and approached Weath, his expression grim. \"Welcome home my friends,\" he greeted amiably, though his face was less than welcoming. \"Ulfied, old friend, it is good to see you again,\" Weath greeted back, his eyes following the line of men, a grin on his face. \"Are you going to tell me what your grand king has ordered now?\" Ulfied grimaced before his face returned to its seemingly normal expression of unhappiness. \"I am to escort you to see the King,\" he replied gruffly. \"He insists that he meet with all of you as soon as you arrive.\" \"And of course the King must never be kept waiting,\" a new voice called out mockingly. The men on the ground parted as a boy strode toward the men on horseback. The armored men bowed as he walked passed, but he ignored them all and joined Ulfied. Weath dismounted and motioned the others to do so as well. The northmen in Ahmed's party all bowed to him, while he, Hassan, Talib and Tazeem watched in silence. \"Prince Munolfr,\" Weath greeted. \"You have returned finally,\" Prince Munolfr replied. \"Much has happened while you were gone.\" \"Who is this Prince Munolfr?\" Ahmed asked quietly to Egtho. \"He is…King Wigliff's…son,\" Egtho answered back stiltedly. Ahmed looked at the boy with a critical eye. The boy had long black hair tied back by a leather strap. He appeared lean, but strong, his arms and thighs bunched with muscle and hiding the agility of a jungle cat, Ahmed had no doubt. The respect the men gave the young prince was enough to convince Ahmed that whatever sins his father was guilty of, this boy was honorable and worthy. Dark blue eyes met his curious brown gaze and hardened into a cold stare. \"Many more of our women have been taken the past two months. We have ordered that the remaining farm and homesteads be abandoned and many are traveling here now for the safety of the castle,\" Munolfr informed them, his icy gaze never leaving Ahmed. It made the older man nervous. \"The King waited to long,\" Weath said angrily, \"he should have called for the people to come here when we left.\" One of the men that surrounded them stepped forward, the blade at his side pulled from it's sheath. He pointed it at Weath and made to charge, but a sharp word from Prince Munolfr stopped the man in his tracks. The prince pulled his own sword out and brandished it in the soldier's direction. \"Save your anger for the next battle, we need all the warriors we can get,\" he told him with icy fury that had the other man scrambling back into ranks in fear. Prince Munolfr replaced his blade and bide Weath and the others to follow him. \"Come, Ulfied and I will take you to greet the King.\" They all followed as the Prince led the way into the Great Hall. The people that littered the room ceased their conversations the moment they appeared, all but one man who seemed oblivious to their entrance. \"We know where their new lair is, all we need is a few men to go forward and attack. There is still a chance that we can save some of the women taken, if only you would agree--\" the blonde northman who's face was normally jovial and excited was now twisted with frustration. \"If you wish to pull men into a mission of death, that is your problem, but I refuse to use perfectly good soldiers that are needed here to help you die,\" interrupted the sandy haired man seated at the throne. \"Besides Herger, we all know you only wish to do this because your beloved daughter is among the women captured. Feeling guilty that you left her alone to fend for herself are we?\" the King taunted. \"I left my daughter in the care of your men here at the castle because I believed she would be safe. It was my mistake to trust a cowa--\" Herger fired back angrily. \"What is that? How dare you!\" King Wigliff yelled at Herger as he shot up from his throne, his face turning a deep purple. \"Sire,\" Prince Munolfr called loudly. \"What?!?\" the King roared, turning to the entrance. \"Here stands the hero Weath, son of Weagunnr returned from across the sea to join us in honorable battle,\" Ulfied announced. \"So,\" King Wigliff began, his pointed face breaking out in a sneer, \"you finally returned to us, have you? Well there now Herger, your little group of misfits is back. Maybe you will get them to agree to your little plan. After the work on the outlying defenses is completed, of course.\" Wigliff laughed happily at this. Glancing over the group standing at the entrance, he noticed Ahmed and his party for the first time. \"Well is this not a pleasant surprise? The Arab has returned. Come to fight with your great friends again? How kind. Munolfr,\" the King called. \"Yes sire?\" Munolfr answered grudgingly. \"See to it that the Arab and his three friends are given accommodations, and have all these men fed. Call your mother to see to their meal. We must not let them go into battle without a last meal,\" Wigliff chuckled. Still laughing to himself the King left the room, three guards trailing behind him. \"Ulfied call my mother and grandmother to the Hall to see to our guests,\" Munolfr ordered. \"But the Queen--\" Ulfied protested quietly. \"I am aware of the problem, but the King has ordered her to see to their meal. Call my mother and grandmother to the hall,\" Munolfr interrupted impatiently. \"Little Brother!!\" a shout broke through the hushed conversations, and even Munolfr could only shake his head as Herger rushed forward and engulfed Ahmed in a rough embrace that pulled the man off his feet. Both laughed together before Herger replaced his friend on his feet and thumped him on the shoulder with one hand. \"It has been a long time my friend,\" he grinned. \"Far too long,\" Ahmed agreed. \"It is good to see you.\" \"And I to see you. There is much that we need to discuss Little Brother. Much has happened,\" Herger told him. \"I can see that,\" Ahmed nodded toward the hallway the King had just entered. \"How did you survive the rule of such a devious man?\" \"Very carefully,\" Herger replied. A loud commotion erupted in the Hall as two women entered from a hallway directly in from of them. A woman in a faded white dress walked proudly into the hall, her blue eyes twinkling in challenge, a woman in black following closely behind. The first's blonde hair was long and flowed freely down her back and partially covered her face, but nothing could hide the large purple bruises that covered most of the left side of her face. Her lip was swollen and cut, yet none of this took away from the obvious beauty of her small heart shaped face. The second woman was more demurely dressed, her dark brown tresses were tamed back in a severe braid, and her form was covered in black. Wise brown eyes surveyed the room guardedly, taking in those that remained. Ahmed could feel his heart stop for several beats before it speed up. \"Olga,\" he whispered softly. Prince Munolfr moved over to greet Olga, his hands taking both of hers carefully, before he brought them both to his forehead. \"Mother, the king has ordered you see to the meal for our men returned from a long voyage.\" \"Mother!\" Ahmed exclaimed in surprise. \"Then that would make her…\" \"Like I said Little Brother, we have much to discuss,\" Herger answered, as all eyes centered on Olga, Venden's Queen.

Might be a little OOC but... Enjoy! Ping Pong In the Forrest household, all was good and well. Jenny has died a month ago, but life carried on. Little Forrest Gump Jr. was fascinated by the ball moving back and forth. His dad was a master at ping pong. Little Forrest always wondered where his dad learned it. He set down his favorite book, Curious George , and started walking up to his Dad, who was hitting the ping-pong to the wall, which would bounce back to him. \"What's up little For-rest?\" he asked. \"Daddy, where'd you learn how to play ping pong?\" Little Forrest asked. Forrest Sr. set his son on his lap and replied, \"Well, I was in the ar-my and I was hea-ling.\" \"From your wound?\" Forrest Jr. asked. He always asked his dad about his life. To Forrest's curious mind, it was very fascinating. \"Yes. I got bo-ored so I started playing ping-pong. I just happened to be a natural at it!\" his dad said, making the gears in Forrest's head start turning. \"Later, I got to be on the na-tio-nal ping-pong team. I went to this far off place called Chi-na,\" his dad continued. Little Forrest had heard about China. Some of the older kids were learning about it. \"But now, I don't need that. I've got you,\" his dad said, kissing him on the head. \"Daddy, can you teach me how to play ping-pong?\" Forrest Jr. asked. With a smile, Forrest Sr. replied, \"Of course For-rest.\" Taking his son off his lap, his smile reached from one ear to the other as her gave his son a paddle and help his sons arm, saying, \"First...\" His words slipped of his lips into the evening gloom, the wind carrying it as it rustled the leaves.

[ If you know where that is from, 100 on"},{"Movie":"13th Warrior","Title":"Against the Tide of Years","Author":"solnishka","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12989544","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So it's currently 932 BCE, and I am lost somewhere in the wilderness of what will eventually become Central Asia. Less than six hours ago it was half-past 9PM in 2018, and I knew exactly where I was on the University of Pennsylvania campus. The more I see of this place the more I think I might have accidentally breached the fabric of space/time, which is… bad. I'm not a physics major, but I think I broke at least three of the universe's laws of How Reality Is Defined—and let's not even get started on the potential philosophical/theological implications; it's too much. If I think about this for more than a few seconds at a time I feel like I'm on the edge of a nervous breakdown, so… I won't. I won't think about it . I'm just going to keep writing in this journal, and by the time I'm finished recounting everything that's happened today I will not want to curl into a fetal position and scream. There. Okay. Where to begin? I guess I should start by saying that this isn't my journal. It's the notebook I use for my Latin class notes. I'm an undergrad studying for a degree in history and hoping to specialize in the classical era, specifically Hellenic Greece—hence the Latin. I attend UPenn and live in a suite in Harnwell House with Summer, Rachel, and Fatima, who is an exchange student from Turkey. Now that I think about it (carefully avoiding any breakdown-worthy material), it's all Summer's fault that I'm lost in medieval Central Asia. Really! See, she's wiccan and raised by hippies, and people make fun of her. Not in a really bad way—nobody is (was? will be?) spray-painting slurs on our door and saying she deserves to be burned at the stake—but they said her beliefs were stupid and childish and that her spells don't actually work. Fatima, who is Muslim, is especially disapproving. I kept my mouth shut and tried to be a gentle, supportive suite-mate, but I agreed with the last bit of criticism: magic isn't real. Hogwarts doesn't exist. You can't lay out some crystals in a pretty pattern, wave a wand, and rearrange the matter of the physical world. Hell, you're not supposed to be able to time-travel, either. I found Summer crying in the kitchenette of our suite and tried to cheer her up. I made her a cup of peach tea (from my super-secret tea stash, no less) and we sat down at the table so that she could have some company while crying out her woes, which entailed patting her shoulder and agreeing when she said that life just wasn't being fair to her. Eventually, she got the idea to perform a spell to \"improve Harnwell House's energy\". I was trying to be a good person when I agreed to help her do it, honest; I didn't care about the \"energy\" of Harnwell House. I thought the spell was complete and utter bullshit. I agreed to go out and get the materials from the crafts shops and ethnic grocery stores around Philadelphia. The candles and chalk were easy, but it took forever to find the frankincense. It was dark by the time I got back to campus, and I was pissed at myself for signing away so much of my evening. Awkwardly wedged into my bag with the \"magical\" supplies was a copy of Beowulf , which I needed to lug on over to the library and bury myself in overnight for the sake of a literature class, and Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War in the original Classical Greek, which would be a much more enjoyable re-read for the sake of an essay about religious sentiment among Greek intellectuals. Everyone else in the class was using translated copies; I was hoping to exploit my fluency in Classical Greek for a few extra points. Eh, I'm rambling. The point is that, as I was crossing the road back to Harnwell, I had a backpack with frankincense, candles, chalk, a copy of Thucydides' History , Beowulf , and this notebook for my Latin class. And then I was hit by a car. …I can't remember much about the car. The only things that come back clearly are being blinded by the headlights and having a moment to think \"oh SHIT\" and then—nothing. Which is probably for the best; would anyone actually want to remember their bones shattering and their organs being crushed into jelly as a half-ton-and-a-bit of steel slams into them at 50 mph? They'd be traumatized. So. I had the \"magical\" supplies in my backpack when I was hit. Their purpose was to be used in a spell that would change the \"energy\" in Harnwell House (presumably so that people would stop bullying Summer). I didn't know how to do the spell; I drew no pentagrams with the chalk before the car hit me, I lit no candles, I chanted no words. And yet, when I opened my eyes, I was lying in the middle of a treeless steppe of rolling hills, without a road or building in sight. Standing over me was a bearded, scowling man wearing a robe and some kind of headdress. He was holding the reins of a horse that was cropping grass next to his feet, and speaking a language I didn't understand. The man spoke. He was middle-aged, with dark skin, hair, and eyes. He wore no jewelry or ornamentation of any kind, and his robe was made of black and grey striped panels. Neither his tone nor the expression on his face were kind. \"I don't understand,\" I said. More words, again in that same language. \"I'm sorry, but I don't understand.\" More words, and he seemed to be getting impatient. \"Do you speak English?\" He didn't attempt to speak this time, and just regarded me with a stony expression. I sat up slowly, blinking in the bright sunshine. I flexed my fingers and looked down at my hands, which were whole and undamaged. I looked at my legs, which were the same, and wiggled my toes in my sneakers—fine, just fine. Everything was fine. In my mind's eye, the glare of headlights overwhelmed me, and I heard the blare of a horn and someone screaming—maybe me, maybe the driver, maybe someone else entirely. I shivered. The man said something for the fourth time, this time in a slightly gentler tone. \" ¿Hablas español ?\" I asked. I'd taken the bare minimum of Spanish in high school. I wouldn't be able to say much, but I could establish that I was an American citizen, and he could help me find an English-speaker or, better yet, an embassy or consulate. The man made no reaction, however. I sighed. \"Do you speak Greek?\" I asked haltingly, in that language. I was better at reading than speaking. But even so, I wasn't speaking modern Greek—this was the Greek of Thucydides and Herodotus, who had lived and died 400-some years before the birth of Christ. A modern speaker would at best be able to pick out individual words here and there; the syntax was too archaic for real communication. Plus, my accent was shit. But this, oh this made the man react. He exclaimed in the same language as before and began speaking rapidly. I stood up, and he began gesturing with his hands. The horse raised its head from its grazing, its ears twitching as it took in the excitement in its master's voice. I looked beyond it, down the slope of a hill, and saw in the distance a dark blot of people and animals coming towards us. I shaded my eyes with my hand. I could see horses and camels and people atop them, but no vehicles—not even wagons. \"What is this?\" I asked. The man gestured towards the group of people and animals, and spoke some, but of course I didn't understand him. \"Is this a—a ritual procession of some kind? A funeral?\" I couldn't think of a better guess as to why the people had no vehicles. The man's lack of comprehension or even recognition of English said that I was somewhere very far away from the UPenn campus, and the camels made me doubt it was anywhere in North America, South America, or Europe. The man gestured towards the procession and took a few steps down the hill towards it. He looked at me and made something similar to a beckoning gesture. When I took a step towards him, he took another step towards the procession. I took a step, and that seemed to satisfy him that I was indeed going to follow. He turned to his horse, swung himself into the saddle, and then set off at a walking pace down the hill. I followed. I had no idea what kind of people were in the procession, or what their goal was or where they were going. Looking back, I'm appalled by how naïve and trusting I was; they could have been slavers, bandits, or even just dishonorable people who weren't above raping and robbing a lone, defenseless woman they found in the wilderness, and I just followed the first person I saw right up to them . Disgusting. My train of thought as I followed the man was little more than annoyance at the fact that he hadn't offered to let me ride behind him on his horse, and was instead making me walk beside the animal. We approached the procession. Several people called out in the same language that the man had used to speak to me. He called back. A person on camelback lashed the flank of their mount with a riding crop, making the animal turn around and engage in the most awkward run I had ever seen towards the back of the group. By the time I was close enough to smell the sweat and general bodily stink of perhaps a hundred people and beasts traveling under the hot sun, the person on the camel returned with two others in tow: one was a man wearing a black robe and headdress riding a white horse, and the other was an older man with a white robe and orange headdress mounted on a dark brown horse. These people called out to my escort, who called back to them, who left the general body of the procession and came towards us. The man in the white robe dismounted and approached me. He stopped a little more than an arm's length away, put a hand over his heart, and then said a phrase I recognized: \" As-salāmu 'alaykum .\" I knew the proper reply, but didn't trust myself to pronounce it correctly. In Greek, I said: \"And peace be upon you as well.\" Had I really been unable to recognize Arabic this entire time? \"Who are you?\" the man asked, \"And what are you doing in this place?\" His Greek was much more fluid than mine, and (wonder of wonders) the same style. I guess classical scholars weren't as uncommon as I'd thought back in UPenn. \"My name is Ashley Briggs. I was attacked in the night—\" I had no idea how to say 'hit by a car' in 2400-year-old Greek, \"—and awoke only when this man found me on the hillside over there. Could you please tell me where I am, sir?\" \"You are in the territory of the Oghuz Turks. I am saddened to hear that you were attacked. Do you require medical aid?\" \"No, but I thank you.\" \"Do you know where your husband might be?\" \"I am not married, sir.\" \"What of your father?\" \"He is… far away. I left home to study the classics—with his permission, of course.\" I'd been introduced to Fatima's parents over Skype and had a decent grasp of how to talk to Muslim men. \"So that is how you speak the classical tongue! It is rare beyond measure to find a woman so educated. Do you have an escort?\" \"No, sir.\" His eyebrows rose. His younger companion interjected with something impatient and Arabic. The man responded calmly in the same language before turning back to me. \"Forgive me. My name is Melchisidek, son of Abimelech, son of Chileab. My young friend is Ahmed, son of Fahdlan, son of Rashid. We are diplomats sent by al-Muqtadir bi-llāh, the great caliph of Baghdad, to the king of the Volga Bulgars. We travel there now.\" Baghdad—so, Iraq. I had barely any interest in modern politics and wasn't sure who the current ruler there was, but I was pretty damn sure that Bulgaria was nowhere near the Volga river, which was in the middle of Russia (1). These people were either insane or part of some scheme I was in no way prepared to take on. Had I stumbled across a cult? Unfortunately, they were the only people within sight, and I wasn't keen on wandering through Turkey or wherever this place was until I found someone more sane. I felt my stomach knotting in anxiety, but managed to take a deep breath and ask: \"If it is agreeable to you, sir, I would like to stay with you for a time—just until I have the means to return home. Please. I—I do not want to lost here.\" Melchisidek did not answer right away, but instead asked: \"What faith do you keep?\" \"I am a Christian, sir.\" Technically. I was baptized and confirmed under St. Jerome (2) per my grandmother's wishes, but as soon as she'd passed away during my adolescence I'd stopped attending church and devolved into a disinterested agnostic—but a possibly-crazy Muslim wouldn't be interested in hearing all that. \"Then it would gladden our hearts to provide you with aught that you need,\" Melchisidek said. He must have seen the surprised look on my face, because he smiled and continued: \"Though it was through Ismail's line that the prophet Muhammad was born, and through Isaac's Iesus Christ, were they not both the sons of Abraham? In the land of the godless barbarian Oghuz, it is proper for us to provide aid to one another.\" Well, that was… religious. And bigoted. But it meant that Melchisidek was willing to help me, so I wasn't going to complain. He turned and said something to Ahmed, who called out to two men riding double on a mule waiting some distance away. They approached and spoke to him, and seemed to be disagreeing with him. Ahmed's tone become more insistent, and with scowls and grumbling they both dismounted. \"Can you ride?\" Melchisidek asked. \"Uh… no,\" I answered. \"Then today is the day you shall learn,\" Melchisidek said far too serenely. The mule must have easily weighed more than 1000 lbs—and it was supposed to obey me just because I was tugging on some ropes attached to its head? Ridiculous. Give me a car or even a bicycle any day. One of the men riding the mule led it over, now wearing a glare that was directed straight at me. His companion, still standing where they had dismounted, had kept his scowl with his arms folded across his chest. Melchisidek saw me looking at them and spoke loudly and sharply in Arabic. Instantly, their faces smoothed into masks of disinterested neutrality, and the one not holding the mule's reins jogged back to the body of the caravan and disappeared into the mass of people and animals. \"I apologize for the discourtesy of our slaves,\" Melchisidek said. Slaves? This man was keeping people enslaved ? What if he tried to enslave me ? (The fear was illogical: Melchisidek had just accepted my request to allow me to travel with him, and had treated me with nothing but generosity and courtesy. But I'm African-American; my skin is as dark as the coffee beans my ancestors had been forced to plant and harvest on plantations in the Caribbean. Hatred/terror of being held in bondage might as well be imprinted in my DNA). While I was caught in that internal spiral of shock/revulsion/fear, the slave not attending to the mule had returned with a folded pile of cloth. He presented it to Melchisidek, who nodded, and then brought it to me. \"Please accept this burqha , to guard your modesty from the gaze of dishonorable men and the wanton Oghuz,\" Melchisidek said. His tone and wording made it sound like I was being given a gift, but from the expectant look on his face and those of the slaves it felt like an order. I took the burqha and unfolded it. It was a plain black robe with long sleeves whose hem reached a little past my ankles, with both a hood and a covering for the lower face. Over the portion where my eyes were supposed to be there was a fine, loose mesh. I took off my backpack and put it on. As soon as I had everything adjusted into the proper position and was peering out at the world through the mesh, I noticed that Melchisdek, Ahmed, and the slaves were actually looking at me now. Previously, they had stared past me and refused to make eye contact. Now, covered with the burqha , I was apparently safe to look at. \"Thank you, sir,\" I said, and Melchisidek dipped his head in acknowledgement. I shrugged my backpack's straps back over my shoulders, and the slave leading the mule walked up to me. I had to hike up the burqha 's hem to be able to set my foot in the stirrup (which made the men all pointedly look elsewhere) but the mule didn't seem alarmed when I swung myself up to sit on its back. Melchisidek, however, tsk ed in disapproval. \"You cannot sit that way, daughter of Briggs,\" he chided. \"It is more modest to sit sideways in the saddle, and will also preserve you from the soreness of riding.\" Because God forbid a man see me with spread legs, since they're animals with no sense of self-control. First the burqha , and now this. My inner feminist was seething. But both the mule and the burqha itself were gifts given to me out of nothing more than Melchisidek's own altruism; I couldn't refuse this request without disgracing both him and myself. Very, very, very carefully I stood up in the saddle, swaying dangerously for a moment as the mule shifted its footing, and then turned so that I could sit sideways. I smoothed down the burqha 's skirt so that it covered my legs down to the ankles, and became safe to look at once more. Melchisidek walked his horse over to me and took the mule's reins, then kept hold of them as he spurred his mount into first a trot, and then a canter as we hurried to rejoin the stragglers of the procession. The mule didn't have handlebars or even a seatbelt; the most I could do was cling to the edge of the saddle with my fingers and keep my teeth gritted tight to stop from whimpering. I could feel the animal's muscles moving underneath me and hear its labored breathing. It had four legs that moved and interacted with each other rather than four wheels that remained solidly apart in their separate corners. What if the animal stumbled or tripped? What if it fell with me on top of it? What if it fell on top of me ? I felt nauseous—and damn all propriety, but sidesaddle was the most insecure position ever dreamed of for sitting on a equine's back. I was going to fall. I was going to fall. I was going to f— We reached the main body of the procession and slowed down, which let me remember how to breathe and reminded me to loosen my death-grip on the saddle's edge before my hands started to cramp. \"Are you well, daughter of Briggs?\" Melchisidek asked. \"Y-Yes, sir,\" I said. \"I have never gone so fast before on an animal's back.\" We likely hadn't broken, what, 20 mph? But it was so different than going in a vehicle, even though I was used to doing 60 mph on the highway back home, that it had seemed frightening. I also hadn't had an ounce of control through the entire experience. Melchisidek smiled, though it didn't seem mocking. The front of the procession had halted, and the rest of it was slowly following suit like a line of cars piling up bumper to bumper at a red light. \"May I ask why we have stopped?\" Melchisidek shaded his eyes with his hand and peered ahead. \"Our leader, Sousan al-Rasi, is speaking to Kudarkin.\" \"Who is Kudarkin?\" \"He is the subordinate of the chief of this tribe of the Oghuz. We must ask his permission to travel through their land.\" Eventually, permission was given, and the procession carried on at a walking place. Donkeys brayed, camels groaned, and men cursed both in loud Arabic. The sun beat down and made me sweat under the burqha as it slid down towards the west. There was nothing to do except sit on the mule's back and watch the scenery go by, of which there was little: the steppe was hilly, but had no trees, settlements, rivers, or even rock formations. The only interesting things that occurred were when some of the Arab travelers took the hoods off the raptors they traveled with (aside from servants/slaves, it must have been a party largely made up of noblemen) and let the birds loose to hunt rabbits in the long grass. Occasionally one flew back with a kill. The two slaves who had given up the mule for me had no choice but to follow behind our mounts, mostly walking but jogging a few paces once in a while in order to keep up. Sweat gleamed on their faces and darkened the underarms of their undyed robes. They did not look happy. I felt guilty, but neither wanted to walk myself nor knew how to approach Melchisidek in regards to changing the situation. At last, I could stand the boredom no longer and began pestering Melchisidek with questions—largely about the Oghuz, but I also tried to be sneaky and ask a few broader ones about the rest of the world. He answered patiently and with the appearance of honesty, but his responses were… troubling. He talked of how the Byzantine Empire had recently made war upon the caliphate ruling Baghdad, of the Holy Roman Empire that had risen from the ashes of Charlemagne's rule of Frankia/Germania, and of how the Iberian peninsula was flourishing under Muslim rule. I remembered enough from high school to know that the Byzantine Empire was conquered by Muslim forces at the beginning of the Renaissance and became the Ottoman Empire, but couldn't pin even a broad handful of centuries on the other details he mentioned. \"What is the year?\" I asked. \"310,\" Melchisidek answered. That didn't make sense. It was true that post-Classical history wasn't one of my strong points, but I knew that the final collapse of the Roman Empire was roughly 450—which didn't leave a lot of room for all these other political powers. \"In Islam,\" Melchisidek said, \"We count our years starting after the Prophet's journey from Mecca to Medina, called the hijri . That would be the 622nd year after the death of Iesus.\" \"So that would put the date at… 932 AD (3) , smack in the middle of the Dark Ages. That made more sense than the year being 310 AD, but it was still wrong by more than a millennia. What kind of fantasy world were Melchisidek and the rest of these travelers living in? Finding myself stranded in Turkey I could (reluctantly) accept, but time travel ? Ludicrous. Still. Melchisidek's knowledge of \"contemporary\" politics was expansive and detailed. Maybe this was a troop of reenactors who were just really dedicated to staying in-character. I could play along to avoid offending him, and we would eventually reach a city or town and there part ways. That seemed good. I wasn't ready to face the truth. The conversation turned to geography, since I wanted to know where exactly in the Anatolian peninsula we were located (as it turned out, not at all: the Oghuz Turks claimed the land between the Caspian and Aral seas, which corresponds with modern Kazakhstan, and Turkey as I knew it was inhabited by the Khazar Khaganate). We moved on to Strabo and Pytheas, two Greek writers/geographers whose texts I happened to be familiar with. Melchisidek had been polite and informative when discussing what he was pretending to view as the present, but he truly came alive when our discussion focused on the ancient writers. He grew animated and gestured with his hands, explaining the parallels between the Muslim and Hellenic world in ways that I found fascinating , from language to clothing to art. Here is a fact that is especially pertinent, which I hadn't concluded on my own: both the Hellenic and Muslim worlds hold women to similar same standards of modesty—married or unmarried, respectable women do not leave their father's/husband's house if they can help it, and go veiled in public if they are required to do so. In my mind, the burqha transformed from a misogynistic burden into more of a learning experience: to see the world as a Hellenic woman would! \"But do Muslim women have the Heraia Olympia?\" I asked, referring to the women-only section of the Ancient Greek Olympics. It was held prior to the men's competition, which women could not even attend as spectators; the penalty for attempting to so much as watch the games was death, traditionally via being thrown off a cliff. \"No,\" Melchisidek answered. \"But we have no Olympic games, either. The Greeks were a vain people, and showed their nakedness in the gymnasiums of their cities as they sought physical perfection. Perhaps they would not have fallen from power if they had devoted themselves to prayer instead.\" Then, however, he smiled. \"Truly, I have enjoyed our conversation today, daughter of Briggs. By Allah's grace you have overcome the weakness of mind common to your sex and made yourself into a respectable scholar. I feel fortunate to have met you.\" I was grateful for the way the burqha hid my face. Weakness of mind? It was one thing to keep yourself in-character for a performance, but quite another to outright insult—I can feel myself getting angry again, even hours later as I write down the occurrence. \"You are very kind, sir,\" I gritted out. We carried on for the rest of the day, and came upon the encampment of Etrek ibn-al-Qatagan, the headman of the tribe of the Oghuz who had agreed to be our host. CHAPTER NOTES: (1) Bulgars (the ethnic group that would eventually found modern Bulgaria) created their own state along the banks of the Volga river, which existed between the 7th and 13th centuries before being destroyed by the rising Mongol Empire c. 1241. In the year that this story is taking place, their leader, Almış, had recently converted to Islam. Melchisidek and Ahmed are traveling to his court to provide religious guidance as well as strengthen the political ties between Volga Bulgaria and Baghdad. (2) St. Jerome is the patron of librarians, archivists, and translators, and his feast day is September 30th. (3) Ashley's reckoning of the date is inaccurate, since the Islamic lunar year doesn't correspond exactly to the Gregorian (Christian) calendar. The year of Ahmed ibn Fahdlan's journey to the Volga Bulgars is actually 922 CE, but the difference is minute enough that I only mention it here for posterity's sake.[Chapter 2] Etrek ibn al-Qatagan was a Muslim, unlike the majority of Oghuz who worshipped the Göktanrı (literally \"sky god\"), and he spoke with Sousan al-Rasi and Ahmed. I hung back with Melchisidek, who apparently had status of his own connected to Ahmed's father but, among foreigners, felt no shame in indulging his eccentricities. Rather than going to speak to the headman, Melchisidek preferred to stay with me and watch as al-Qatagan's servants erected Turkish-style felt tents for the noblemen of the procession (servants and slaves would have to find their own accommodation). They also herded sheep and goats into a nearby pen so that they could be slaughtered in accordance with Islamic dietary law. \"How long will we stay here?\" I asked. \"Only as long as courtesy requires. It is best if you do not speak to the Oghuz, daughter of Briggs; they are lustful and callous, and very few know the grace of Allah.\" \"As you wish, sir,\" I said. I was apparently the only woman in the procession, and had been getting glances from some of al-Qatagan's servants. They couldn't see much of me thanks to the burqha , but even with a barrier, being subject to their gaze felt… uncomfortable. Did they think I was a slave or concubine? We dismounted when our tent was ready, and the two slaves led our mounts away. One of them growled something angry and probably rude to me in Arabic, too low for Melchisidek to hear, as he took the mule's reins. I pretended not to notice. Either Ahmed and Melchisidek were persons of some importance in the ambassadorial procession, or else Etrek ibn-al-Qatagan was an extremely generous host, because the tent was (for something erected and fully furnished in under an hour) amazing. It was quite spacious, about twice the size of my freshman dorm room at UPenn, and the floor and curved walls were covered with thick, patterned rugs. There was a bronze brazier under the central smokehole, and two raised platforms covered with what looked like bedding. Melchisidek indicated a corner that I initially thought was part of the wall, but the patterned cloth there turned out to be a curtain. Beyond it was a small area not much bigger than a walk-in closet, with another bedding-covered platform. Underneath it was a ceramic chamberpot. There was nothing else. I heard Ahmed return and speak to Melchisidek outside the tent. A few minutes later, the older man returned. \"You will stay here,\" he said, gesturing to the little nook that was apparently mine, \"And the slaves will prepare a supper for you. Ibn Fahdlan and I will dine with the Oghuz leaders tonight. Do you require any accouterments for your prayers?\" The last part took me by surprise. I thanked him but refused, and wished him well. Melchisidek took his leave after grabbing his prayer rug, and I heard him, Ahmed, and the rest of the procession chanting their evening prayers to Allah before going to eat. It was now a little after sunset. I could see the bright lights of cookfires stretching in all directions, their smoke giving off a pungent reek. (There were few trees on the steppe, and later I learned they burned camel and horse dung for fuel). The encampment must have covered several square miles. All around me, men went about their evening's business, a few casting me more of those curious glances as I stood in the doorway of the tent. One of Melchisidek's slaves came up to me, said something in an irritated tone of voice, and made a shooing gesture with both hands towards the interior of the tent. The other one was kneeling in front of a nearby fire and stirring a wide but shallow pot suspended over it. He glared at me over his shoulder before returning to his task. I pointed to the brazier inside the tent. \"How do I light that?\" I asked in Greek, even though I knew it was useless. \" Ignis? Lux? \" I tried in my limited Latin, but neither word changed the slave's scowl. Pointing at it again and speaking in a more angry, urgent voice stirred him, however. He fetched some dried dung and lit the pungent mess with a long splinter from his companion's cookfire. The flames spread across the fuel in the brazier, low and sullen and stinking. I huddled as close as I could while breathing through my mouth, and opened my backpack. Beowulf was the first thing I saw. I was looking for something with which to pass the time until Melchisidek returned, and the silver lettering on the otherwise-plain cover glittered in the firelight. I hesitated, then realized that I truly did have nothing better to do, and pulled out the book. I flipped through the introduction (it was only a story about a hero slaying a monster, after all, not a historical text—who needed an introduction for that?), found the first page, and started reading: LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped, we have heard, and what honor the athelings won! Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes, from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore, awing the earls. Since erst he lay friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him: for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve, till before him the folk, both far and near, who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate, gave him gifts: a good king he! (1) I closed the book. There were no notes explaining what an atheling was, or a welkin, or even a whale-path. (That last was especially confusing—was he talking about whale migration routes? But how would a Danish person from the Dark Ages know about that?) and everything around me was strange and uncertain and so, so fragile; I was only here, reading by firelight and having supper prepared for me, because of a stranger's apparent altruism. I didn't want a book that strayed so far from my comfort zone. I put Beowulf back and pulled out Thucydides' History , which was by now an old friend. I had read it many times, to learn about both the language and the time period it was written in, and felt comfortable skipping the introduction here too—but this time out of familiarity, not arrogance. I started on chapter two: The city of Epidamnus stands on the right of the entrance of the Ionic Gulf. Its vicinity is inhabited by the Taulantians, an Illyrian people. The place is a colony from Corcyra, founded by Phalius, son of Eratocleides, of the family of the Heraclids, who had according to ancient usage been summoned for the purpose from Corinth, the mother country. The colonists were joined by some Corinthians, and others of the Dorian race. Now, as time went on, the city of Epidamnus became great and populous; but falling prey to factions arising, it is said, from a war with her neighbors the barbarians, she became much enfeebled, and lost a considerable amount of her power. (2) You see the difference between the two texts? Beowulf is an epic poem about a folk hero fighting monsters, while the History is (obviously) a historical account. It was clean and straightforward, devoid of confusing words, metaphors, and whale migration routes. I settled into Thucydides' pedantic style, letting the language and familiar Greek names and places soothe me. I even managed to forget about the smell of burning dung, and was only roused from the book when one of the slaves loudly cleared his throat behind me. I startled, looking up with wide eyes, and saw the slave bearing a shallow dish filled with… something. Later on, I learned that the Oghuz called this particular food kuurdak , and made it by cooking sheep organs (liver, lungs, kidneys) with onions. But the Arab slaves had made it here, and it smelled good, so I returned the History to my backpack and took the dish. Once both slaves were outside again I removed the burqha to expose my mouth to eat. I had no knife or fork and so ate with my fingers once the food was cool enough to touch without burning myself. The meat was chewy and not very thoroughly cooked, and the onions had a satisfying crunch that suggested they hadn't been cooked very long either. I should have been more wary of that, but I was hungry and still as trusting as a child. There was no seasoning: pepper was apparently an exotic spice that the Arabs had brought only to give as peace-gifts to the chieftains of whatever ethnic groups they encountered, and salt a precious commodity so far inland. I ate. I started to feel queasy about halfway through the meal, but I shrugged it off as either eating too fast or else piling rich food into an otherwise empty stomach, and when I finished as much as I could I returned the dish to the slaves and went back to my reading. Five minutes later, there were deep, clenching pains in my belly and I had an urgent need to use the restroom. I asked the slaves where the toilets were, but of course they didn't understand me. My emergency was great enough that I retreated into my curtained nook and used the chamberpot. And then realized that there was no toilet paper. I had nothing to wipe myself with. I felt a moment of panic, but then scrabbled for the ends of the carpets that covered the tent's floor, pulling one back and exposing a patch of short, withered grass. I grabbed a handful and used that instead. I was ashamed and disgusted, but at least had privacy. And then I needed to use the chamberpot a second time. And a third time. And finally the pain in my stomach grew great enough that I vomited as well, but that did little to ease it. Worse, the chamberpot was now full to the brim of vomit and feces, and I had no idea what to do with it. The wave of my body purging itself passed, and I was left gasping and shaking with my jeans around my ankles. I was weak and still very sick, and the air in my tiny refuge was heavy with the stench of bodily waste. Breathing it was making my stomach roil even worse, but the chamberpot was full and I had no idea what to do. I felt another wave of sickness approaching. Inspiration or else desperation struck me, but either way I pulled up my panties and jeans, grabbed the full chamberpot, and left the small space that had been assigned to me. I hurried over to the slaves and left the full pot sitting next to them (which made me feel ashamed, because I did not want them to even see the disgusting evidence of my illness, much less be forced to deal with it), and then grabbed the clean, empty chamberpots from underneath Ahmed's and Melchisidek's sleeping platforms. I turned around to go back and be sick in curtained privacy, but as I did so I saw the slaves looking at me. I looked back at them, and they returned my gaze. They looked at my naked face . They looked at me, shaking and sick and on the verge of vomiting on the carpets right in front of them, and there was a cruel satisfaction in their eyes. They had deliberately undercooked my food. They had wanted this to happen to me. Tears of humiliation were pricking at the corners of my eyes, but there was nothing I could do except hurry back behind the curtain and commence being sick. I knew they could hear me outside, and anyone passing close by to the tent could hear me as well. The worst was when I was retching into one chamberpot as my bowels betrayed me into the other, but I was helpless to stop either from happening and could only endure it until it passed. I left my shelter long enough to deliver the two full chamberpots to the slaves (whom I no longer felt guilty about forcing to deal with the aftermath of my sickness), and then collapsed onto the sleeping platform. The night air on the steppe was cold, and the brazier's warmth was several meters away and further separated by the curtain. I was sweating anyway, and I could feel the moisture now cooling on my skin as I lay there, dehydrated and weak and trembling. I wanted to cry. I wanted to go home, or at least back to my suite in Harnwell House with its flushable toilets, toilet paper, and sympathetic but above all female roommates with whom I shared a common language. They would make me tea and politely refrain from throwing me through time and space to the medieval era of Central Asia. I thought of Summer then, but was too exhausted to properly hate her for what she had done to me. But in those moments, lying on the hard sleeping platform and staring up at the tent's darkened ceiling, breathing in the lingering stench of my own feces and vomit, I accepted the truth: I was no longer in the 21st century. The evidence was too damning to support any other conclusion, and I was too beaten down to keep lying to myself. I couldn't even believe that this was all some sort of dream or hallucination—this bout of food poisoning was so intensely and miserably physical that it could be nothing other than reality. I had just enough energy to have these thoughts, and then I wrapped myself in the sheepskins the Oghuz had provided as bedding, and I slept. CHAPTER NOTES: (1) translated by Francis Barton Grummere (2) translated by Richard Crawley[Chapter 3] I was awoken by the sounds of crying and pleading. My first, foggy thought as I disentangled myself from sleep was that someone was beating a yelping dog nearby, which made me lurch upright off the sleeping platform and stumble out from behind the curtain without bothering to so much as put on my shoes. I squinted in the sunlight that streamed through the tent's doorway, then saw that it wasn't a dog being beaten. It was one of the slaves. Ahmed was berating the man in loud, angry Arabic and raining blows on his head and shoulders with a riding crop. The slave was doing nothing to fight back, only crouching down with his arms over his head as he cried out in pain, protest, or both. The other slave was standing nearby, watching helplessly. \"Stop this right now!\" I said, forgetting myself and speaking in English. \"Daughter of Briggs!\" Melchisidek said, \"You are unclothed!\" Nonsense. I was wearing a tee-shirt and jeans. Sure, they were rumpled and smelled terrible after last night's ordeal, but then everything smelled terrible—the dung-scented smoke of the cookfires had settled into everything, and no amount of nonexistent perfume could cover it up. Eventually you got used to it and stopped noticing. \"This needs to stop!\" I said in Greek. \"Tell your friend to stop!\" \"The slave is being disciplined. Please, daughter of Briggs, you must clothe yourself against the eyes of—\" I grabbed the riding crop out of Ahmed's hand. He was so startled by my interference that he made no effort to recover it, only stared at me. I glared back at him. The slave, bleeding from several wounds to his scalp and face, crawled towards his companion. \"Don't you dare strike that man again,\" I said. Ahmed might not have been able to understand my words, but my tone was clear enough. He narrowed his eyes and snapped something in angry, affronted Arabic to Melchisidek. \"Daughter of Briggs,\" the older man sighed, \"Please return to the tent.\" \"Why were you hurting that man?\" I demanded. \"Because he shamed you, and through you, us. A slave who poisons the food of his masters' guests cannot be trusted. He will be disciplined and then sold.\" \"The food wasn't poisoned, just undercooked.\" \"Nevertheless, daughter of Briggs.\" \"I'm certain it was an accident,\" I lied. \"He came with you from Baghdad, yes? So he wouldn't be used to cooking food in the way of the Oghuz. It was a simple error, and will not happen again.\" Melchisidek was not just refusing to make eye contact as we spoke, but was avoiding looking at me altogether. The tee-shirt and jeans clung to my body in a way I hadn't really thought of before being made to wear the burqha , outlining my thighs and hips and breasts and every other part of me that these Muslim men considered immodest. Ahmed, now that he had recovered from his surprise, had joined Melchisidek in refusing to look at me. But other men in the camp were doing the exact opposite; some had even stopped whatever they were doing in order to take advantage of the opportunity to look at an uncovered female. I could feel their gazes roving over me. I had to go back into the tent before I caused Melchisidek any more embarrassment. I offered the riding crop back to Ahmed, who took it with a frown (the slave was safely out of reach and having his wounds tended by his companion), and then went back inside. I paused a moment close to where Melchisidek was standing and murmured, \"I would speak with you in private, if I may.\" I ducked into my private little nook and pulled the burqha over my head, then adjusted it so that I was once more peering out at the world through the fine mesh that concealed my eyes. When I emerged, Melchisidek was waiting for me on a stool next to the now unlit brazier. I knelt next to him. \"I apologize for leaving the tent without covering myself.\" Melchisidek sighed in response and looked down at where he had folded his hands in his lap. I could see a few liver spots on the backs—was he truly that old? Did he see this expedition as one last adventure before living out his final days in the comfort of Baghdad? \"My father refused to keep slaves,\" I said slowly, thinking, \"Because he believed that… to take away someone's freedom and to treat them as property, to buy and sell them like cattle… is not the way Iesus Christ would want us to treat our fellow men. I know your customs are different, but when I saw the slave being disciplined I was overcome by emotion and thought only to stop his pain.\" \"So you do have a woman's weakness,\" Melchisidek said, but he sounded thoughtful rather than angry. \"Yes. But I like to think that it's of the heart, rather than of the mind.\" He smiled at that. \"Your father sounds like a man of singular morality.\" Not true—I loved my dad, but knew he was an ordinary person with vices as well as virtues. What distinguished him from Melchisidek was the fact that Jamison Briggs had a set of morals appropriate for an African-American man of the 21st century, and hating slavery was an aspect of that. \"Thank you,\" was all I could say, however. And then, after thinking a moment: \"If you still wish to sell the slave, I would like to buy him.\" \" You wish to buy Hamid?\" So that was his name. \"Yes,\" I said. \"And then I will manumit him, and give him what funds I can so that he may travel where he wills. I do not want him to be stranded here among a people whose language and customs are strange to him.\" I still had the candles, chalk, and frankincense in my backpack. I wasn't sure how much they were worth, but I knew that frankincense was a luxury item and what I had was probably of much higher quality than what could be obtained in this area. Melchisidek laughed. It was not mocking, just a burst of surprised delight. \"Truly, daughter of Briggs, you have a generous and charitable soul! Did your father teach you this?\" \"Yes, and my mother as well.\" He waved a hand, as though a mother's role in her child's upbringing was minute and not worth mentioning. \"I do not wish to deplete your funds through the sale of Hamid. He will remain with us and receive no further punishment for his impudence—on the condition that it never happens again. Is this acceptable, daughter of Briggs?\" \"Yes, sir. Thank you.\" I saw Ahmed as I rose to return to my curtained nook. He had watched the exchange in silence with an unreadable expression on his face. What would he have thought of the conversation if he'd been able to understand it? Would he have seen Melchisidek as being too lenient with me? I knew I had been lucky to meet him—not just because he spoke Greek, but because he was such a kind and generous man; he could have turned the tables and ordered his two slaves to beat me to death for appearing in public without wearing the burqha , but had instead chosen to ignore the indiscretion. He'd even humored me and cut short Hamid's punishment. Maybe he had daughters at home, and indulged them the same way he was now indulging me. He seemed like the type of person to keep a female infant, rather than drowning her or leaving her to die of exposure the way the Greeks (and perhaps also Arabs) did, since they saw girl-children as nothing but a waste of family resources. These thoughts mulled around in my brain as I removed the burqha and crawled under the sheepskins on the sleeping platform. I was still tired from last night's ordeal, and felt weak and dehydrated. Since food wasn't readily available, sleep seemed like a good idea. I woke sometime in late afternoon to the sound of Ahmed, Melchisidek, and the slaves chanting their prayers. I felt a little bit better, but also desperately thirsty, and left my curtained space after donning the burqha . After finishing their prayers, Ahmed and Melchisidek rolled up their prayer rugs and gave them to one of the slaves, who brought them back inside the tent. He stopped in front of me, gave a slight bow, and said, \" Ba'tezer begadd. Makanš el-mafrūḍ a'mel kedah .\" I had no idea what he said. I pointed to him, though, and asked, \"Hamid?\" He gave a tiny smile and shook his head. He pointed to himself and said, \"Ibrahim,\" then to the other slave who was taking a turn tending to the cookfire: \"Hamid.\" The slave turned at the sound of his name, and I saw the scabbed-over wounds on his face. He gave me a watery, rather nervous-looking smile and then returned to his task, and the other slave put the prayer rugs away. I stopped him on his way back out of the tent and mimed drinking from a cup. He nodded, apparently understanding, and went on his way. I approached Melchisidek, who had brought his stool outside and was watching the activity of the encampment. People went by leading horses, mules, or camels, typically with the animals piled high with sacks and boxes whose contents I couldn't guess. It was easy to tell the Oghuz from the Arabs: the Arabs all wore long robes and cloths wrapped around their heads (later, I learned such cloths were called keffiyeh ), while the Oghuz showed more variety and differed between pants and robes, and often also wore furs as well. \"Ibrahim spoke to me, sir,\" I said, after sitting in silence with Melchisidek for a while. \"What did he say?\" I repeated the phrase as best I could, and after several moments of thought Melchisidek translated for me: \"He said 'I sincerely apologize. I shouldn't have done it.'\" \"And how do I thank him?\" \"There is no need.\" \"But I would like to.\" \"Then say šukran .\" \" Šukran .\" (1) Melchisidek smiled. Ibrahim returned with two cups of liquid, one for Melchisidek and one for myself. I sipped it, discovered it was tea, and was about to drain the cup in two gulps before realizing that doing so was probably impolite. I used my newly-learned word on Ibrahim, who smiled, and then continued my conversation with Melchisidek as the sun sank towards the west. He and Ahmed would dine with the Oghuz leaders again, and there would be exchanges of gifts and other courtesies. For politeness' sake the ambassadorial procession would remain in al-Qatagan's camp for three more days, and then we would head north, towards the upper coast of the Caspian Sea, and follow the river Volga until we reached the Bulgars. \"And then what?\" I asked. \"After our duties are finished we shall return home, to Baghdad.\" I nodded and looked away from Melchisidek, turning my gaze towards the alleys between the tents of the encampment without truly seeing them. Home. But Baghdad wasn't my home. I wasn't sure how I had arrived in this time and place to begin with, let alone how to return to UPenn in 2018. Oh, I had some vague ideas about Summer and the \"magical\" supplies, but nothing resembling a solid theory. It could just as easily have been some completely other thing—an act of God, even, though that raised theological implications that I was neither ready nor willing to dwell on. Regardless, I had no clear plan of what I was supposed to do if I couldn't return home. It was possible (though far from certain) that Melchisidek would be willing to continue supporting me and to accept me into his household in Baghdad. I could learn Arabic, perhaps convert to Islam for the sake of my host, and continue my scholarly pursuits—simply by speaking to me, he demonstrated that Arab culture respected classical scholars. That would be a good life. But, like all unmarried women in the Islamic world, I was a drain on my provider's resources—and Melchisidek was old; even if he was willing and wealthy enough to indulge a female scholar, I had no idea how his male heirs might feel. My only other \"plan\", which was really just a vague notion, was committing myself to a Christian convent. The nearest bastion of Christianity was the Byzantine Empire, which was Eastern Orthodox, and they said their Mass in Greek rather than Latin—which was the exact opposite of a problem for me. Spending the rest of my days copying religious texts in a scriptorium, or even tending gardens and singing psalms, weren't among my ambitions, but it would be a sheltered and perhaps even comfortable life. I was so absorbed in my gloomy contemplation of different futures for myself that it took me a while to notice the woman coming through the camp towards us. She was clearly one of the Oghuz: for one thing, I was the only woman who traveled with the Arabs, and for another she wore a fur robe that left her face exposed. She was old, and walked with the aid of a crooked stick, and her boots were made of dyed red and orange leather. She approached us directly, or rather me, and stopped a few paces away. \"You are the Greek woman?\" she demanded. It took me several moments to understand what she was saying. Her accent wasn't the Attic type (2) like mine and Melchisidek's, and she only had five or six teeth left—and two of them were black and rotting. \"Yes,\" I said, \"I speak that language.\" \"My mistress is Nafisa, wife of Etrek ibn-al-Qatagan. She would eat with you. Come.\" Melchisidek, perhaps insulted that he hadn't been addressed first, held out a hand to stop me from getting up. \"What does al-Qatagan's wife need?\" he asked. \"Conversation,\" the old woman said. \"News of the world. Companionship. Womanly things.\" Melchisidek nodded, looking uneasy, and addressed me with: \"Hamid will accompany you.\" He turned away and spoke in Arabic with the slave in question, who stood from where he had been squatting next to the fire. He brushed dirt off his robe with his hands and came to stand next to me. And with that, I had no choice except to accompany the old woman through the camp. We drew a few glances as we progressed through the Arab portion of the camp. I was apparently the source of some amount of gossip, either for being the strange lost woman that Melchisidek chose to take in or else for my display earlier that day. Even though I was wearing the burqha and so was shielded from their eyes, Hamid kept close, using his body as a barrier to prevent them looking at me. The old woman walked at my side, blithely unconcerned. Once we left the Arab sector and were among the Oghuz, the staring lessened. There were more women here, wives and slaves and concubines who clothed themselves as richly as their station afforded. Wealthy women wore wolf pelts and fabrics dyed in bright colors, while poorer ones had sheep- or horse-skins and undyed fabrics. There were men too, walking or riding about their business, and children and dogs were everywhere. The old woman was apparently known here: some people called out to her in the language of the Oghuz, to which she snapped out grumpy replies, and even warrior-looking men armed with bows and axes got out of her way. She was like Moses parting the sea, and Hamid and I could only follow in her wake. \"What is your name?\" I asked her. \"Athina,\" she answered. \"You are Greek?\" \"Thracian.\" Conversing with her was worse than pulling teeth. \"How did you come to live among the Oghuz?\" \"My daughter and I were captured by pirates, and we were sold first to the Khazars, and then to the Oghuz. Now I am here.\" \"What of your daughter?\" \"She was given to a the headman of a tribe to the north as a gift, to be his whore. Maybe she still is. Maybe she's dead.\" She glowered at the ground ahead of her, and the butt of her walking stick dug savagely into the turf with each step. I took the hint and changed the subject: \"What does Nafisa want with me?\" \"I told that man what she wanted. You heard.\" \"You can speak freely now; the slave doesn't understand Greek.\" \"My answer is the same.\" So much for that. Athina made no protest when I let the conversation die off into silence, and eventually we came to a tent. Most of the Oghuz dwellings had plain exteriors made from oiled leather panels that had been bleached to varying shades of not-quite-white by the sun, but this one… it was big, bigger even than the one that had been afforded to Melchisidek and Ahmed, and the exterior panels had been dyed a bright red. \"Nafisa is within. Your slave will not come with us,\" Athina said, and then pushed aside the leather curtain that served as a door. She entered. I held up a hand to stop Hamid from following, then did the same. The inside of the tent was well-lit; the flap covering the central smokehole had been opened, the fire in the brazier lit, and a cunning arrangement of smaller braziers and mirrors spread the light around. Patterned cloths covered the walls and floor, just as in Melchisidek and Ahmed's tent, but there were also plump cushions stuffed with wool and horsehair and low tables made of polished wood. It was a nomad's palace. And sitting on one of those cushions was its queen, the wife of Etrek ibn-al-Qatagan, a girl no older than fifteen. She grinned and said something in the Oghuz tongue. Athina translated: \"She greets you, and wants you to remove your covering.\" I took off the burqha . Nafisa's eyes widened, and then she spoke. Athina spoke to her in turn, then translated: \"She wanted to know why you are so dirty. I told her people from the south have darker flesh than ours. Go sit with her. I'll prepare a meal.\" I sank down onto one of the cushions next to Nafisa. She snatched up my hand and rubbed the back of it, apparently checking for dirt, and upon finding none she looked up at my face and then touched my nose. I frowned and swatted her hand away. \"What is she doing?\" I asked Athina. \"She has never seen a face like yours before.\" \"I can see that. But why—\" Nafisa said something. Athina translated: \"She wants to know if you are married, and how your husband desires you when you have thick lips and a flat nose.\" The old woman smiled then, showing off her rotting teeth. \"She thinks you're ugly.\" \"I'm not married, and where I come from a lot of people look like me. If everyone looks the same then nobody is ugly. Tell her that. And tell her that I think she is ugly.\" Athina snickered and translated, and Nafisa laughed. In truth, the girl wasn't ugly. She had a round face with dimples at the corners of her smiling mouth, as well as bright eyes and a little snub nose, and long hair braided into an elaborate coil at the back of her head. That hair was as black as raven feathers, and even had a bluish sheen to it in the light. Athina was cooking on the central brazier as we spoke, and when she went outside and came back with a platter of seasoned meat my stomach growled as saliva flooded my mouth. Nafisa giggled and said something. \"She wants to know if you're hungry.\" \"Yes. Extremely.\" Athina translated and went back to work. I questioned her as she did so, watching intently as she chopped the meat (it was horse) into small pieces, mixed them clumps of some whitish substance, and then wrapped them in dough. She explained she was making dumplings, which she called manti , and the whitish substance was actually tarhana , which was similar to dried cottage cheese. \"The Oghuz keep no fields, so all flour is bought from traders,\" Athina said. I took my cue and thanked Nafisa for treating me to such a lavish meal. Athina made tea as the dumplings boiled, and then we were served. There were no plates; Athina put the dumplings onto a ceramic platter and set it between us, and then retired to a cushion several feet away—close enough to easily translate, but not enough to intrude. I was hungry enough to immediately reach for a dumpling, but burned the tips of my fingers and retreated. Nafisa giggled again, but then her face became solemn. She started to speak. \"She wants to know why you came out of your tent today without your covering.\" So the gossip about me had spread among the Oghuz as well as the Arabs. \"Because I was angry at a slave being beaten, and forgot to put it on.\" \"Why were you angry?\" I gave Athina the same speech I had given Melchisidek. \"So you're a Christian?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then why travel with the Arabs?\" I explained how I had met Melchisidek, Ahmed, and the two slaves. Athina listened intently, then began translating. I snatched up a hot dumpling and juggled it from hand to hand, taking small bites. It tasted too good for me to care about burning my tongue. As Athina continued translating, Nafisa looked more and more unhappy. After several moments she interrupted with something angry-sounding and slapped the surface of a table in apparent frustration. Athina sighed and translated for me. \"She called you here because she was hoping there was a way for her to be a good Muslim bride for Etrek, but also not have to wear the covering. Now her hopes are spoiled.\" \"I'm… sorry to hear that.\" Athina shrugged. \"She had a pagan childhood and wants to stay as a child forever, riding horses through the hills. Now she's a woman and can't do that. If she had children she would forget and stop caring, but she doesn't, because Etrek ignores her.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he has other wives and better things to do.\" Nafisa stared at the platter of dumplings, eventually picking one up and slowly eating. All of the vibrant good humor she had demonstrated earlier had been sapped away, and she ate in morose silence. I tried to keep the conversation alive, inquiring about her married life and whether she had any activities she enjoyed, but even without Athina's curt translations it was clear Nafisa took no joy in talking to me. Eventually, I gave up and joined her in silently eating the dumplings. Nafisa's life was a sad one. She was fourteen, rather than fifteen the way I had guessed, and had been married to Etrek as part of a peace treaty between their two tribes. Forced to convert to Islam for the sake of the marriage, she was unused to the life of seclusion that Muslim women led and spent most of her days alone with only Athina for company. \"What about Etrek's other wives?\" I asked. Athina shook her head. \"As the newest and youngest wife, Nafisa is supposed to be...\" she trailed off, searching for the right word; apparently it had been a long time since she had spoken Greek, \"Subordinate to the others. But she wasn't. When Ayjan mocked her, she threw a stool at her.\" \"Ayjan is another wife?\" \"Yes. Etrek beat her for that, and now none of the others will spend time with her. You are her first visitor in... three and a half moons.\" Nafisa, hearing her name and that of a woman she hated, was watching us talk. I gave her a sympathetic look, which made Athina grunt disgustedly. \"Don't pity her,\" the old woman said, her voice unexpectedly hard. \"Nafisa does not work. She is never hungry, never thirsty. She sleeps on a soft bed and wears fine clothes. If she would only learn to be—\" Nafisa interrupted with something impatient and angry-sounding. Athina replied in a similar tone of voice, and for a minute or two the women argued in the Oghuz language. I, totally forgotten, could only watch and wait. Nafisa snapped out a final phrase and got to her feet, pulling on a pair of baggy pants under her dress. She started wrapping a long scarf over her hair and lower face. Athina offered a similar scarf to me. \"Cover yourself,\" she instructed. \"What is happpening?\" \"Nafisa has prepared a gift for you. She will show him to you now.\" \" Him ?\" I asked as I put on the scarf. When Athina didn't respond I continued: \"What kind of gift is this?\" \"A foolish one!\" was all Athina would say, however, and once Nafisa and I had concealed our hair and faces we exited the tent. Hamid was squatting next to the entrance. He looked up when the tent flap opened, and his eyes widened when he saw me and Nafisa barely bothering to cover ourselves. If he was angry at that, though, he didn't show it, and simply followed next to Athina as Nafisa led the way through the encampment. Several people looked at us as we went by, but none called out to Nafisa—perhaps because they didn't know her, or perhaps out of dislike. For all appearances Nafisa was oblivious to the other Oghuz, and we walked to the very edge of the encampment. Tents were sparser here, and generally smaller and poorer-looking than they had been closer to the center. Beyond them the grass had been clipped close to the turf and trampled by the passage of the tribe's herds of sheep, camels, and horses. Nafisa said something, and an Oghuz man lounging in front of a tent jumped to his feet and hurried away. He returned a few minutes later leading a small brown horse. \"Behold,\" Athina said, \"Your gift.\" \"I...\" I said, then trailed off. The horse looked... well, like a horse. I didn't know enough about them to offer much of an opinion. Its body was brown, but black between the knees and hooves of each leg, and its nose, mane, and tail were black as well. It didn't seem skinny or otherwise malnourished, and was standing there placidly enough wearing a bridle of braided leather. \"Well?\" Athina asked. \"I... I don't know how to ride,\" I said. \"Please tell her I appreciate the gift, but that I can't accept it.\" Athina gave me a long, unimpressed look. I had to resist the urge to look down and fidget. \"I will tell Nafisa,\" Athina said, \"That you cannot ride, but that you are elated at this opportunity to learn how.\" \"What? No, no, you can't—\" Athina was already translating, and I could only look on helplessly as Nafisa listened, then looked at me. The corners of her eyes crinkled up as she smiled beneath the scarf. My stomach twisted into knots as I smiled back. Nafisa dismissed the Oghuz man who had fetched the horse, then took hold of the reins, hiked up her dress, and swung herself into the saddle with an ease born from long experience. She beckoned to me, then coaxed me up onto the horse's back behind her. I wrapped my arms around her waist and tried not to squeeze too hard as she urged the horse to a walk, then to a bouncing trot that made me grit my teeth, and finally a smooth canter. It wasn't like riding the mule. Straddling the horse's back rather than sitting aidesaddle, I felt decently secure and in no danger of falling off. I could feel the muscles move beneath the animal's skin and hear its breathing become harder, but rather than just sullenly obeying the hands on its reins the horse seemed eager . It wanted to run with someone sitting on its back. It wanted to interact and feel the rider's commands. Nafisa whooped and did something with her knees, and the horse put its head down and broke into a run across the steppe. Nafisa laughed with joy and I did my best not to scream—but it was a good scream, the kind you let out when you're plummeting straight down on a rollercoaster track and are so excited there's no other sound you can possibly make. Nafisa turned the horse in a wide circle and made it slow down, and we arrived back at where Hamid and Athina were standing. Nafisa dismounted and helped me down, then babbled something bright and excited at me. \"She wants to know what you think.\" \"The horse is wonderful ,\" I said, surprising myself. The animal stood next to us, panting hard but with its head up and ears forward. It looked alert and intelligent in a way that my Honda back home never would, and seemed ready and willing to go again. \"What is its—I mean, his—name?\" Athina spoke with Nafisa, and the two went back and forth for several minutes. \"The horse has no name,\" Athina said eventually. At my confused look she continued: \"Etrek owns more than 4,000 horses. Do you think he names each and every one of them?\" \"Then how was Nafisa able to decide that she wanted to give me this horse? How could she tell that man earlier which one she wanted?\" More back-and-forth between Nafisa and Athina, and the Greek woman was getting impatient. \"The horse is called Dor ,\" Athina said at last. \"That is the name of the color of its hair. That's how the herdsmen distinguish him from other horses.\" Dor. What an interesting name. (3) \"And now he is yours,\" Athina said. CHAPTER NOTES (1) all Arabic translations from the arabicpod101 website, which I unfortunately cannot provide a link to. (2) an \"Attic\" accent means the accent of someone from Athens, which was the academic/cultural heart of Classical Greece. Well-educated foreigners (like Ashley and Melchisidek) who were taught to speak Greek would have learned to speak it with this accent. (3) \"Dor\" is a Turkmen word for the bay coat of a horse, and Turkmen itself is one of the languages of the eastern Oghuz. Nafisa and Ayjan are also Turkmen names.[Chapter 4] Melchisidek and Ahmed were surprised but far from displeased when I returned sitting (sidesaddle) on Dor's back. I hadn't thought of the little horse as anything other than a means of transportation—and possibly also portable currency, since I had seen no coins in use among the Oghuz and could fathom no other reason for al-Qatagan to own more than four thousand of the beasts—but the Arab diplomats saw the little horse as neither of those things. In their eyes, Dor was a political pawn, a highly visible mark of favor from the headman's wife. (I doubted that this \"mark of favor\" had been given with al-Qatagan's blessing beforehand, and could only hope that Nafisa wouldn't be punished for her generosity). Or at least, Melchisidek saw it that way. Ahmed just liked horses. After I dismounted and was standing a polite distance away, the younger Arab spent several minutes examining Dor, running his hands over the horse's back, neck, and legs and speaking to him in a gentle, soothing voice. Eventually, he turned back to me and said something. \"This is a good horse,\" Melchisidek translated. \"Not as good as our horses, which are the best in the world, but still good.\" \"'The best in the world?'\" I asked, raising an eyebrow. The expression was lost under the burqha , but my tone made the skepticism clear enough. Melchisidek began speaking to Ahmed, who shook his head and spoke in turn to the slaves. Ibrahim jogged away and returned leading Ahmed's white horse. \"This is a fine mare,\" Melchisidek began, \"Seven years of age with a coat as white as the clouds of Heaven. Look at the arch of her neck, her beautiful face, the carriage of her tail, even her prancing gait—her name, Mayyadah, means 'one who walks with pride and elegance'...\" It wasn't just Ahmed. I think all Arabs love horses to some degree. Even the slaves seemed to appreciate Mayyadah, stroking her nose and feeding her pieces of dried fruit when Ahmed wasn't looking. Melchisidek explained how the Arabs have been breeding horses for thousands of years, focusing on speed, endurance, and good temperament, and that some horses were so valuable as breeding stock that they were brought into their owners' homes in bad weather. But seeing Mayyadah and Dor standing side by side... it was like comparing a greyhound to a rottweiler. The white mare was composed of lean, graceful lines, every well-groomed inch of her shining with poise and attentiveness to her master, while my brown steppe-horse was a shaggy, muscular little animal that put back his ears and tried to nip the other horse's flank when she came too close. Dor lost some favor after that, and Ibrahim took him and Mayyadah back to where the white mare had been grazing with the other animals of the ambassadorial procession. Melchisidek continued telling me of Arab horses and horsemanship, even going so far as to speak of how the Prophet's mares had, while dying of thirst, turned away from water and came to their master's side at his call. That was the ideal of a true Arab horse, apparently: beautiful, graceful, strong, intelligent, swifter than the desert wind and more faithful than a dog. I listened politely as the sun grew ruddy and sank towards the west, but very little of the information was practical—especially for me, who knew almost nothing of horses to begin with. Finally , just after sunset, the mu'addhin (that is, the person appointed to dictate the call to prayer) sang out, and I retired to the interior of the tent as the slaves and diplomats alike spread their prayer rugs, knelt upon them, and bowed low in the direction of Mecca. The prayers were beautiful, though I didn't understand them. Later, I tried asking Melchisidek, with all discretion and politeness, just what he and the other Muslims said during their prayers—but the reply was so complicated that I don't trust myself to record his response with more than a cursory summary. What I understood is this: there are five daily prayers, which are said at set intervals throughout the day starting at dawn and ending well after sunset, and each involves a beginning recitation of the opening chapter of the Qur'an (called the Surah al-Fatiha ), and then the recitation of another chapter, and bowing, and prostration with the forehead resting upon the prayer rug, and then a recitation of the tashahhud , which seems to be praise of Allah and the Prophet, and then a brief closing benediction. And then this entire process is repeated two to four times. (1) And to think that I had chafed under the oh-so-onerous burden of going to church once a week as a child! It was a long time before the evening prayer was finished. After it was done, Ahmed and Melchisidek changed into the finely-embroidered robes and keffiyeh that apparently made up their eveningwear, then left to dine with al-Qatagan and the other high-ranking Oghuz of the tribe. Ibrahim and Hamid lit the interior brazier for me before squatting in front of their cookfire outside. A kettle was hanging from a tripod that had been erected over it, which both slaves were peering into intently and conferring in hushed whispers. They shooed me away whenever I tried to come close and see what was inside, so there was nothing to do but sit beside the brazier and record the day's events in this journal. It was fully dark by the time Hamid entered the tent carrying a bowl of whatever he and Ibrahim had been working on so intently. He set it down on the carpet next to me, bowed deeply, and went outside again. I picked it up. It looked like soup—or at least, I could see objects floating in a thin reddish liquid. I sniffed it, and detected garlic and onions. I poked at the contents with the provided spoon: white beans, pieces of chopped onion, leaves from plants I couldn't identify, and chunks of meat that were probably goat or mutton. I glanced towards the doorway of the tent and saw Ibrahim hurriedly turn away to look at the fire. I took a cautious spoonful, then stared down at the bowl in surprise: it was good! Really, really good—probably the best thing I had eaten here so far. I finished the rest of the soup in record time, then pulled the burqha back on and ducked out of the tent for seconds. Hamid said something when I exited the tent with the empty bowl, then smiled cautiously. He looked at the bowl, then at my covered face, and kept smiling, apparently hoping for a reply. I smiled back, but of course the expression was lost beneath the burqha . Hamid didn't show any comprehension when I made the thumbs-up sign, and I was reluctant to do a more heavy-handed pantomime with patting my belly and smacking my lips—what if the Arab saw it as obscene? All I could do to convey approval of the soup was to say, \" Šukran ,\" and gesture at the kettle for a refill. That, at least, was understood. Ibrahim dipped my bowl into the kettle to give me more, then handed it back. \" Fasoulia ,\" he said, pointing to the kettle, and I nearly dropped the bowl in shock. \" Fasoulia ?\" I repeated. Both slaves nodded and repeated the word. I looked down at the soup as the pieces clicked together: fasoulia ! Or, as the Greeks called it, fasoulada . Barring the meat, which Greeks (or at least the Hellenes of old) rarely ate, I was having a supper fit for an inland-dwelling peasant. Had Ibrahim and Hamid cooked this deliberately, as courtesy to what they perhaps perceived as my homeland, or had the dish spread beyond the Mediterranean on its own and my eating it now was only coincidence? I would have no way of knowing the answer until Melchisidek returned to translate for me. I had no way of knowing, but I wanted it to be the former. I wanted Ibrahim and Hamid to like me and to be my friends, as much as it's possible for men and women to be friends within the bounds of propriety in the Arab culture (which isn't very much). Looking at their hesitant smiles made me want it even more; I was alone in this place with only Melchsidek to talk to, and was discovering the depth of the emotional toll that was exacted for placing all of my most basic needs for safety, food, shelter, and companionship on a single man whose continued support I wasn't entirely certain of. Thinking too hard about how incredibly tenuous my current state of wellbeing was made me want to curl up in a corner and cry, and it would be nice to have some friends that would help me out of something other than grudging obedience to their master's wishes. Speaking of— \"Ashley of Briggs,\" Athina said, stumping up to the tent wearing what I now knew to be her usual grimace. Ibrahim and Hamid looked at her suspiciously, understanding the foulness of her tone if not the actual words. \"Hello,\" I said, voice politely neutral. \"Does Nafisa want me to eat with her again?\" \"Yes. Tomorrow.\" \"Alright. Will you eat with me now?\" If the old woman was surprised by the request, she gave no sign of it. Her black eyes narrowed in distrustful calculation as she peered at my veiled face. \"Why?\" she demanded, blunt as ever. \"Because I want to talk to you. There is fasoulada .\" For half a second, a complex whirl of emotion flitted across Athina's face. There was nostalgia, I think, but also... pain? Distaste? It was gone before I could be sure, and she gave me no time to ponder it. \"Fine,\" she said. She snapped something at the slaves in the Oghuz language, which of course they didn't understand, but at my gesture Hamid fetched another bowl, filled it, and handed it over to the old woman with a bow that barely bent his back. She took it from him with neither word nor gesture of gratitude, but followed me into the tent and sat down on the carpeted floor. She waited in silence as I removed the burqha and sat down opposite her, then tasted the fasoulada . Her frown deepened. \"No olive oil,\" Athina said, and her expression was stony as she set the bowl aside. \"Olives don't grow on the steppe,\" I said, shrugging in apology, \"The slaves did their best.\" Athina grumbled something short and sharp-sounding. It was probably a phrase indigenous to her Thracian peasant's dialect, and therefore incomprehensible to the formal, upper-class Attic Greek I had learned out of books. \"What do you want?\" she asked. \"I... I need help.\" Athina said nothing, merely waited, and I was forced to continue. \"I'm lost,\" I blurted out. \"Very... very lost. I don't know how to explain this well, but...\" \"Where are you from?\" Athina interrupted. \"Pennsylvania—Penn's Forest,\" I said, translating the Latin name. \"I attended a, a university there—a place similar to the Platonic Academy—\" (2) \"Women do not attend…\" Athina groped for the right word for a moment, \"Schools. University , you call them. Not even noblewomen. Maybe your father indulged you a tutor—\" \"But I did attend university! I did! The university of Pennsylvania—\" \" There is no university of Penn's Forest ! There is no Penn's Forest ! Many, many travelers come through the Oghuz lands, and I have lived here twenty years and never have I heard of a Penn's Forest.\" \"It's across the sea. Not the Mediterranean—the other one, the western sea beyond it.\" Athina shook her head. \"That sea does not have anything on the other side. It's just… salt water, with no end. Nobody can cross it.\" I opened my mouth, then closed it again. What could I say in the face of that? It would be more than 500 years before Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic and opened the continents of the western hemisphere to European exploration/colonization. And besides—even if by some miracle I managed to cross the ocean as well, what would I find when I got there? Forests, wilderness, and Native American tribes. Philadelphia didn't exist. My hometown of Reading, Pennsylvania, didn't exist. I was indeed very lost, and there was no way for me to go home to my family or my life as a classics student. I was stranded here. Forever. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes and a sob threatening to rise in my throat, and ducked my head to blink hard, swallow, and master myself before I totally broke down in front of a cranky old woman. \"So the old man is not your father?\" Athina asked, ignoring my display of emotion. \"Melchisidek? No. I'm not related to anyone here.\" I wiped at my eyes with one hand. \"And you are not a concubine?\" \"I would never —\" Athina held up a hand to cut short my indignation. \"Why are you asking my help?\" \"Because Melchisidek, my benefactor... he is Muslim, and I'm afraid that he would accuse me of witchcraft or madness and cast me out if I went to him. You are the only other person I can speak to.\" \"You only speak Greek?\" \"No. I speak English , and a little Spanish .\" \"I've never heard of those languages.\" \" English sounds like this ,\" I said. \"And this is Spanish .\" Athina shook her head in confusion/disquiet. \"The first one... it sounds a little like the tongue of the Rus, the barbarian river-traders and pirates from the far north (3) . The second one is much closer to Latin, of which I understand a little bit, but it is not that language.\" The old woman fell silent, sucking thoughtfully on one of her remaining teeth and staring past my ear at nothing in particular. At last she spoke again: \"I do not think you are mad. Confused, yes, but not mad. You were sensible to come to me rather than your… benefactor, you called him, but I cannot help you.\" She stood up to leave, groaning as her joints crackled in protest. I stood up with her. \"Then who? Who should I talk to?\" The old woman shrugged. \"God, perhaps. Nothing else can bring you to a place that doesn't exist.\" I recoiled as though stung, and as I did so Athina took her leave. I watched the tent flap fall back into place behind her, then slowly sat down on the thick carpets. I looked at the two mostly-full bowls of fasoulada but no longer felt any hunger. The tears were welling up again, but this time there was no audience to prompt me to stifle them. I cried a little bit right there, then crawled to my sleeping space and dug through my backpack. I knew I still had it, it had to be—aha, here it was: my phone. The screen came alive with bright, artificial light under my fingertip, looking strange and almost foreign after two days of only fire- and sunlight. The battery was at 27%, and I switched it to low-power mode before trying to open Facebook—which of course didn't work, because Facebook didn't exist. I tapped into my Photos library instead, scrolling faster and faster until I found it. A selfie. It was the very beginning of my freshman year at UPenn, and I had taken it with my mom, my dad, and my two older brothers after they had helped me move all of my clothes and furniture into my fifth-floor dorm room. Everyone was sweating hard in the August heat but smiling at the camera regardless. Eddie was doing the bunny-ears sign behind my head as my mom kissed my cheek and my dad looked proud enough to burst. Looking at that three-year-old photo, I felt like I was going to burst—from sadness. I was crying for real now, ugly crying that put claws in my throat and made my nose drip, and I could hear Hamid and Ibrahim calling through the tent with soft, concerned voices. After several minutes, worry about my phone battery made me turn the device off and hide it away in my backpack. I hugged myself, sniffed hard, then wiped at my eyes and nose with the burqha 's sleeve as I put myself back together as much as I could. I stared at the darkened wall of the tent, trying to actually think rather than start crying like a child again. Up until now my misadventure in the 10th century AD had been... manageable. Sure, the food poisoning had been a low point, but other than that it had felt more like a school field trip than anything else; I got to speak Greek, get up close and personal with a foreign culture, try different kinds of food whose names I had trouble pronouncing... it had been fun, in a way. Even trying to figure out what I would do with my life once Ahmed and Melchisidek's ambassadorial mission was completed had been just another part of the exercise, just the next chapter of a story. Now I wanted more than anything for this misadventure to end and for me to go home, but Athina was right; only an act of God could take me back to Pennsylvania in 2018. I had an urge to do as the old woman recommended and pray. It had been my grandmother's solution to everything: car won't start? Pray the engine trouble away. Burned the casserole for Sunday dinner? Pray over the oven. Can't find the right exit on I-70? Pray. She treated God, Mary, Jesus, and all the saints and angels as her personal agony aunts. I had despised her a little bit for it before her death, but apparently hadn't escaped the influence. (And ah, I'm crying again as I write this, but the tears don't hurt so much now). I got down on my knees in front of the sleeping platform, folded my hands, and said the Lord's Prayer in English, Latin, and finally Greek, and by the time I was finished I felt... better. I had been thinking of my grandmother and her ridiculously large, gaudy church-hats rather than God, which was probably a sin, but if Grandma knew I'd been thinking about her while praying she probably wouldn't mind redirecting my sentiments to their proper recipient. I heard Melchisidek and Ahmed returning and speaking with Hamid and Ibrahim. Several minutes later there was a soft cough next to the (covered) doorway of my sleeping area. \"Daughter of Briggs?\" Melchisidek asked gently. \"Are you well?\" \"Yes, sir,\" I said, and wasn't sure whether I was lying or not. I felt more composed, but still very fragile—a few harsh words would be enough to push me over the edge and open the (newly reinforced, but still straining) floodgates to all the grief/fear/loss. \"I just... I miss my family very much, sir.\" There was a beat of soft, sympathetic silence. \"The darkness of night often allows fear and loneliness to creep into our hearts, even if we trust ourselves wholly and joyously to Allah's care,\" the old man said gently, \"Perhaps, if you sleep, you will find your troubles to be lessened if not dispelled by the dawn.\" \"That... sounds good. Yes. Thank you, sir,\" I mumbled, already crawling under the sheepskins on the sleeping platform. I was asleep before I remembered to say goodnight. CHAPTER NOTES (1) the process Ashley described is the basic formula of a single rakat , or prayer cycle. It's true that each of the Muslim daily prayers involve a minimum of 2-4 required (described as fard ) rakat , but there are also up to 6 additional rakat that are optional. Failure to perform the daily prayers without extenuating circumstances (such as if the person is sick/injured, in labor, menstruating, or in a situation where the act of praying would expose them to danger) is considered at the very least a major sin by most Muslim sects. (2) the Platonic Academy was one of the first true schools, and had a set location (Athens) and curriculum focused on the philosophy of Plato. Previously, education was given through hiring private tutors within the privacy of one's home, or else through attending the lectures of traveling Greek sophists (teachers of rhetoric, the art of public speaking). (3) the Rus are Vikings! (Yes, we have finally mentioned Vikings in this fic! It only took 14,000 words!) Specifically, they're travelers/settlers from Scandinavia (primarily Sweden, but also Norway, Denmark, and Finland) who alternate between trading with and pillaging riverside populations in Eastern/Central Europe + Central Asia. As a political unit, the Rus are a loosely-connected group of tribes speaking multiple languages and worshiping multiple faiths, but all more-or-less following the lead of a ruler based in what will become the city of Kyiv in modern-day Ukraine.[Chapter 5] It turned out that Melchisidek was right. I awoke to the Muslim dawn prayer, feeling refreshed and somehow renewed. The grief still lingered, but it was gentler now, more manageable; I was in no danger of bursting into tears if someone spoke frankly with me about my situation. I left my sleeping area, nodded a hello to Ibrahim and Hamid, and drank the tea and ate the porridge-like bowl of mashed and boiled grains they provided. It had no seasoning and was very bland, but filling. I spoke a little bit to Melchisidek, who I think wanted to make sure that I was alright, and then retired to the interior of the tent and recorded last night's and this morning's events in my journal. I had enough spare time on my hands that I could read over what I had written during the previous days, which was everything . Outside of visiting with Nafisa, there is nothing to do here. I feel like Anne Frank, hiding in the attic with nothing but her diary for company. Wait, no—that's a bad comparison: Anne was in hiding because the Nazis wanted to kill her. I'm only cooped up in this tent because my host's Muslim ideals of propriety dictate that, even when covered by the burqha , I should be exposed to the male gaze as seldom as possible. I'm not in any immediate danger. I'm still bored, though. I wanted to take out my phone and go through the rest of my Photo library, to see if I could enjoy the memories without letting them overwhelm me. I was afraid to, however, partly because I didn't want to wear down the battery any more than I absolutely had to, and also because I was worried that the slaves or my host would notice the artificial light from the screen and investigate it. What if Melchisidek confiscated or even destroyed my phone, thinking that it was dangerous or unholy? And how would he treat me afterwards, if he did? The sensible choice was to just leave the device alone. I ended up reading more of Thucydides' History next to the entrance of the tent. Speaking nonstop Greek with Melchisidek and Athina had sharpened my fluency, and the ancient scholarship was less of a chore to work through than usual. The mental juggling of geography, various ethnic groups, and who hated who a thousand-some years ago kept me occupied until midmorning. I was only roused from my reading by Athina calling my name outside. I jumped up and made to leave the tent, but retreated back inside like a startled turtle at Ibrahim's yelp of shock at my uncovered face. I threw on the burqha and re-emerged. \"What? What is it?\" I asked. \"Tell these dung-eating sons of whores,\" Athina spat, gesturing at the slaves. \"To treat their hosts with respect! I could have them killed with a word.\" \"Please, do not,\" I said. Hamid and Ibrahim were returning the old woman's glare with their arms folded across their chests, and had moved to protectively stand between me and Athina. That was... oddly sweet of them. The Oghuz slave/manservant standing behind Athina mostly just looked confused. \"I cannot speak to them,\" I said. \"I do not know their language. Does Nafisa want to eat with me now?\" \"No.\" \"Then what is it?\" \"She wishes to ride. Bring the horse.\" \"I cannot... I cannot ask them to bring Dor to us. I do not know how.\" Athina rolled her eyes and snapped something to the manservant, who hurried past us to where the ambassadorial animals were being kept. He returned a few minutes later leading Dor by the bridle. \"Now we go,\" the old woman said. The walk through the camp was much the same as the first time, though there was less staring. Hamid elected to accompany us, and made sure to position his body between me and the Oghuz manservant at all times. Nafisa was waiting just inside the entrance to her red tent. She squeaked in surprise and exclaimed something in the Oghuz language upon my and Athina's entrance, and bounced on the balls of her feet in excitement as I took off the burqha . As soon as it was off she rushed me and squeezed the air out of my lungs with a hug. I hugged her back out of reflex, and had just enough time to pat her shoulder before the girl whirled away from me and plucked up her scarf from a cushion. She cast it on over her hair, then handed me an identical one. There was more bouncing as she waited for me cover my hair and face, and then she grabbed my hand and practically dragged me out of the tent. The Oghuz manservant was waiting outside, now leading a horse with white and black splotches as well as Dor. Nafisa rushed over to the splotched horse and kissed its nose. She ran her hands over its face and through the mane, crooning to it in the Oghuz language. \"The mare's name is Tüweleý (1) ,\" Athina said beside me, also watching the display. \"It is her only friend that she could bring with her from her father's tribe.\" \"Can she visit her family at all?\" I asked. \"No. Etrek and his wives and their children are her family now.\" \"Poor girl.\" Athina grunted in disagreement, but otherwise said nothing. The manservant left and returned with rectangles of cloth and saddles. He spread the cloths over the horses' backs, then hefted the saddles onto them with soft grunts of effort. Nafisa waved him away and secured Tüweleý's saddle on her own, then beckoned me closer. She moved over to Dor, who was standing patiently, and guided my hands through the motions of tightening the saddle into place with a heavy iron buckle. The saddle tree was made of several pieces of wood with a thin leather covering riveted in place, and it had a high front arch and a low, sloping rear one. Most of the padding was underneath, for the horse rather than its rider. It looked... extremely uncomfortable. (2) Nevertheless, Nafisa urged me up into it. Dor sidestepped as I shifted my weight into the stirrup, which made the girl scold him and lightly swat his neck as I wobbled dangerously before plopping down into the seat. She adjusted the stirrups to fit the length of my legs, then stepped away and vaulted onto Tüweleý's back with unmatchable grace. The mare pranced eagerly as Nafisa settled herself, and then the girl did something with her knees that made the horse start forward at a walk. \"Put your heels into his flanks,\" Athina called out to me, \"No, further back... not quite... too far! Almost...\" Dor's ears were flat with annoyance, and he snorted impatiently. Eventually, though, I tapped my heels into the right spot, and he started into a walk after Nafisa and Tüweleý. Leaning forward caused him to speed into a bouncing trot that made me grit my teeth, and leaning back as I drew close to Nafisa made him slow down. I hadn't so much as twitched the reins. Nafisa looked back, saw me, and gabbled out something bright and excited-sounding that I hoped was praise. We rode through the camp together. It was so different than walking; people got out of our way, and I was looking down on them rather than facing them at eye level. How imperious! My only blunder was when a small child darted suddenly in front of me, and I could only panic as I tried to figure out how to brake a horse—but Dor stopped on his own, unlike a car, and all was well. When we reached the edge of the camp Nafisa leaned forward over Tüweleý's neck, making the splotched mare break into a canter across the hilly steppe. I did the same, and felt Dor's muscles bunch beneath me before he leaped forward. I clamped tight with my legs and gritted my teeth again, trying to hold back another scream—whether this one was fear or elation, though, I wasn't certain. I could hear the little horse's breathing grow harsher, and could only try to move with the muscles of his back rather than be thrown up and down with each stride. I would have fallen out of the saddle if not for the stirrups. Leaning to the side or else lightly tugging the reins left or right made the little horse change direction, and I was able to follow Nafisa. Tüweleý was the faster horse, and Dor and I couldn't catch up to her until she decided to slow down at the crown of a steep hill. Dor climbed it, his ribs heaving like a bellows between my legs, and slowed to a halt beside the mare. He lowered his head and breathed hard into the grass. Nafisa pulled down her scarf, then threw out her arms and laughed. She leaned back in the saddle so that her back was practically lying on top of the mare's rump and directed Tüweleý with her knees, making the horse turn a double pirouette as she laughed and laughed. Eventually the laughter turned to sobbing, and she covered her face with her hands. I awkwardly slid down from Dor's back and went over to her, lightly touching her shoulder. \"It's okay,\" I said in English, feeling thoroughly useless. \"It's okay. It's ok—\" Nafisa grabbed me and pressed her face into my shoulder, sniffling hard. She was still lying across the back of her horse, and I was afraid she was going to fall off. She didn't, though, and I patted her back and mumbled meaningless platitudes until she felt well enough to sit up and wipe her eyes. She dismounted and tossed Tüweleý's reins over the horse's neck, then walked to the edge of the hill. We were looking out over Etrek's camp, the human figures tiny like ants in the distance, the tents sprouting from the ground like mushrooms after rainfall, the horses and other livestock like a sea of brown and black and white upon the steppe surrounding it. The entire encampment must have extended more than a square mile, which was... incredible. We looked out over it in companionable silence broken only by the breathing of the horses. \"It's beautiful,\" I said at last. \"But it's like a prison to you, isn't it?\" Nafisa said something in Oghuz language, sounding resigned. \"Do you want to go home? Back to your mother?\" She looked at me, tired and morose, then turned back to her splotched mare and leaped onto the horse's back. I stepped into Dor's saddle with considerably less grace, but managed to settle myself and toe the little stallion into a walk when we started back down the hill. I rode with Nafisa for hours, sometimes walking, sometimes trotting, sometimes cantering. The steppe was beautiful but desolate, treeless, and lonely. Bright stars of wildflowers studded the turf, and the land sometimes sharply rose and fell, naked rocks breaking free of the ground to point skyward like crooked, stubby fingers. Most of the time, we rode in silence, but every once in a while Nafisa would point something out to me, speaking the Oghuz language with no expectation of reply. Sometimes I would speak back to her in English. The sun climbed to its zenith and then began to descend. We stopped at a brook to water the horses and drank our own share upstream from them. The water was clearer than glass and teeth-achingly cold. We watched a hunting eagle swoop down and pluck a rabbit from the steppe, and Nafisa whooped with joy, sharing in the raptor's triumph. My legs began to hurt. At first it was a manageable ache, like if I had been running too hard, but it quickly centered itself in my knees and thighs. I felt like my bones had been replaced with molten lead and my muscles had turned to jelly. Soon after that I was wincing with every step Dor took. Nafisa noticed and frowned at me, then reined Tüweleý to a halt. She pantomimed for me, showing me how to sit sidesaddle with one leg hooked around the front arch of the saddle for balance. She waited for me to copy her, and then we turned around and made our return to her husband's encampment. Nafisa waited until the last possible moment to pull her scarf over her hair and face, trusting the splotched mare to pick her way through the outer tents of the encampment as she arranged the cloth around her head. We found Athina waiting for us next to the entrance of the red tent. The old woman was dozing on a low stool, snoring softly with her head lolling to one side. Nafisa giggled and pointed when she saw her. The Oghuz manservant coughed loudly when we dismounted, making Athina startle awake. She sat up, wincing as her back cracked, and grabbed her walking stick to help heave herself to her feet. \"How was your ride?\" she demanded. \"Good,\" I answered. \"There was lots of... grass.\" She snorted, then smiled rather nastily. \"How are your thighs?\" \"I do not know if I will have the ability to stand once I get down from this horse. If I can get down from this horse.\" Athina cackled, and cackled harder as I slid gracelessly from Dor's back. My knees buckled when my feet hit the ground, and I almost sat down in the dirt before grabbing the front arch of Dor's saddle and pulling myself upright. I grit my teeth and hobbled over to where Nafisa was waiting next to Athina. \"Bravo,\" the old woman said drily. Dinner was waiting for us inside the tent. There was tea and flatbread, but also kazy , or horse sausage, served with zhal , the fatty meat directly under the horse's mane. Athina told me that both were considered delicacies, and that Nafisa was offering me high honors by serving such things. I lowered myself onto a cushion, stretched out my aching legs, and ate happily as Nafisa chattered incomprehensibly to Athina. There were no napkins and no utensils other than a knife, and by the end of the meal I was contentedly licking grease off my fingers. \"The meal was delicious. I know it is Nafisa who ordered it be so, but thank you for making it all the same.\" Athina inclined her head in regal acknowledgement. Nafisa looked at me, then said something to the old woman. \"She wishes to know when you will be leaving.\" \"In three days' time.\" Nafisa looked heartbroken upon hearing the translation. I crawled across the cushions to hug her, and as I did so I had an idea. \"Is it possible,\" I asked over Nafisa's shoulder, \"To return to my benefactor and retrieve an item within his tent, and then return here? I have a gift for Nafisa, but the giving of it will take some time, and I do not want to stay overlong.\" \"Yes, it is possible,\" Athina agreed, frowning. \"But give me a description of what you want, and I can have a slave bring it for you.\" \"It will be a bag with two large straps, dark blue like the evening sky, made of neither leather nor cloth. Your slave will have never seen anything like it.\" Athina arched an eyebrow, but nevertheless got to her feet. She went to the entrance of the tent and called out, then rattled something off in the Oghuz language and came back inside. We all sipped tea in companionable silence, waiting. Nafisa pulled away from me and took out the pins and combs securing her hair into place, and it fell down her back like an ebony waterfall. Finally, the slave returned with the item I had requested. I took my backpack and unzipped the front pocket, rooting around until I found my purse. I pulled it into my lap and opened it, shifting aside my wallet, keys, old receipts, a St. Christopher's charm my dad had given me after the Parkland shooting (3) , sunglasses, crumpled-up sticky notes with scribbled lists of what I'd needed to do or buy—and my makeup bag. Finally . Nafisa and Athina were watching me intently, their eyes fixed on the otherworldly items that made no sense to them. \"Please translate,\" I said, making Athina tear her gaze away from my car keys. \"Where I come from, many women like to enhance their appearances with colored pastes and powders that they put on their faces. I have some with me. Would Nafisa like to try them?\" Nafisa listened to Athina, then nodded. She pointed to my purse and gabbled something inquisitive. \"She wants to know what all of that is,\" Athina said. \"It is... things I brought with me from my homeland. The one that doesn't exist.\" The old woman's eyes snapped to my face and narrowed ever so slightly, but then she turned away and translated for Nafisa. The girl had taken my wallet and was sifting through it with a look of intense concentration, and had selected a debit card that she was tapping with one fingernail and trying to bend in half. It snapped, and she jumped in surprise before running her fingers over the jagged plastic edges. I winced, but said nothing—it wasn't a big deal; I could just call PNC and get them to issue me a new card when I got ho— when I— if I— if I ever — I shuddered and came back to myself as Nafisa nodded eagerly and made grabby hands towards the bright floral print on my makeup bag. I forced my mouth into a smile and opened it, immediately discarding the far too dark foundation and concealer and instead gravitating towards the bright, fun liquid lipsticks and eye shadow, blush, and highlighter palettes. Which I had a lot of. And I mean a LOT. It's true that my mom, my aunts, and all my friends called me a makeup fiend, and I did occasionally go on spending sprees at Sephora and Ulta when the stress of finals exams got to me, and that my makeup bag took up 80% of the space in my suburban-mom-sized purse, but how on Earth did I have so many palettes and lipstick collections? This was ridiculous. I grabbed a double handful of plastic tubes and cases and spilled them out onto the braided horsehair rugs covering the floor of the tent. And so the fun began. Nafisa snatched up a Juvia's Place eye shadow palette, Afrique, running her fingers over the brightly colored, smooth, glossy cover. She traced the shiny metallic lettering and then lightly touched the front illustration of two women's faces—dark-skinned women, like me. She looked up at me for a moment, then down at the picture again, then touched her cheek. She frowned and said something. \"She asks, is it for her?\" \"Tell her yes, anyone can wear what's inside.\" Nafisa felt at the edges of the packaging, her fingers slipping over the smooth surface, and after a few light, wary tugs managed to break the magnetic seal holding the lid down. Her eyes widened when she saw the mirror on the inside cover, then widened even further when the face inside the mirror made the same expression. I bit my tongue to stifle a smile as the girl made faces at herself—even the cheap mirror inside a 21st-century makeup case was better than what 90% of all the glassmakers in the entire world of the tenth century could create; Nafisa had never before seen her own reflection so clearly. And then she noticed the eye shadows. When out clubbing with friends I tended to forego the classic smoky eye for a bright, full-out glam worthy of a Mardi Gras party, and the reds, greens, and blues had been depleted, but Nafisa gravitated to them anyway. She ran her fingertips through the shadow and then gasped softly at the bright colors that stained them afterwards. She rubbed it over one cheek, which made me make a disapproving noise before I could stop myself. \"She asks, what is the proper way to apply this... powder?\" \"I can put it on her, if she wishes it.\" \"...Yes.\" Nafisa was squirming with excitement as I seated myself in front of her, and she was smiling so widely that her eyes crinkled—there was no place to put the shadow. \"Smooth face! Smooth face!\" I said. \"Be calm! Think about, um... dead frogs.\" Athina snorted in derision, but translated. Nafisa made a disgusted face at that, and I tapped her nose to make her jump. She settled down after that, her expression turning neutral and the lines of her face smoothing out. \"What does she want to look like?\" \"...Like the sky over the steppe in the springtime, like the wind moving through the grass.\" Athina rolled her eyes. \"Like freedom.\" I frowned at her, but the old woman only sniffed and settled herself more comfortably on her cushion. Whatever. I tried not to chew my lip as I thought. The blue of the Afrique palette was... too deep, maybe, for Nafisa's light skin? I'd never done a white girl's makeup before. Procrastinating, I thumbed through the familiar palettes, discarding Nubian (nudes) and Warrior II (reds) immediately, waffling for a few moments over Festival (reds again, but with a noteworthy pink and shimmery blue) before I saw the yellow-green packaging of Tribe. Opening it revealed exactly what I hadn't known I'd been looking for: greens and golds. First, the dark hunter green on the middle to the outer lid and surrounding area. And Nafisa's paleness provided so much contrast ; on my own lids I'd need to apply a primer to get this much effect. A quick streak of rich yellow gold along the underside of the brow bone, and then cover the middle and inside of her lid with the bright, light green. Blend, and then a pale yellow to the inner portion of the lid. Blend that as well, then a dot of white gold at the tear duct, and... I dived back into my makeup bag and surfaced with a bright aqua eyeliner pen. A careful swipe of that along the edge of her lower lid, another swipe with a black pen that somehow formed a half-decent wing, and we were done. I held up the mirror. Nafisa gasped. \"...She says it is beautiful,\" Athina translated, then yawned widely from something other than tiredness. \"Would you like to try the powders as well?\" I asked. She made a disgusted face. \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Playing with paints and powders is for the young. I am old. I have no need of wasteful diversions.\" I sighed, but could recognize an unwinnable battle when I saw it—and this wasn't the time for one anyway. I went back to Nafisa. We fooled around with my makeup kit until the lamps were guttering low from lack of oil, trying on different faces. I did a classic smoky eye with some blush and lipstick that looked like it came straight out of the 2010's, which was in stark contrast with Nafisa's 10th century dress/robe getup. She wanted a bright red warrior mask with gold accents after that, which I obliged her, and then she got to practice on my face. She went hard on the greens, purples, and bright reds, which made my 21st century sensibilities cringe in horror—but at the same time it was intensely interesting. Nafisa (probably) had no concept of modern color theory or any of the symbolism that I associated with each color. Green for plants was obvious, yes, and the jump to vitality and freshness was an easy one, but in my own time (and at least in Western culture) that color was also associated with poison. Purples concerned luxury and royalty, red was for war and love, white for purity, blue for calmness... It was likely that the Oghuz culture didn't think about colors that way. I was itching to ask Nafisa about it, but Athina seemed to be in an even fouler mood than usual and I didn't want to push her. It was Nafisa who bothered the old woman first. She had started to fall asleep, and Nafisa snapped her fingers twice to startle Athina awake before gabbling something in the Oghuz language. Athina blinked the tiredness out of her eyes before translating. \"She wants to see you apply your powders onto yourself. She does not think you usually wear a rainbow on your face and wants to know what you normally wear.\" I used some makeup wipes, removing Nafisa's bright but clumsy efforts and feeling... odd. Of course I had a \"normal\" face that I put on before classes or even just to run to the store for something, but to wear it here ? I should be going through this routine in the bathroom of the suite I shared with Rachel, Summer, and Fatima, wearing the latest styles from Charlotte Russe and trying to remember the meaning of the words \"phospholipid bilayers\" for the upcoming test in my Introduction to Biology class. Instead, I was kneeling on braided horsehair rugs in a tent made from actual leather somewhere in Central Asia in the year 932 CE. It felt like whiplash. Or some really weird form of jet lag. I went through the motions mechanically, applying primer and then a layer of foundation, covering all the little spots and skin tags and brightening my skin. Nafisa was staring at me intently as I looked into the little hand mirror I kept in the kit. It was probably sacrilegious to say so, but going through my morning makeup routine was almost as calming as prayer had been last night. Next was highlighter along my cheekbones, the tip of my nose, and a small dab in the center of my chin. I blended, then used some nudes on my eyelid after touching up my brows, and finally finished with eyeliner wings and mascara. \"How do I look?\" I asked Nafisa. \"...She apologizes for calling you ugly yesterday. You are not.\" \"Thank you.\" Nafisa seemed oddly subdued after that. She kept looking at my foundation, which was far too dark for her, and then back at my face. We continued using the makeup, but the playful feeling had gone out of it. Nafisa spent a lot of time squinting into the mirror, biting her lip and trying to get everything just right. We stopped only when Athina had to refill the lamps. I picked out which palettes I wanted to give her. She liked bright colors, so Tribe and Afrique were a given, but it was always good to have nudes for a more basic look, so I threw in Nubian as well. I added some primer and blush, since those were the only ones of my skin products that would work with her color, as well as the lipsticks she seemed to enjoy the most. I felt no reluctance while giving my makeup away—it was useless to me now, after all—and the sadness I had managed to push away while riding and playing with cosmetics had returned. Nafisa seemed to feel the same way, and moped as Athina shuffled around the tent with her jug of oil. She spoke with her slave, which I didn't pay attention to until Athina started translating. \"She wishes you to spend the night here.\" \"...Why?\" \"Because you are her only friend and are going away soon.\" \"I must seek permission from Melchisidek for this.\" Athina shrugged. \"Then we go.\" I put on the burqha and exited the tent, blinking hard in the sudden darkness outside its warm, lamplit interior. Dung-fueled cookfires burned bright throughout the Oghuz camp, sending up plumes of reeking smoke. People were still laughing and talking everywhere, and a woman nearby was singing in a throaty but earnest voice. Hamid was squatting at a campfire with a group of Oghuz, playing what looked like knucklebones. Occasionally someone in the group exclaimed triumphantly, and pieces of silver were exchanged. He looked up guiltily when I called his name, then hurried over. Our walk through the camp was uneventful, and Melchisidek was surprised but not reluctant to grant my request. When we returned, Nafisa had selected a shift made from lamb's wool for me to wear as a nightgown, and had already changed into her own sleepwear. She showed me to a sleeping platform, which was different than what I had slept on in Melchisidek's tent in that it had a mattress made of a leather pad stuffed with grasses. It was also big enough for two people. I lay down on it, a little bit shocked at the luxury I was being offered... and then Nafisa cuddled up beside me. \"Why is this happening?\" I asked, politely disentangling myself. Nafisa pouted. \"Nafisa wishes to sleep next to you,\" Athina said, the corners of her mouth twitching upwards as she noticed my discomfort. \"Tell her this is... uncommon where I live. People do not sleep next to each other unless they are lovers.\" Nafisa listened to the translation, then shrugged and re-cuddled me. Was this normal for female friends and relatives among the Oghuz? If entire families lived in close quarters in tents like these, and if the winters were cold, then it didn't seem implausible. Nafisa was quite content to put her head on my shoulder and go to sleep as Athina doused the lamps and banked the coals of the central brazier, but I was intensely uncomfortable as I listened to the old woman moving around the tent. I could only lay there in the darkness, trying to think of a way to change the situation without offending my host. Her hands didn't wander, which—thank God. Just thank God for that. Never mind that we technically had a chaperone in the form of Athina, but I was in bed with a minor and internally having a meltdown over a propriety-related culture clash. Eventually, when Nafisa's breathing had slowed and I was 100% certain she was asleep, I slipped off the sleeping platform. I arranged some cushions and a fur near the brazier and lay down there. \"Is a soft bed truly so horrible?\" Athina asked softly. Her eyes glittered in the faint glow of the banked fire from the corner where she apparently slept. \"No. But I am unaccustomed to sharing one. I will sleep better alone.\" Athina grunted. \"Nafisa always sleeps alone. Maybe, with your paints and powders, Etrek will look at her again.\" I froze. Athina continued: \"She will have a child once he lays with her again, and she will be happy.\" \"Nafisa is fourteen ,\" I whispered, forgetting myself. \"She is a child herself; she is too young to have children.\" \"I was thirteen when I had my first,\" Athina said, shrugging. \"She has not yet fully grown a woman's shape, and the birthing will hurt her, but if she survives her labor the next ones will be easier.\" Oh. Oh my God. I had never thought—I had seen giving Nafisa some makeup as just a innocent, girly thing for us to share. Instead, I might very well be aiding in child sexual abuse. Oh my God. I hadn't wanted to make Etrek actually desire his adolescent wife, just for us to have fun. Now... \"It is different in my homeland. There, the laws say women cannot marry until they are at least eighteen, and it is common for them to wait a half decade or more to marry a man of their choosing.\" \"Your homeland sounds like a dream, if it exists.\" \"...What was your life like before you became a slave?\" I found myself asking. In the darkness of the tent as Nafisa slept, it felt like a time and place where walls could be lowered and secrets aired. \"My daughter's name was Damalis. That is all I care to remember,\" Athina replied. In the gloom of the tent I couldn't see her face clearly, but her voice was full of weariness and sorrow. She shifted the conversation before I could continue needling her with questions: \"Where will you travel after you leave us?\" \"I will go north with my benefactor to the land of the Volga Bulgars, and from there I do not know.\" \"The lands to the north are filled with bandits and barbarians. You will need your pendant.\" \"My... what?\" \"The bauble in your bag, the little silver icon.\" \"The St. Christopher's charm?\" \"Yes. He protects travelers. You should pray to him.\" \"Are you a Christian?\" \"Once,\" Athina admitted. \"A long time ago. Go to sleep, Ashley of Briggs. Past the lands of the Oghuz you will need all your strength.\" (1) another Turkmen word, Tüweleý means \"whirlwind/tornado\".

What are you doing?\" Katrina, hisnsecretary, asked as she walked through the double doors of his officenholding the papers he had asked her to copy. She stared at him as hentouched his carpet in dead awe. Zorg looked up and smile pleasantly.n\"You're here too? How did you die?\" He asked before passingnout. His mechanics had stopped working from the heat. \"Indo not know what happened, he was acting really weird and then henjust passed out,\" Katrina told the doctor. The doctor helped hernlay Zorg on the examination table. \"What do you mean by weird?\"nDr. Cruz asked as she put a thermometer in the unconscious man'snmouth. \"He was petting the carpet,\" Katrina said. Dr. Cruz justnstared at the secretary for a moment before returning to Zorg'snexamination. \"What was he doing right before he started actingnweird?\" The doctor asked. Katrina shrugged. \"He was going tonFlotsan Paradise and I thought he had already left a while ago,\"nshe said, \"but I guess not.\" \"FlotsannParadise?\" Dr. Cruz asked. \"Yeah, but I guess he never left,\"nKatrina decided. \"He's half android?\" The doctor suddenly askednthe secretary. Katrina nodded. \"When he was a teenager his fathernwas in the Siriiean war… and Mr. Zorg was helping him… with thenweapons and things and he stepped on a claymore and half his body wasnpretty much destroyed,\" the secretary explained, \"and so to keepnhim alive his father paid to have android parts put in… half of hisnbrain is a CPU, neat huh?\" She asked. The doctor snorted. \"Wellnthat's why he won't wake up,\" she said. \"His mechanics havenstopped working. They need to be fixed. I'll send up for anstretcher and we'll bring him down to the humanoid repair centre,\"nDr. Cruz said as she picked up the telephone. \"Whatnthe hell happened?\" Zorg asked as he opened his eyes. \"You'renokay!\" Katrina dove onto the hospital bed and hugged her bossntightly. She could feel his one muscular shoulder and his other metalnone. \"W-why am I in a hospital?\" He asked as he sat up quickly.nKatrina made him lay back down. \"Your mechanics had a malfunction…nI really don't know why… but we had to get you fixed,\" shenexplained as her boss looked around with a confused look on his face.n\"What do you last remember?\" Katrina asked as she stroked thenhalf of his head that had hair. \"I remember we were arguing overnwhich printer worked better,\" he said. \"And I remember Rosieninvading my office… and,\" he said before Katrina interrupted him.n\"Mr. Zorg that was a while ago… you don't remember telling mennot to disturb you unless Mr. Shadow called? Or the priest? Ornanything like that?\" She asked remembering the guards violentlynbringing a priest in and then throwing him out. Zorg thought for anmoment. All he remembered was a woman with fiery hair. \"No,\" hensaid. \"I remember a woman with orange hair,\" he said. Katrinanlooked confused. He couldn't possibly be thinking of her… she hadnblue hair—not easily confused with orange. \"What about the stonesnsir? Don't you remember the stones?\" She asked. \"The stones youndropped out my window onto someone's head who ended up suing me?\"nHe asked. Katrina raised a brow. \"No, not those stones,\" shensaid. \"You don't remember Mr. Shadow?\" She asked. \"No, I toldnyou,\" he said in his thick accent that sounded rather southern,n\"other than what I told you I only remember a woman with orangenhair… I don't remember her name… what was it…?\" He mutterednto himself. \"Ooh… Mr. Shadow's gonna' be pissed,\" she saidnas she clicked her tongue. \"Who is Mr. Shadow?\" Zorg asked.nKatrina cringed nervously: Mr. Shadow would indeed be angry if Zorgndidn't remember him… \"No one,\" she said. She rather likednZorg before he started doing evil things for Mr. Shadow. \"Hownare you feeling Leeloo?\" Korben Dallas asked the fiery haired womannas she snacked on a huge chicken by herself. \"Leeloo good,\" shensaid with a choppy accent of unknown origin before sticking a largenpiece of chicken into her mouth. Korben smiled, she seemed fine. \"Hownis she, dear?\" Korben's new wife, Lily-Ray, asked as he walkedninto the kitchen of their new house… that actually had andecent kitchen. \"She's good. She's eating… watchingntelevision… she's doing better,\" he told his wife who hadngotten rather attached to Leeloo since first meeting her whilendriving to dinner with her husband. They were in Korben's fancy newncar when suddenly a woman had just dropped out of nowhere! Lily-Raynthought she was the cutest thing… she kept telling Korben shenwanted to adopt her as their daughter but Korben would have none ofnit. Leeloo was too much like a pet than a daughter… but he couldn'tnhelp loving her. She was cute… she was just like a puppy… or anninnocent child. \"Zorgngo badaboom?\" Leeloo asked rather sadly as Korben and Lily walkedninto the room with her. The married couple looked nervously at eachnother. Leeloo was too innocent to talk about death with… evennthough Zorg was evil and all… Korben still thought that she wouldnbe sad to know he was dead. \"No… no… he just… left early,\"nhe lied. Leeloo nodded. She didn't seem to mind that Zorg hadnnearly shot her to death… she was so loving… no matter what.n\"Evil bastard damn-near killed her and she's still concernednabout him,\" Korben muttered to his wife. Lily-Ray nodded innagreement. \"Whyndoesn't he remember anything?\" Katrina asked Dr. Nadine Cruz.n\"I'm not really sure,\" she said. \"Maybe the CPU got a littlendamaged.\" Katrina thought for a moment. \"Oh!\" It suddenly hitnher. He could remember everything except… except for anything to donwith Mr. Shadow! Which meant… \"Mr. Shadow's dead!\" She cried.n\"Huh?\" Dr. Cruz looked oddly at her. \"Mr. Shadow's dead andnZorg is free!\" The excited secretary ran down the hallway towardsnher boss' room. When she got there she saw Zorg searching throughnthe medical supplies and piecing different ones together to makensomething deadly. \"Mr. Zorg, what are you doing now?\" She asked.nHe grinned and hid his invention behind his back. \"Mr. Zorg! You'renfree to leave now!\" She said as she pulled her boss up and slid hisnmulti-coloured coat on before yanking him out the door. She noticednhe had his little invention with him… How Zorg-esque. \"Infixed the printer,\" Katrina said as they walked into Zorg'snoffice. She had actually fixed it a while ago but he wouldn'tnremember… so… to reinstate their sweeter relationship she wouldncontinue from where they left off. \"That's good, I told you itnwas broken,\" Zorg said. \"Oh shut up,\" Katrina joked. She wasnglad she was able to joke with him again. During Mr. Shadow'sn\"reign\" she couldn't even talk to him without being yelled atnfor something. She liked her Zorg better… Leeloonslid her coat on (\"Leeloo, it's getting cold at night now so you must wear your coat outside… always,\" she rememberednKorben commanding her). She walked out of the house and down thenside-street, which was connected to the buildings. She had learnednnot to be afraid of heights since she was first awakened and had thatnlittle run-in with the \"people in funny outfits\" as she callednthem. She was going to find Zorg. She knew he was being controlled bynthe Bad Thing and she was going to help him. If he just left early henmust already be home then… \"Katrina,nwhy did you follow me home?\" Zorg asked as he got ready for bed.nHis secretary followed him nervously. \"Because I want to make surenyou're okay,\" she said as she fixed his hair, which was getting anbit messy. He swatted at her. \"I am not a child… I can take carenof myself,\" he said with a joking angry-face on. \"Okay… but I'mnsleeping over… just in case your mechanics decide to shut downnagain,\" she said. \"Katrina, darling,\" he said, \"people at thenoffice are going to star thinking we're having an affair if younstay for the night.\" Katrina giggled, she honestly wouldn't mindnthat very much… \"I'm just staying to keep an eye on you… Dr.nCruz's orders,\" she said as she set up a sleeping bag next to hisnbed. \"Sure,\" Zorg said sarcastically as he lay down. Leeloonlooked up at the bi, blue sign bearing his name. ZORG it said. Shensmiled and walked up the floating walkway. She walked up to thenreceptionist. \"Zorg?\" She asked. \"Zorg?\" The woman lookedncuriously at her. \"Mr. Zorg has gone home for the night, but I canntell him you came. What is your name Miss?\" The receptionist asked.n\"Leeloominaï Lekatariba Lamina-Tchaï Ekbat De Sebat,\"nLeeloo announced. The woman just stared at her. \"I can give you hisnbusiness cellphone number if it is important,\" she suggested… notnwanting to memorize that name. Leeloo nodded, it was important. Thenreceptionist handed her a piece of paper with the number on it andnLeeloo walked out. Zorgnsat up violently with his eyes widening. \"LeeloominaïnLekatariba Lamina-Tchaï Ekbat De Sebat!\" He shouted. \"What?\"nHis dreary secretary asked. \"AGH!\" He jumped when he noticednsomeone on the floor. \"Mr. Zorg? What does that mean?\" She askednas Zorg bounded out of bed. \"It's the woman's name!\" He criednexcitedly. \"The woman with the orange hair!\" He raced over to hisncomputer began typing without even sitting down first. \"What arenyou doing?\" She asked. \"Searching, she must be in thendirectory—or not,\" he muttered as the site came up negative. \"Howncan she not be in here? Everyone from this planet is innhere,\" he muttered. \"Maybe she is not from Earth,\" Katrinansuggested. \"Yeah,\" Zorg said, getting a bit discouraged. \"Zorg!\"nZorg jumped when he heard his name being called from outside. Katrinanlooked nervously at her boss. Zorg looked out the window at the fierynhaired girl who was standing on the walk. \"Zorg?\" Leeloo lookednup and held out the paper with his number on it. She had searched hernown CPU for his address using his cellphone ID. \"L-LeeloominaïnLekatariba Lamina-Tchaï Ekbat De Sebat?\" He asked. How thenhell does he memorize that? Katrina thought getting a bitnjealous. Well, her mind continued to ramble, he has tonmemorize his own incredibly long name… She began trying tonrecite Zorg's full name to herself. He was not originally fromnEarth and had a very long name because of his customs on his planet.n\"Leeloo,\" Leeloo told him. \"Leeloo,\" Zorg raced down thenstairs and towards the front door. He pulled it open and smiled atnthe bright girl. \"Zorg! No Zorg badaboom!\" She leapt towards himnand hugged him happily. He felt a chill through his chest. \"Leeloo…nwho…\" he led her into the house despite the time of night.n\"Leeloo,\" Leeloo simply explained… who are you? I'm Leeloo ofncourse… \"Mr. Zorg, who is this?\" Katrina asked jealously as shenwalked down the stairs. \"This is Leeloominaï LekataribanLamina-Tchaï Ekbat De Sebat,\" Zorg said with a grin. \"Zorg,nis your name longer or shorter than hers?\" Katrina asked randomly.n\"Longer,\" Leeloo announced. \"Huh? You know my full name?\" Henasked. Leeloo nodded. \"Gage-Gaston Abdukrahman SheromacciinnJean-Baptiste Emmanuel Casimir Runielle Zorg,\" she recited with oddnsimplicity. \"Wow… I thought your name was just Jean-BaptistenEmmanuel Casimir Zorg,\" Katrina said. Zorg snorted. \"The customnis to name a royal of Siriiea after the first three generations andnthen give them their own name… so my loving mother gave me thenlongest name she could possibly think of along with the three pastngeneration names,\" he explained. \"What are the three pastngenerations and what is your real name?\" Katrina continued…nhoping to keep him away from this mystery woman. But the mysterynwoman persisted too. \"Generation One: Gage Gaston Zorg. GenerationnTwo: Abdukrahman Sheromacciin Zorg. Generation Three, father:nJean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg. Cultural Name: Casimir Runielle Zorg,\"nLeeloo said in a robotic tone. Zorg and Katrina just stared at her.n\"Okay… if you can explain all that then can you explain whynyou're here?\" She asked Leeloo. Leeloo puffed out her chestnproudly. \"Leeloo no want Zorg go badaboom,\" she announced beforenhugging Zorg again. \"No badaboom,\" she said.[Chapter 2] Spooky's Angel : Gracias mi amiga!

Cirquenatomique du amor Suchna man I do adore. -\"UnnGout Petit de Amor\" Zorgnlay down awkwardly in his bed with his secretary on the floor next tonhim and the fiery-haired woman clinging to his body possessively. \"No badaboom,\" shenreminded him as he straightened out his blankets. \"Yeah, yeah. I know, Inknow,\" he said as he tried to make her loosen her grip around hisnoddly tiny waist. \"No badaboom,\" she saidnmore sternly as she sat up and stared angrily at him. \"Inswear, I won't go badaboom,\" he told her. She snorted and layndown next to him, again clinging tightly to his waist. She was not going to let him die. Never. She was meant to protect life and therenwas something very special about this one that she would protect withnher life… even her chicken she decided. She would give her chickennaway to save Mr. Zorg. She decided she would also give away hernchocolate ice cream if the situation called for it… then she putnherself to sleep with the skill she had recently picked up. While shenslept however she kept a tight grip around the skinny man's waist. \"K-Katrina!\" Was whatnLeeloo heard the next morning as she awakened. She looked up intonZorg's eyes and saw a serious lack of air. \"Katrina! Help!\" Zorgncried as he tried in vain to pull away from Leeloo's death grip. \"L-Leeloo!\" He squeakednas his strength began to drain. \"Leeloo sorry,\" she saidnas she grinned innocently and released him. \"No badaboom,\" she addedna condition to his freedom however… \"I know, I know,\" he saidnas he breathed heavily. Katrina popped up out of her weary spot onnthe floor. \"What's the matter Mr.nZorg? Are you alright?\" She asked as she climbed up onto the bednnext to him. \"I-I'm fine, just fine,nsorry,\" he said as he coaxed her off his bed. He really couldn'tncomplain… having two pretty women in his bed was a gift from God,nbut he was still not used to being in such a state… although henhated to admit it, he was still a bit timid around other people…nespecially women. He didn't know how to react around Earth women.nAn alien was a bit… well… information-lacking on an Earth-stylenlove life. \"Go back to sleep, sorrynKatrina,\" he said as he stepped over her and dodged Leeloo'snswat. It was after all only five-fifty in the morning. He walked outnthe door and down towards the bathroom. He reached out and opened thendoor. \"No badaboom!\" Leeloo wasnstanding in the bathroom door scolding him. He shrieked and jumpednback. \"L-Leeloo! How the hell…?\"nHe backed up and felt confusion spinning through his head. \"No badaboom,\" shenscolded again as if going into the bathroom would cause this event. \"Yeah, yeah,\" he said, \"Inknow. I'm just using the bathroom,\" he tried in vain to convincenher he was not going to be blown up. She moved out of the bathroomnsuspiciously and allowed him to walk in. \"Nonbadaboom,\" she muttered a reminder as he walked by her. He held upna yeah, sure hand as he closed the door behind himself. \"Nonbadaboom!\" She screamed as she pounded on the door. \"Do you mind? Give him anbreak,\" Katrina said as she walked out of Zorg's bedroom. \"Leeloonmind,\" Leeloo said. She wasn't quite sure what the blue-hairednlady meant by that but sure… whatever. Better to agree thanndisagree with these humans. Katrina just stood there in confusionnbefore the bathroom door opened. \"Do you two mind?\" Zorgnsaid drearily as he poked his head out. \"Leeloo mind,\" Leeloonrepeated again. He raised a brow at her before shaking his head andnturning to Katrina. \"Why are you two standingnin front of the bathroom…? It's very… awkward,\" he said.nKatrina's cheeks turned crimson. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"Kitchen?\" Zorgnsuggested. \"Go get breakfast or something is ya ain't going backnto bed,\" he said as he went back into the bathroom. Leeloo listenednfor a moment to make sure there were no explosions before Katrinandragged her off towards the kitchen. Zorg listened for a moment tonmake sure they were gone before he turned on the shower. \"What do you want fornbreakfast?\" Katrina asked as Leeloo sat pouting at the kitchenntable. \"Chicken yummy,\" Leeloonannounced. Katrina raised a brow at her. \"Chickennat six in the morning?\" She asked. Leeloo glared evilly at her. Howndare you question my answers? That fierce look said. Katrinangrinned and began looking through Zorg's cabinets for anninstant-chicken-dinner package. She laughed… they kind of remindednher of the MREs they used to use in the wars hundreds of years ago…nshe'd learned about it in history class and ran home to tell hernmother, absolutely fascinated by them. \"Whatnthe hell are you doing?\" Zorg asked as he walked downstairs,nstill soggy from his quick shower, but completely and sophisticatedlyndressed in black pants and a white twenty-first century-lookingnt-shirt under a black overcoat. He was staring at the giant chickenndinner Katrina was pulling from the microwave. \"She wanted chicken fornbreakfast,\" Katrina said as she pointed to Leeloo. Zorg just starednat her, a bit confused, as Leeloo began to munch hungrily on hernchicken breakfast. \"Or do you mean me using your stuff withoutnasking because well… you said not to wait at the bathroom door andnthen you suggested breakfast and so,\" she began. \"No, no. It's fine,\"nZorg told her as he started sifting through his cabinets next tonKatrina trying to find something good for breakfast. \"What do younwant?\" He asked her as she moved aside and stood shyly in thenbackground. She shrugged. \"Indon't know,\" she said as her cheeks misted red. The only otherntime she had slept over Zorg's house was when he had broken hisnspine (he had climbed onto a shelf at the office and fell off… hownZorg) and that was only for one night under doctor's orders to makensure he didn't do anything stupid to himself. She didn't spendnmuch time with him because he had refused any help she offered. Henwouldn't even let her get him anything to drink… he insisted onngetting it himself. Too stubborn sometimes , she though with ansmile. She had left early anyway and didn't stay for breakfast…nshe had never seen Zorg's domestic habits when he wasn't inndesperate pain. It was rather… enthralling to watch the habits ofnthe one you liked… She thought with a girlish giggle that made Zorgnlook over at her and reminded her of his question. \"Whatever younwant to give me,\" she said as she sat down at the table next tonLeeloo. \"Chicken yummy,\" Leeloonreminded her holding out a piece as an offering. Katrina thenvegetarian held out her hands. \"No thank you. It is allnyours,\" she said as she glanced up at Zorg who was climbing ontonthe counter to try to reach the higher shelves. She smacked hernforehead. \"Mr. Zorg do you not remember the last time you did thatnat the office? You fell and broke your back,\" she reminded him. \"I know,\" he said as henpulled down a little bowl and handed it to her. He pretended to fall,nmaking her jump and then showed her he was screwing with her bynputting his foot down and walking off with an evil grin. \"Mr. Zorg!\" She scoldednas she held the bowl. \"How about some cereal?\"nHe ignored her scolding and pulled out a bowl for himself beforenhanding her the box. \"Sure,\"nshe said with a smile. She was seriously thinking about worshippingnthe bowl, for her darling had touched it… You know… Laura'snright… you are obsessed , she thought of her best friend at thenoffice who was the only one she had told about her liking for hernboss. \"Gee Kat,\" Laura had saidnto her when she discovered the photo of Zorg Katrina carried aroundnwith her, \"you really are obsessed with the man.\" She giggled atnthe thought and made Zorg look at her again with a confused face. \"So,\" Zorg said with hisnthick accent as he sat down at the table on Leeloo's other side,n\"where did you come from?\" He asked her as she munched happily onna leg of the chicken. She shrugged at his question. \"Regeneration lab,\" shensaid pointing towards the east side of town where the lab wasnlocated. Zorg nodded in confusion. \"How did you get here?\"nHe asked. Leeloo shrugged again… not really because she couldn'tnanswer his question—just because she liked the motion… \"Walked,\" she said. Hennodded again, still not really getting the story. \"How about,\" he began. \" Why are you here?\" The jealous secretary asked. Leeloo glared at hernagain before diving out of her seat and onto Zorg's lap. \"Wh-what?\" He asked asnshe clung to his shoulders making him drop his spoon into the bowl ofncereal. \"No Zorg badaboom!\" Shenscreamed with a large smile on her face. Zorg buried his crimson faceninto her chest. \"Inswear I will not explode ,\" he tried again to convince her. \"Sonwhy are you here… besides the no badaboom thing?\" Katrinanasked… still wanting an answer before she killed the woman forntaking her man. \"Leeloo want Zorg be good,\"nshe said as she hugged him tighter. She wasn't about to let anynEvil take her man. Zorg just looked at her with a bewildered face. \"What do you mean good?\"nHe asked. \"No remember 'cuz Mr.nShadow go badaboom,\" Leeloo explained. \"So Leeloo show you,\"nshe said as she kissed his forehead. Next she pointed a finger atnhim. \"Leeloo show you.\"[Chapter 3] Spooky'snAngel : ¡Más gracias mi amiga! (I am so glad someonenelse loves Gary Oldman too! He is soooo kyoooot!

Leeloo's hand remained on his forehead asnhis third eye was opened to all the horrors they had lived. He saw angroup of aliens… mangalores , he thought, why was I withnthem? The answer soon came next. The stones. Mr. Shadow… andnLeeloo. He saw Leeloo climb up into the ventilation system in FlostannParadise. Then he could see himself as if he were floating aboventhem. He had a weapon. It looked a bit familiar… it looked exactlynlike the plans for the new ZF-1. But then he saw himself aim upwardnand fire it at Leeloo. \"No!\"nHe screamed as he pulled away from Leeloo's hand. \"Nonbadaboom,\" she said as if the memories would make him forget this. \"I-Inknow… L-Leeloo,\" he said as he looked up at the woman who wasnstill sitting on his lap. \"W-what happened? In Flostan Paradise?\"nHe asked as a nervous tremble began to overtake him. \"Mr.nShadow make you bad. Make you get stones to destroy world,\" Leeloonsaid simply as she reached over and grabbed another piece of hernchicken. \"Whonis this Mr. Shadow?\" He looked at both Leeloo and his secretarynbecause he had remembered Katrina also mentioning something about anMr. Shadow. \"Mr.nShadow ultimate evil,\" Leeloo explained. \"Really big bad thing,\"nshe said. \"Oh…nso why was he controlling me?\" Zorg asked. He was really confusednand wanted answers. \"Becausenyou're one of the most powerful men in New York,\" Katrinananswered his question before Leeloo had finished chewing. Zorgnsnorted at this. \"Readynfor rest?\" Leeloo asked as she put her pointer finger on hisnforehead again. He sighed heavily. \"Yeah,\"nhe said as he leaned back and allowed the rushing feeling to oncenagain take over his body. Nownhe was leaving the injured Leeloo and placing a bomb on the door ofnthe hotel room they were in. Then he grabbed a box and left. Nextnhe saw himself on his spaceship with the box. He opened it and pulledna psycho act saying, they're not here… Strange. Thenstones, he remembered as he watched himself run back off thenspaceship and into Flostan Paradise… killing guards as he went. Henreleased a rather psychotic laugh as he watched himself run into annelevator just as three men and Leeloo ran out. He stared for a minutenat the man he somehow knew was Korben Dallas before he was whiskednback into his story. He suddenly realized that he'd never actuallyngotten to meet this Korben Dallas. Henwas running down the hall towards the bomb. When he found it he slidnhis access key into the slot and turned it off. That however wasnright before another bomb was activated… he got a random flash of anmangalore pressing a detonator. Lowly fuck… that's who triednto blow us up, he thought as he watched himself nervously swear.nHe saw the flames suddenly come shooting out of the bomb but then hensaw something else… he saw a man behind him. He couldn't reallyntell who it was through the explosive light but he could see thenman's tall, skinny outline. Then the man behind him put his hand onnZorg's shoulder and they both disappeared into thin air just as thenParadise cruise exploded. And s did Zorg's train of thought… \"Agh!\"nHe jumped and Leeloo grabbed him. \"See,nno badaboom,\" she said as she hugged him. \"Y-yeah…nLeeloo… I am so sorry,\" he said timidly as Leeloo pettednhis head. \"NonZorg bad, Mr. Shadow make Zorg bad. Leeloo make Zorg good,\" Leeloonattempted to explain. \"Ah,nwell…\" Zorg rubbed his eyes before Leeloo jumped off of him.n\"Uh,\" he wasn't sure what else to say. \"Don't we need to benat the office?\" Zorg asked Katrina as he dumped his cereal out. Hendidn't feel much like eating now. \"Ohnyeah!\" Katrina bounced out of her seat and threw her cereal intonthe garbage as well. \"My boss is gonna' kill m—\" She observednthe surprised look on Zorg's face before laughing hysterically. \"Katrina… I'm your boss,\" he said as he slid on a coat and picked upnhis bag. \"And Leeloo, do you want a ride back to… wherever youncame from?\" He asked as Leeloo tossed the chicken bones into thengarbage and her plate into the dishwasher. Itnmakes them easier to wash, she remembered Korben telling her. \"Leeloonwalk,\" she said as she picked up her coat and walked out with thenweapons designer and his secretary. \"Arenya' sure?\" Zorg asked as he unlocked his rich looking black car. \"Leeloonsure,\" she said as she bent over and kissed his forehead againnbefore walking off. \"Leeloo be back!\" She called as she ran offndown the side-streets, avoiding the swerving cars that were flyingnall around her. \"No badaboom!\" Was the last thing Leeloo saidnbefore disappearing around a building corner. \"Yeah,nno badaboom,\" Zorg muttered to himself with a smile as Katrinanslipped into his car on the passenger's side. \"Sonwhat is up with her?\" She asked. \"Who is she?\" Zorgnshrugged. \"She'sna crazy baby,\" he said with a laugh. \"A perfect crazynbaby.\"[Chapter 4] Loki14 : ¡Hola yngracias!

Thenprinter works now… but it's been working for a while… Henthought randomly as he picked up the papers and tossed them into thenshredder. \"Mr.nZorg?\" One of the material transporters poked his head into thendoorway of Zorg's office. \"W-what?\"nZorg jumped out of his seat as if… as if I were about to gonbadaboom, his mind muttered as he walked towards his employeenwith his traditional limp. \"Sir,nwe're out of steel base,\" the man said timidly to hisnas-of-lately explosive boss. \"Oh…nuh,\" Zorg looked at the circular window behind him as if it wouldngive him some sort of suggestion. \"Go… ask Katrina for the numbernof the… uh… whatever store sells it,\" he said as he walked backnover to his window. He always looked out it when he was in deepnthought. And today he was very deep in thought… about thenfiery-haired woman. \"Umm,nokay,\" the young employee raised a brow at his spaced-out bossnbefore walking out of his office. \"Whatntime is it?\" Zorg asked the empty room. He realized the employeenhad left and felt like a schizophrenic as he looked around for anworking clock. In his office it was perpetually eleven twenty two innthe morning. \"Mr.nZorg?\" A purple-haired woman poked her head into the room. She kindnof resembled a violet-headed Katrina, although skinnier and paler. \"Whatntime is it?\" He asked without even looking up to see who it was. \"Inthink it's nine oh five,\" she said as she continued to stand innthe doorway. \"Oh,nthank you,\" he still didn't look up. \"Mr.nZorg, we're out of plastic base,\" she told him. \"Whonthe hell is eating my materials!\" He cried. \"Leeloo,nwhere did you go?\" Korben asked the next morning as he walked outnof his bedroom sleepily to find Leeloo hanging up her coat. \"Leeloonvisit Zorg. Tell him no go badaboom,\" she said proudly as she satndown on the couch. \"Give Leeloo breakfast too.\" Korben's mouthnfell open. \"Z-Zorg?nYou mean the Zorg? The one who exploded?\" Korben said as hisneyes widened. \"NonZorg badaboom!\" Leeloo erupted as she ran over to Korben and clungnto him nervously. \"No Zorg badaboom!\" She wailed. \"Wh-what?nB-but… n-no… like I told you… he didn't go badaboom… onlynleft the ship early,\" Korben tried to convince her through his ownnconfusion. Zorgnis still alive? That good for nothing bastard, he thought tonhimself. \"Whyndid you go visit him, Leeloo? How did you even find his house?\"nKorben asked. \"Leeloonmake him good. He remember and he still good,\" she announced as shenhugged Korben tighter. \"Whatndo you mean, make him good? Leeloo, he shot you,\" henreminded her. \"Mr. Shadow bad… Zorg good,\" she argued back. \"Leeloo… shot you. He shot you… \" he tried again. \"Mr.nShadow didn't shoot you, Zorg shot you.\" Leeloo shook hernhead defiantly. \"Mr.nShadow make Zorg shoot Leeloo,\" she explained but Korbennstill didn't believe her. \"Leeloo,nhow long were you there?\" He asked, realizing only then how hardnhis heart was pounding. \"Leeloonsleep over,\" she said, \"sleep with Zorg.\" Korben's eyesnalmost fell out of his head they opened so wide. \"What!\"nHe cried, waking up his sleeping wife. \"Leeloonsleep with Zorg,\" she said. \"Whatnthe hell did he do to you!\" Korben wailed asnLily-Ray walked out of the back bedroom. \"GivenLeeloo chicken,\" she said. \"Leeloo…\"nHe didn't think she'd understand even if he said it straight out…nthen he found it. \"Did he take your clothes off?\" He asked as hisnheart pounded ever harder. \"No,nLeeloo sleep in clothes,\" she said and he sighed. \"Leeloo,nwhy don't you stay away from Zorg, okay?\" Leeloo gave him ansturdy eye-meeting stare. \"Okay,\"nshe said as she shook her head. … \"Gage-GastonnAbdukrahman Sheromacciin Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Casimir RuniellenZorg!\" Leeloo wailed from below the open bedroom window thatnevening. \"L-Leeloo?\"nZorg asked as he poked his head out the window. \"Leeloo!\"nShe cheered when she saw him. \"Justna minute,\" he said as he ran down the stairs and let her in. Whennhe opened the door she noticed his bare chest. She'd never seen anbare male chest before… She stared at him, unreservedly fascinatednbefore poking at his body. He had a very nice figure for such anskinny man. Although you could see his ribs, it was still muscularnand shapely. \"Dot,\"nLeeloo said as she poked a scar across his left ribcage. \"W-whatnare you doing?\" He asked curiously as she continued to poke. Hencould feel a strange chill circling in his stomach. \"Scar?nZorg get hurt?\" She asked as she embraced him. \"Ohnthat, it was a long time ago,\" he said as she squeezed him tighter.nHe could only feel the pressure on his left side… but it was stillnenough to cut off his breathing. \"L-Leeloo,nI'm okay,\" he said as he pried her off. \"It was a long, long time ago.\" \"Leeloonmiss Zorg,\" she said as she smiled at him, showing off her perfectnteeth. \"I-Inmissed you… too Leeloo,\" he said. He wasn't sure if it wasnquite true… or if he just didn't want to admit it was. \"Good,nice-cream?\" Leeloo opened the brown messenger bag she was carryingnaround her shoulder and pulled out a box of chocolate ice cream. \"Wherendid you get that?\" He asked her as he led her into the kitchen. \"Korben'snhouse,\" she said as she placed the box down on the kitchen table. \"Herenyou go,\" he said as he handed her a perfect glass bowl. It had nonscratches, no cracks, no stains. It was perfect. Zorg was a verynmeticulous man. There was never anything out of place in his home…nthe same couldn't really be said about his office although it was usually neat… except on days when his mind was wandering.nHis desk was particularly messy today. \"Twonplease,\" Leeloo ordered. \"What?\"nHe was snapped out of his relation of Leeloo and the bowl when shensaid something. \"Two,\"nshe reached up into his cabinet and pulled out another perfect bowl.nShe pulled a spoon out of the drawer and began to scoop ice creamninto the two bowls. \"Howndid youknow where the spoons wer—nevermind. Ice cream at nine atnnight?\" He asked as she handed him a bowl. \"Yes.nEat,\" she commanded as they sat down at the table. This, Zorg thought, must be Leeloo's idea of a date… ice creamnat nine. \"Zorgnlike?\" She asked as she spooned some into her own mouth. He noddednand muttered yes through his full mouth. He was never a big fan ofnice cream but tonight it just seemed to appeal to him… it was tastyntonight. \"Nonbadaboom?\" Leeloo made sure he hadn't exploded yet… no that henwas sitting right there or anything though… \"Hm-mh,\"nhe shook his head no. \"No badaboom, Leeloo. Don't worry,\"nLeeloo smiled and nodded too. \"Leeloonwant to sleep over,\" she announced as they put the dirty dishesninto the dishwasher. \"Thanknyou,\" the dishwasher announced. Zorg jumped. \"Inhate it when it does that,\" he muttered as he switched thenautomated voice off. \"Leeloonwant to sleep over,\" she said again as he turned to face her. Shenwas still captivated by his chest and it showed. \"Uhh…nwould Mr. Dallas mind?\" He asked nervously. Leeloo shook her headnno. \"Leeloongot permission,\" she said as she held out a thumbs-up. \"Um,nokay then,\" Zorg led her into the bedroom. Before he could evennsuggest a cot or sleeping bag she bounced onto the bed and cuddledninto his blankets. When she noticed him just standing there shenreached out, grabbed his arm, and pulled him down next to her. Hernjob wasn't finished yet. Next she spread the blanket around both ofnthem and cuddled against him. \"Leeloonlove Zorg. Goodnight,\" she said as she cuddled gently against hisnchest. He felt his heart pound as his mouth fell open. \"Korbennsay when sleep together you must take Leeloo's clothes off,\" shenannounced. Zorg gasped. \"What!\"[Chapter 5] Loki14 :n¡Gracias una otra vez! ¿Hablas Español? … Fijanadmirable Ay, y tengo que encantar Korben por su consejo loco…nHehehe… gracias por reseñando.

Fornthis queen you think you own… Wantsnto be a hunter again… Tonbe a hunter again… -Didon\"Hunter\" Zorgnmoved around nervously once Leeloo had fallen asleep. \"Korbennsay when sleep together you must take Leeloo's clothes off.\" He shouted at himself for it but honestly… he had to refrain fromndoing what Korben had supposedly suggested. He began to pull awaynfrom Leeloo. \"Whatnthe hell is wrong with you?\" He muttered to himself as henstood in front of the sink in the bathroom. His face was drippingnwith the water he had just splashed himself with. \"Younknow exactly what's wrong, pilgrim,\" his mind muttered to him. \"Y-yeah,\"nhe said quietly as he reflected on the strange stirring in his lowernstomach. \"I know.\" \"Ugh,\"nhe muttered to himself as he walked back into his bedroom. \"No badaboom,\" shenreminded him yet again as he walked in. \"Yeah. Yeah,\" he saidnwith a laugh and a glance. Leeloo was cuddled sweetly under thenblankets. Then however he noticed her bare shoulder sticking out nearnher chin and a tiny pile of women's clothing on his floor… \"Zorgnno do it, Leeloo do it for Zorg,\" she explained as she pulled thenblanket away to show him. \"Agh!\"nHe felt a cold shock blast through his pelvis as he stared at her. \"Leeloontake good advice Korben say,\" she said as if she didn't evennnotice the bloody nose Zorg was experiencing. \"Y-yeah,nyeah. Really good advice should always be taken,\" he coughed asnblood sprayed violently onto the floor. He wasn't sure if he wantednto grab her and do her now, or just begin laughing insanely. He feltnthe insane laughter coming anyway with the blood flowing down hisnlips. \"Leeloonfix,\" she said as she climbed out of the bed and wiped his face offnwith her shirt. He pulled away, still laughing, and still admiringnher. \"No,nno, I'm fine,\" he insisted as he pulled his own shirt off thendresser and wiped his face off. \"Wow,\"nLeeloo said like a child looking at a new toy as she pulled open hisnpants and looked down. She was wondering what that weird vibe she wasngetting was. She had never seen any other pat of a man's bodyneither… again she was fascinated and again it showed. \"Yah!\"nZorg jumped back, not exactly unhappy about her fascination for hisnbody. \"Nosenfeel better?\" She asked as she examined his face, wondering why henhas started bleeding without first being hit… like when she hadnaccidentally opened the door on Korben's face. His nose was purplenafter. Zorg's nose looked perfectly fine. \"Ah,nyeah, yeah. I'm good. Thanks Leeloo,\" he said as she stood therennonchalantly and inadvertently teasing his lust with her perfectnbody. \"Hey Leeloo, what exactly did you learn on that screen o'nyours?\" He asked as he laid her back down on the bed and snugglednin next to her. He was a bit nervous… a bit afraid to take his ownnclothes off. He had only slept with one other person in all his lifenand it was a long time ago… he wasn't sure he was still… asngood as the past woman had told him he was. \"Leeloonlearn lots,\" she said indirectly stating, specifics, damn you. \"Uh,nwhat exactly did you learn about uh… health? The body systems?\"nHe couldn't quite get it out. What did you learn about sex,nSTDs, and protection? Was kind of what he wanted to ask. Henwasn't a virgin, didn't have any STDs, and personally didn'tncare about protection. He felt he wouldn't lose his mind should henaccidentally bear a child with Leeloo. He had the feeling he wouldnhave should him and his past mate have did so… they used birthncontrol. \"Hmmm,\"nshe thought for a moment before going on about the skeletal system.nZorg had to laugh at that. \"Hownabout the reproductive system?\" He suddenly felt like a sciencenteacher quizzing his student… She took a deep breath and began tonexplain everything in scientifically working order using the perfectnwords to make Zorg burst into another fit of insane laughter. \"Zorgnand Leeloo?\" She asked as she looked down between his legs and thennpointed to herself. This caused another short fit of laughter fromnZorg who tried to pretend he was coughing instead. \"Uhh…nLeeloo, caring for a child is a big responsibility,\" he toldnher. \"No,nno child yet silly,\" she said with a laugh she had apparentlynlearned from Lily-Ray. \"Leeloo and Zorg, Zorg and Leeloo,\" shensaid as she unbuttoned his pants, which he had neglected to changenout of when flopping down into bed. He'd been thinking too much. \"Y-yeah,nsure,\" he muttered in a half-trance as she slid off his remainingnclothes. \"Repaduction?\"nShe attempted to pronounce as she pointed between his legs. His facenturned red before another fit of laughter overtook him. \"Yeah,\"nhe muttered once his laughing fit had ceased. \"Yeah.\" And Leeloonsuddenly knew what it was Korben and Lily-Ray were doing that nightnshe had walked in causing them to jump and scream. Leeloongiggled when Zorg leaned down on top of her and began to kiss hernneck gently, running his face through her perfectly wild fiery hairnand making his way periodically to her lips. She had the odd feelingnthat she should run her hands up his back and touch his hair. So shendid just that, admiring the silky feeling of his straight black hair.nShe could almost feel how shiny it would be tomorrow morningnwhen she opened her eyes to the dawning of the sun. \"L-Leeloo,\"nZorg gasped when she leaned in and kissed his neck, nipping it a bitnas she felt the urges to. She realized that her intuition was a goodnthing. Whatever it told her to do felt really good… and made himnact even more fiery. \"Zorgngood? Good?\" She asked as she reached down and touched his stomachnand progressing lower… another little intuitive motion. She onlynrealized then how much of his ribs were really manifest through hisnperfect skin. \"V-veryngood,\" he muttered as he allowed her to continue. An intuitivengesture. Leeloonopened her eyes to the awakening of the morning sun. She looked overnand saw the lovely shine of pure ebony she knew would see. Shencuddled against his body and nudged his nose with her own. His eyesnopened slowly and she smiled at him. \"Nonbadaboom,\" was naturally the first thing she said. Zorg laughed. \"Yeah,nI know,\" he said. Then she continued as if they had only justnawakened. \"Hi,\"nshe said with the voice of all innocence and perfection. \"Hi,nLeeloo,\" he said with a slight scratch to his voice as he wrappednan arm around her… it was his mechanical arm. \"Zorgngood,\" she told him as he leaned down and kissed her chestnlovingly. She had the odd feeling he would like to be told that. \"Whynthank you, Leeloo. You're not bad yourself… for a supreme being,\"nhe said with a mocking smile. Leeloo stuck her tongue playfully outnat him. \"Zorgnsupreme being,\" she said as she stroked his firm but bony chest. Henlaughed quietly. \"No,nI'm not strong like you, not immaculate, not…\" She let himnthink but when she realized he couldn't think of anything else tonsay, she kissed him, making him stir again. She could feel himnstirring against her leg beneath the blankets. It was a nice feeling.nIt made her chilly and yet warm. Zorg moved in closer to her and wasnready to begin again when the telephone rang. \"Damnnit,\" he muttered as he reached over and picked it up. Leeloo smilednat him. \"Hello?\"nHe said, however with his autumn accent of the southern states itnsounded more like, \"hay-loh\" than \"hell-oh\". Leeloo had tonsmile at that too. She couldn't help it. \"Yeah, this is Zorg.nThis is—Katrina! Calm down!\" He shouted into the telephone andnLeeloo looked up curiously. \"Okay,\" he said as he pulled Leelooncloser to him. \"We'll be right over—well… Leeloo. Leeloo'snhere,\" he said after a shout sounded from the other end. \"I know,nwe'll hurry. Bye… Katrina! We'll hurry… remain calm… \"nHe said, trying to quiet his hysterical secretary. \"Okay, we'rencoming now, bye,\" he hung up and slid off the bed with Leeloo. \"Whatnhappen?\" She asked nervously. \"I'mnnot really sure, Katrina wants us to come to the office immediately,\"nhe said as he pulled on a new pair of pants that were long and black. \"Okay,\"nLeeloo said as she put on her own pants. They were actuallynLily-Ray's, but she had said Leeloo could keep them… Next shenslipped on her original white shirt before Zorg noticed the driednbrown bloodstains from the evening before. \"Leeloo,nhere. Put this on,\" he handed her a clean white t-shirt from hisndrawers. \"Thanknyou,\" she said as she pulled off her shirt and slid his on. ……………………………………………………………………………………………….. \"Shenwent to his house again, didn't she?\" Korben moaned as he pacednback and forth in front of Lily-Ray who was sitting on the couch. \"I'mnsure she's fine, honey. If he let her sleep in his bed and servednher breakfast I'm sure he's treating her well… anyway… didn'tnshe mention something about him being good now? That it was just Mr.nShadow making him act evil?\" She tried to calm her husband. \"OhnI don't think he'll mistreat her… I think he'll rape her,\"nKorben muttered more to himself than to his wife. \"Korbenndear, that's called mistreatment,\" Lily-Ray informed her franticnhusband. \"Okay,nhe'll seduce her,\" he tried. \"Wellnhe is kind of good looking,\" she said, not exactly meaning it tonsound as it did. \"What!nI gotta find them!\" Korben wailed as he grabbed his coat and rannout the door. \"Wherenare you going!\" Lily-Ray shouted as she ran out the door afternhim. \"I'mngoing to Zorg's office! Damn workaholic is bound to be there!\" Henshouted as he jumped into his car, closely followed by his wife whonleapt into the passenger seat. He started the car before her door wasneven closed all the way. \"Korben!\"nShe screamed. ………………………………………………………………………………. \"Katrina!\"nZorg raced into the main hall and saw Katrina standing at her desknlooking nervous. \"What's going on?\" He asked as Leeloo ran upnto him and clung anxiously to his real arm. \"Someone,\"nKatrina choked though tears, \"someone's sick,\" she said. Zorgnlooked at her with a confused demeanour. \"What?\"nHe asked. \"Mr. Zorg, someone's very sick.\" She saidnthrough gasping breaths. \"Where? Who?\" He askednas he watched her nervously shredding her papers to little bits. \"Laura,nmy friend Laura,\" she said. \"Shownme where,\" he said as he followed her down the hallway with Leeloonstill clinging nervously to his left arm. Katrinanopened the door to the materials lab. \"Laura,\"nshe said as she walked over to the cot she had set up for her friend.n\"Are you okay?\" She asked the bloody-faced girl. \"M-Mr.nZorg?\" The blonde woman looked up drearily towards her boss. \"Whatnthe fuck happened to her?\" He asked as he backed away a bit. \"Indon't know Mr. Zorg. She's been coughing all day and suddenlynwhen I was in here with her she began to cough blood and her nosenbegan to bleed, her eyes,\" Katrina said as she sobbed. \"Is shengoing to die?\" She asked in a quieter voice as not to scare Laura.nZorg looked at Laura, opened his mouth to say something, and thennunable to think of what exactly, closed it again. \"Callnthe hospital,\" he said after a moment of thought. \"It's obviousnshe needs a doctor and we need to figure out what the hell she has.\"nLeeloo stood there nodding with his words. \"You know what, I'llncall. You stay here with her… but just… don't touch the bloodnor anything,\" he said as he pulled Leeloo out the door. \"What'snthe matter?\" Zorg asked as Leeloo began to cry. \"Leeloonsupposed to protect people. Leeloo not be able to no more?\" Shenasked through tears. He felt a shock go through his chest. \"No,nno Leeloo,\" he said as he picked the telephone and dialed thenhospital. \"We're just going to have a doctor look at her—hello,nthis is Casimir Zorg. I'm calling from my office on North StarnAvenue,\" he said when someone picked up, \"one of my employees isnvery sick. She's bleeding.\" \"Isnsomeone watching her, Mr. Zorg?\" The woman on the other end said. \"Yes,nbut she doesn't know what t do, what could it be?\" He asked. \"Annambulance is on the way to the Zorg Office Building right now. Fornnow do not move her and do not touch any secretions, it could be anninfectious disease,\" the receiving lady said. \"Yes,nthank you,\" he said as he hung up. \"Leeloonwant to help, Leeloo want to help,\" Leeloo moaned as she sobbednonto his shoulder. \"Notnnow, Leeloo. Maybe you can help when the doctors get here,\" hentried to keep her from running back into the room. \"ButnLeeloo made to protect life, Leeloo supposed to protect!\" Shencried. \"It'snokay, it's okay,\" he felt odd comforting someone… he didn'tndo it much, but he liked comforting Leeloo. It made his chest (or atnleast the half that he could feel) become very warm and… sparklynwas really the only other word he could think to describe it. \"I'mnsure you'll be able to help soon.\" \"Leeloonbad! Leeloo bad!\" She wailed as she struggled to get away from himnand run into the room. \"Leeloo!\"nHe shouted as he pressed her against a wall and held her tight. \"You must stay out here… Leeloo… I don't want you toncatch whatever sickness Laura has, okay? I don't want you to getnsick too,\" his voice lowered to a calming whisper that she couldnnot disobey as flashing lights and sirens sounded from outside. Zorgnlooked up and released Leeloo as four men in EMT uniforms ran in, twonof them carrying a stretcher, the other two carrying a big medicalnbox. \"Wherenis the patient?\" They asked demandingly as Zorg turned to look atnthem. \"Rightnthis way,\" he said as he led them down the long hallway towards thenbloody hunter.[Chapter 6] Loki14 : Gracias again!nI am glad you like fluffy cuddling because this story is to go tonhave much of it!

A man as fine as the holynsilk… Some day you'll find… Lady Chanteuse… -\"Lady Chanteuse\" Leelooncontinued sobbing into Zorg's shoulder as the medics examinednLaura. She couldn't protect her… she couldn't protect her… \"Sir,nthis doesn't look good,\" the tall, skinny EMT with the shortnblonde hair said as he turned towards Zorg. \"Whatncould it possibly be?\" Zorg asked as he held Leeloo with his realnarm. \"Inam not quite sure, I want to get a pathologist in here. But we can'tnbring her to the hospital for fear of transmission,\" the EMT said.nZorg's mouth fell open. \"You'renjust going to leave her here?\" He asked as he walked closer. \"Staynaway, Sir,\" the tiny EMT with the long, black hair and orientalneyes said. \"It looks like an infectious disease, a very deadly one.nThe doctors may want to quarantine your building.\" \"What!\"nZorg looked from the blonde EMT to the black-haired one. \"Fornnow I want you and these two to stay in your office, I'm going tonstay with her while they go and get some doctors,\" the black-hairednEMT said motioning to Katrina and Leeloo and then to his threencoworkers. Zorg didn't move at first, then he looked at Laura'snpleading face and nodded in agreement. \"It'snalright, Laura. They're going to bring the doctors, you'll benokay,\" Katrina said to her friend as Zorg pulled her and Leeloonaway. …………………………………………………………………………………………. \"Wow,\"nLily-Ray said as they pulled up to the Zorg Office Building. \"Thisnplace is huge .\" Korben just stared at her. \"Comenon,\" he said just as three EMTs ran out of the building carryingnsome medical equipment. \"Inwonder what happened here,\" Lily-Ray said as she directed Korben'snattention towards the medical workers. \"OhnGod! Leeloo!\" Korben screamed as he ripped the car door open andngot out just as the ambulance drove away. \"Shit! Come on!\" Hencalled to his wife. \"Korben,nwait!\" Lily-Ray cried as she tripped out of the car and followednher husband up the walk. …………………………………………………………………………………………. \"Incan't believe they wouldn't take her to a hospital,\" Katrinansobbed. \"Incan't believe they quarantined us,\" Zorg muttered as he put hisnface down on his desk. Leeloo walked over and put her hand on hisnback. \"Doctorsntake care of sick?\" She asked and Zorg looked up. \"Yeah,ndon't worry,\" he said as she sat down on his lap, causing a tinyngrowl to sound from Katrina's throat. \"Leeloonhelp soon?\" Zorg sighed. \"Asnlong as you do what the doctors tell you to do then you are helpingnthem,\" he said as he ran a hand through her perfect hair. Thendoctors had arrived, six pathologists. They had discovered more sicknin the building. Three of Zorg's material transporters, two of thenmanufacturers and, and two delivery men were sick… eight in allnwere sick now, including Laura, who's condition was not improving. …………………………………………………………………………………………. \"Leeloo!\"nKorben screamed madly as he ran down the hall of Zorg's building. \"I'mnsorry sir, we need to examine you,\" a woman in a white coat said asnshe walked out of the darkness. \"Wow!\"nKorben slowed down and stopped when the woman pointed to a room. Shenwanted him and his wife to go in. \"Why do we need to be examined?\" \"Therenhas been an outbreak of a very virulent disease in this building andnit is being quarantined,\" the woman said as she began to examinenKorben's eyes and mouth. \"What section do you work in?\" Shenasked him. \"In'on't 'ork 'ere,\" he said before she pulled the stick offnof his tongue. \"I don't work here,\" he repeated. \"I'mnlooking for Mr. Zorg,\" he told the doctor. He didn't seem phasednby the mention of a disease until something hit him. \"Lily! What ifnLeeloo got sick?\" He cried. \"Ma'am,\" he said as he turnednback to the doctor, \"did you happen to notice if a women withnbright orange hair and blue eyes was among the patients?\" He askednnervously. \"Ohnno,\" she said without a second thought. \"I could never forgetnher, the one with the bright orange hair. She is healthy andncurrently being quarantined upstairs in Mr. Zorg's office with Mr.nZorg himself and his secretary,\" the doctor relayed all shenremembered. She had to hold herself back from saying that the womannwith the orange hair was lucky to be with Mr. Zorg, not only did shenthink him gorgeous, rich and intelligent, he also seemed very kind,ncomforting the sobbing woman. \"She'snwith Zorg!\" Korben exploded and Lily-Ray had to douse the fire anbit by rubbing his back and telling him all was well. \"Yes,nyou two seem healthy but unfortunately I can't let you leave untilnthe quarantine is over. I'll need to send you up to Mr. Zorg'snoffice. I believe that room shall serve as a slammer, so go on. It isnroom number forty-six on the second floor. Don't you or anyone elsenleave, I will be up with food and other necessary items later so donnot go anywhere,\" the doctor said as she walked out the door andnpointed to the elevator. \"Thanknyou!\" Korben was gone before the doctor could say anything else. …………………………………………………………………………………………. \"Leeloonwant foooooood,\" she moaned as she clung to Zorg's shoulders,nstill sitting on his lap. \"It'snokay Leeloo, the doctor said she'd come up with food soon,\" Zorgnsaid as he leaned against her shoulder. Katrina stood up suddenly,ncausing one of the glass cases displaying Zorg's weapons to fallnand shatter. \"Damnnit!\" She screamed as she attempted to catch it but failed…npurposely trying to get Zorg's attention. \"Aw,nshit,\" Zorg said as he and Leeloo stood up. He walked over to thenglass shattered all over his floor and began to pick it up, piece bynpiece. \"Mr.nZorg, I am so sorry, so very sorry,\" Katrina said as tears oncenagain fell down her cheeks. \"Katrina,nit's only a casing, it's fine,\" he said as he tossed his fullnhand of glass into the garbage disposal hidden behind a picture onnthe wall. He thought it made the room look neater without a hole innthe wall. \"Butnyour,\" \"Prototype?\"nHe said picking up the broken gun she was motioning to. \"It'snjust a prototype, Katrina.\" She sighed. \"Leeloonhelp,\" Leeloo said as she bent down and began to help Zorg andnKatrina clean up the glass. \"ThanksnLeeloo,\" Zorg said as they tossed the last of the glass into thengarbage disposal. \"Leeloonstill hungry,\" she announced as she sat down and began to spin innZorg's chair. \"She'llnbe up soo—\" \"Zorg!\"nThe door of Zorg's office suddenly burst open and there stood theninfamous Korben Dallas and… some random woman. \"KorbennDallas!\" Leeloo cheered from the chair as she spun. \"Leeloo!\"nKorben and the woman seemed to shout this is a song-song unison. \"KorbennDallas?\" Zorg muttered as he moved the picture back into place. \"Younbastard!\" Korben suddenly tore his gaze away from Leeloo and ran atnZorg. Lily-Ray tried in vain to grab her husband after shutting thenoffice door. \"Agh!\"nZorg yelped as Korben grabbed him and slammed his tiny body againstnthe back wall. \"Whatndid you do to Leeloo! What did you do to her!\" He roared as henlet his fist slam across Zorg's face. \"Ah!\"nZorg choked as he felt the pain surge through his left side. He wipednthe blood off of his lips and grabbed Korben's arm with hisnmechanical one before he could hit him again. \"Wow!\"nLily-Ray breathed in awe as she watched the tiny man hold off hernmuscular husband. \"Whatnthe hell?\" Korben muttered as Zorg's hand clamped painfully tightnaround Korben's wrist. \"Android,\"nZorg said as he shoved Korben away. \"Korben!\"nHis wife shouted as she grabbed him. \"Stop!\" Korben ignored hernand sprinted back towards Zorg. He held out his hand and whipped itnonce again at Zorg's face. The intelligent weapons designer turnednhis face and allowed Korben to slam into the right side. Thenmechanical side. \"Agh!\"nKorben screamed as he clutched his hand in pain. Zorg reeled back andnslammed his mechanical hand into Korben's chest. He fell backncoughing before standing back up and running at Zorg again. \"No!\"nLeeloo jumped in front of her Zorg and held out her armsnprotectively. \"No hurt Zorg! Please Korben! No hurt Zorg!\" Shencried as she grabbed Zorg's body and held him tight. \"L-Leeloo,nhe's bad , Leeloo, he's evil ,\" Korben attempted tonreason with her as his wife put her hands on his shoulders. \"No,nMr. Shadow evil, Zorg good ,\" she insisted, \"Zorg good .\" Zorg leaned daintily against her shoulder. \"L-Leeloo,\"nKorben felt his heart jumping madly. He could feel his chestnthrobbing in deathly pain as he watched the blood running perpetuallyndown Zorg's face. He derived deep pleasure from it. \"Leeloonlove Zorg, Leeloo love Zorg, no Zorg badaboom… no Zorgnbadaboom, \" she cried. \"Leeloo want to protect Zorg.\"nKorben felt a stab in his chest when she said that word… love… \"Leeloo love Zorg.\"[Chapter 7] ChapternSeven: Petit Soldat Petitnsoldat Pret au combat Rase frais le matin Petit soldatnc'est ton coeur qui bat Soldat, soldat...

She feltnrather… bad doing so but she was also upset that Korben had hurtnthe one she felt so strongly for. \"Leeloo,\"nit was Lily-Ray. \"Are you sure you know what you are saying?\"nKorben's beautiful wife asked as she approached the weaponsndesigner and the fiery-haired woman. \"Leeloonsure,\" she said with a suddenly random smile. \"Mr.nZorg,\" Lily-Ray walked up to the man in black and examined him,nboots to hair. He was lovely, very sophisticated looking while at thensame point seeming rugged and strong. Zorg didn't answer her.nInstead he stiffened up uncomfortably as the rather petite womannscrutinized him. \"Inwould like to ask you a question,\" Lily-Ray said as she touched thenedge of his coat. Korben watched angrily. \"Y-yes,nwhat is it?\" He said, trying as hard as he could to hide his strongnaccent. \"Whatndo you think of our Little Leeloo?\" She said as if Leeloo werentruly her daughter. Zorg felt his throat close on him for a moment asnhe opened his mouth. \"Inuh…\" He looked at Leeloo who was smiling hopefully at him. Shenbegan to plot out in her head what she hoped he would say. Inlove her dearly. She is the mate of my soul and the dear of my heart…nI wish to never let her go… \"I…nShe…\" Lily-Ray smiled when Zorg's pale cheeks turned a lightncrimson. \"Insee,\" she said. Zorg sighed… relieved he didn't have to answer. \"Leeloonno see, Leeloo no see,\" Leeloo said… she wanted him to say it. \"Whatnare you doing?\" Korben asked his wife who was fixing Zorg'snless-than-sophisticated-now hair. \"I'mngiving them a chance… you should too,\" Lily-Ray, the pacifist,nsaid. \"Lily-Ray…\"nKorben moaned. \"He's evil… evil… He tried to shootnLeeloo!\" Zorg was suddenly hit with the memory. \"No!\"nHe pulled a small handgun out of his pocket. \"I would never do suchna thing! Never!\" He roared in a very un-Zorg-like manner. \"Hey!\"nKorben reached towards his waist and pulled out his gun. \"Stop!\"nLily-Ray cried as both men fired. Leeloo saw a flash of light andnheard Korben shout. \"Korben!\"nLily-Ray screamed as the light from Korben's laser-blaster faded.nShe looked over and saw her husband on his knees holding a pouringnwound on his upper right shoulder. She ran over to him and pulled offnher jacket before wrapping it around his arm. \"Zorg?nZorg? Zorg?\" Leeloo cried as she spun around to see Zorg who hadnsparks flying from his right shoulder. \"Zorg!\" She cried as shenran to him, completely disregarding Korben who she knew and loved sonmuch. \"Leeloo,nI'm alright,\" Zorg said as he held his arm in place. The brokennsteel was threatening to tear his whole arm off. \"NonZorg, no Zorg,\" Leeloo began to sob as she ripped off his entirensleeve and tied his arm in place much like Lily-Ray was doing tonKorben. \"Whatnthe hell is going on in here?\" It was the doctor. \"Henstarted it!\" Zorg cried pointing at Korben. …………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… \"Hownare you feeling, Honey?\" Lily-Ray asked her husband as the groupnmunched on some food the doctor had brought. They were all sitting inna circle on the floor: Zorg, Leeloo, Korben, and Lily-Ray. \"I'mnfine… no thanks to you,\" Korben looked first at his wife and thennat Zorg who was crunching on a piece of plain toast. \"Korben,\"nLily-Ray warned. \"Hey,nyou're the one who came burstin' in here and tryin' to beat mento Kingcome,\" Zorg shot back. \"Mr.nZorg,\" Lily-Ray moaned. \"Please,\"neveryone looked over when Katrina spoke for the first time. \"Nonmore… just get along, okay? Just stop…\" She said as she wipedntears from her eyes. \"Katrina,nwhat's wrong?\" Zorg dropped his toast onto the little plate andnwalked over to his secretary who was sitting at his desk. \"Nothing…nI'm just worried about Laura,\" the blue-haired secretary sobbed.nIt wasn't completely a lie… she was indeed worried aboutnLaura… but what truly pushed her to tears was what Leeloo had said. Leeloo love Zorg… But Katrina loved him too. \"I'mnsure she'll be alright. Alessa is a very good doctor,\" Zorg saidnreferring to the woman who had brought them the food. \"Sincenwhen are you on a first name basis with her? Why do all the women gonfor you!\" Katrina suddenly blurted before covering her mouth. Zorgnjust looked oddly at her. \"Inbeg your pardon?\" He said with wide eyes and a confused twist tonhis lips. \"Nothing…nI was just… I'm sorry… I'm just worried,\" the blue-hairednsecretary said. \"It'snalright, Katrina,\" he said softly as he walked up to her and putnhis left hand on her shoulder, allowing the sling Leeloo had creatednto hold his mechanical arm in place. \"You'rena fucking player,\" Korben shot at Zorg who was trying to comfortnhis secretary. \"Korben,ndear, please,\" Lily-Ray said as Korben stood shakily up, still anbit shocked from the bullet that had sliced just past his arm. \"Younbastard, you don't give a damn about Leeloo at all, do you?\" Hensnarled and Zorg turned to snarl back at him. \"No,nplease, stop it!\" Katrina cried. \"Nonmore!\" Lily-Ray grabbed her husband's shoulder and tried toncomfort him. She had never in her life seen him act this vicious. Henwas usually so calm and sentimental… she wondered what it wasnexactly that Korben had so dearly against Mr. Zorg… could it benjust because he shot Leeloo when he was in that trance of Mr.nShadow's? She didn't think that normally Korben would get angrynwith a person if it wasn't their fault… so odd. \"Whatnmakes you think that Mr. Dallas?\" Zorg said with as much respect asnhe could salvage for this barbarian. \"Because,nyou just care about how much attention you get from the girls. Wellnyou know why you get it? It's only because you've got money. Theyndon't really want you, they only care about your damnnfortune!\" Korben roared. He was sure that had to be it… \"Korben,nhoney, please, let's stop this before it gets out of hand,\"nLily-ray said nervously as she silently slipped the gun out ofnKorben's holster and glanced at Leeloo. Leeloo's eyes shined andnLily-Ray knew she understood. \"No,nZorg, no fights. No Korben, no,\" the orange-haired beauty said asnshe slid behind Zorg and caressed his back. She slowly reachedntowards his waist and pulled the gun away. \"Leeloo,nwhy is he so mean to me?\" Zorg demanded sounding like a childntattling on his older sibling. This got a snort from Korben. \"Leeloo,nhe's being mean to me,\" Korben mocked in a silly voice. Lily-Raynsmacked her forehead. \"You need Leeloo to protect you, you skinnynbastard.\" Zorg snarled. \"No,nI'm tryna' keep you from actin' like a freakin' sociopath,\"nhe mocked right back. \"And if Leeloo's the only one who can do itnthen she'll do it, right Leeloo? nod nod Good,\" Zorg said withnhis usual conversational quickness. He never seemed to stumble on anword and said everything nice and clearly. A very good merchant. \"Inam not the sociopath in this room,\" Korben pointed at thenweapons designer. \" You are the one who blasted Leeloo tonbits.\" Zorg clenched his teeth and took a deep breath. He would notnbe the weak one in this battle. He would not. \"Stop!\"nLeeloo screamed. Both Korben and Zorg turned to look at her. \"Nonmore! Make Leeloo sad, make Leeloo sad. No bad things of Zorg, no badnthings of Korben,\" she said with tears in her eyes as she lookednfrom each of the men back to Lily-Ray and Katrina. \"Leeloo,\"nZorg muttered with sentiments suddenly rushing into his chest. Shenjust looked so heroic standing in the centre of the battlefield…nholding her strong arms out to the soldiers… not afraid to getncaught in the crossfire. \"Nonmore hurt Zorg,\" she told Korben. \"No more hurt Korben,\" shentold Zorg. Zorg looked down and suddenly felt very ashamed fornshouting at Korben. Korben looked down and suddenly felt very ashamednfor shouting at Zorg. \"No battle Father Sergeant,\" she toldnKorben who looked at her in confusion. Lily-Ray understood. Korbennwas her father. \"Nonbattle Little Soldier,\" she said to Zorg as she fixed his hair. \"Nonbattle little soldier.\"[Chapter 8] Krillball6 : Muchas Gracias a tí. Inam so glad you like it!

ChapternEight: AnSecond Taste of Home Ohnfollow me home Comenand show me that you shall take the throne Pleasenfollow me my child so fair, Takenmy hand I'llnlead you there… -\"Follow Me Home\" Korbennwatched in horror as the secretary with the blue hair was carried outnof the office on a stretcher, bleeding from any spot possible. Thendoctors who were carrying her out were wearing protective viral gear…nZorg was fascinated and horrified at the same time. \"Leeloonwant to help, Leeloo want to help,\" Leeloo called to Dr. Alessa. \"Staynhere, alright Leeloo,\" the female doctor in the space suit called.n\"It will help us so much if you stayed in here and made sureneveryone else did as well… transmission is quick,\" she saidnbefore turning to Zorg. \"Mr. Zorg, the in vito pathologists took anblood sample from each patient and are testing them in the lab… wenshould have results soon.\" Zorg nodded. \"Thanks,nAlessa,\" he said as he leaned out the door. \"It'll be okay,nKatrina,\" he called after his sobbing secretary. \"You'll benalright!\" He tried to assure her before Lily-Ray grabbed the collarnof his shirt and pulled him back into the room. \"Leeloonbe good now help?\" Leeloo asked with a smile as she closed the doornand sat in front of it. No one was getting past her… \"Yeah,nyou're a real good guard. Now don't you let anyone out or innunless it's the doctors,\" Zorg said with a smile and Leeloonsmiled too. \"Leeloonbe guard!\" She saluted as she leaned back against the door. \"So…nhow long do they plan on keeping us up here?\" Korben asked, more tonanyone but Zorg, however he knew that Zorg was really probably thenonly one who was aware of an answer… \"Inguess until the disease in contained,\" yup… It was Zorg whonanswered. \"But I have no idea how long that will take.\" He lookedndiscouraged. \"Ugh,\"nKorben flopped down next to Lily-Ray on the floor. \"I want to gonhome,\" he moaned. \"Inknow, honey, I know,\" she said as she pulled him into her arms. \"Inthink they'll probably let us go soon.\" Zorg snorted. \"Ifnthey don't I'm filing a lawsuit for using my building as a hotnzone,\" he muttered. \"Why don't they take them to the CDC ornsomething?\" Lily-Ray giggled when Zorg continued to ramble on aboutnhis building and how his business would be destroyed. Such anmerchant… ……………………………………………………………………………… \"Alright,\"nDr. Alessa said as she walked into Zorg's office. \"You people arenfree to go but I want you to stay in the same place and call thisnnumber should any of you show symptoms of the disease, understood?\"nShe explained as she handed Zorg a business card. Zorg nodded. \"Alright,\"nhe said as he cheered in his mind… finally they were able to leave…nbut wait a minute—\"You want us to stay in the same place?\" Henasked. Dr. Alessa nodded. \"Itnis to prevent spreading of the disease should one of you happen tonhave it.\" Zorg nodded again, not too happy with this decision. Hendidn't mind Korben's wife that much… it was Korben he couldn'tnstand. \"Willnyou call with any updates on the condition of Katrina Surrey?\" Henasked of his blue-haired secretary. Dr. Alessa nodded. \"Wenwill, but we would need a number,\" she said. Zorg looked around andngrabbed a piece of paper. \"Thisnis my cellphone. I have no idea where the Hell we're going, so ifnanything happens to her call me. I want to know how she is,\" hensaid sternly. \"Yesnsir, Mr. Zorg,\" Dr. Alessa said as she led them out. Once in thenparking lot they all got into Zorg's fancy black car. \"Thanknyou Dr. Cyrus,\" Zorg said as he leaned out the driver's window.nAlessa waved goodbye as he drove off. \"Sonwhere are we going to?\" Zorg asked as he pulled out of the parkingnlot and into the mess of cars on the fly-way. \"Ournhouse,\" Korben blurted. \"Zorg'snhouse,\" Leeloo argued. \"Leeloo,\"nKorben moaned. \"Inwant to go to my house too,\" Zorg agreed with his dear. Then allneyes turned to Lily-Ray who reddened. Even Zorg peered at her throughnthe rearview mirror… \"So,\"nKorben said, \"where do you want to go?\" He asked. Lily-Rayngrinned. \"Well…nhow about we go to Zorg's house?\" She suggested and this got anlarge glare from Korben. She smiled innocently and leaned intonKorben's seat. \"Well think about it this way honey: if anyonendoes get sick the virus won't be all over our house.\" Korbenngrinned and nodded. \"Alright,nto my house then,\" Zorg said as he swerved the car violently off tonthe left. A couple others blared their horns at him but he ignorednit. \"Alright…nwhat are we supposed to do about clothes or anything?\" Korbennmuttered to Lily-Ray when she walked in. \"Incan call the doctor and have her pick your stuff up from your house,\"nZorg suggested. Korben hated it when he answered his questions… henwas asking Lily-Ray… not Zorg. \"Okay…nthat's gonna be a bit awkward,\" he said with a laugh. \"Hey Doc,ncan you go pick up some clothes for us? Feel free to go through ournunderwear.\" Lily-Ray laughed too. \"Yeahnit will be, but it's the only way we can get anything and I'mnsure Mr. Zorg is very limited on female clothing,\" she said with anlaugh. Zorg nodded. \"Yeah,nI don't tend to wear bras all that often,\" he said and for somenreason Korben found what he said funny… and he laughed. This madenZorg laugh too. \"Thanks,nAlessa,\" Zorg said as he took the suitcases from the pretty doctor. \"Younare very welcome Mr. Zorg. If you need anything else please call me.nUnfortunately you are not allowed to leave the house so if you make anlist I can do the shopping for you. I am very sorry, it is CDC rule,\"nshe said. Zorg nodded. \"Yeah,nI know. Thanks mate,\" he said as she waved and walked down the walkntowards her car. It was a rather long walk. Zorg's front yard wasnat least an acre… \"HeynDallases,\" Zorg said as he walked into the living room whereneveryone was watching a television program on sharks. Lily-Ray wasnfascinated, Korben was bored, and Leeloo was horrified. \"I got yournstuff.\" They all looked up at him. \"ThanksnMr. Zorg,\" Lily-Ray said as she took her suitcase and walked withnKorben up the stairs towards the bedroom Zorg had given them. \"Yeah,nthanks man,\" Korben forced himself to say as he followed his wifenup the stairs. Okay, he thought, Zorg isn't that bad…[Chapter 9] ChapternNine: SonLittle Light I always knew that the secrets could hurt me Innever knew it was yours that would kill me I never tried to benyours to take care of You never said you were mine to bewarenof How many more will there be?

I'm glad.\" Korben sighed. \"Yeahnwell, he's not as bad as he was at first… I guess…\" he tried.nLily-Ray snorted. \"Inthink you two just finally discovered that each other is not so badnanyway,\" she said. Korben sighed again. \"Yeahnmaybe. Leeloo isn't sleeping in there with him is she?\" He asked.nLily-Ray made a face. She hadn't thought about where Leeloo wasnsleeping… she just kind of assumed that she was in a room…nsleeping… uh oh. \"Indon't think so, honey,\" she assured her paranoid husband. Korbennglanced at her. \"Injust want to be sure,\" he said as he slid out of bed and towardsnthe door. \"Korben,\"nLily-Ray called in an attempt to keep her volatile love in the room. \"I'llnbe right back,\" he lied as he walked out. \"Ohnno,\" his wife muttered under her breath as she too slid out of bednand followed him down the long, dark hallway. ………………………………………………………………………………… \"Nonbadaboom,\" Leeloo said as she cuddled into Zorg's warm body. \"Nonbadaboom.\" Zorg laughed. She was still very determined. \"Nonworries, alright Leeloo. I don't plan on going badaboom,\" henassured his worried angel. Her frown turned into a smile as she begannto nuzzle with his shoulder using her nose like a puppy. Zorg laughednand ran his hand through her fiery hair. \"Leeloonbe good? Leeloo be good? Help doctors?\" She asked as Zorg admirednher hair. He loved the colour. \"Yeah.nYou were really helpful Leeloo,\" he said as he continued to playnwith her hair. \"You did not let anyone leave and no one came in butnthe doctors, and you stayed too. You were very helpful.\" She smilednat him and licked his lips like a puppy would. He laughed. \"Leeloonlike help,\" she commented before licking his lips again. She heldnthe puppy-eyes in place on his for a moment until he couldn't holdnhimself back anymore and she got what she'd come for: a kiss. \"Zorgnhelp, Zorg help,\" she muttered as he cuddled against her and kissednher neck gently. She giggled and wrapped her arms around his tinynbody. She would never let him go badaboom. Never. Never. Never. \"Whatnthe Hell are you doing to her!\" Zorg thrust away fromnLeeloo and fell backwards off the bed when Korben burst into hisnbedroom. \"Zorg?nZorg?\" Leeloo leaned over the bed and gasped when she saw himncrumpled on the floor in a heap of blankets. \"Whatnare you doing!\" Korben roared as he pulled the weaponsndesigner up off the floor just as Lily-Ray ran in. \"Korben!\"nShe cried. \"Huh?\" She just watched nervously as Korben releasednthe death grip he had on Zorg's shoulder. Lily-Ray was afraidnKorben was going to rip off his mechanical arm, which was already innbad shape from the blast. \"What'sngoing on?\" Korben asked with a little less fire as when he firstncame in. Zorg's trembling eased a bit. He didn't look scared…njust nervous. He was just trembling… like a child. Like a littlensoldier new in battle. \"Nonbad, Zorg good to Leeloo,\" Leeloo said as she crawled to the end ofnthe bed and embraced Korben's waist. She cuddled against him andnrepeated her statement. \"Zorg good, Zorg good to Leeloo.\" Korbennsighed and then looked back at Zorg. \"Keepnit that way,\" he said threateningly as he led his very confusednwife out and back to their bedroom. Zorg glanced from the door wherenKorben had just left back to Leeloo who was staring at him. Shenshrugged. \"Korbennwant Zorg to keep being good,\" she said with a smile as she helpednhim back up onto the bed. Zorg smiled at her as he tackled her backnand hugged her. Leeloo laughed with feeling. She laughed with love.n\"Zorg good!\" …………………………………………………………………………… \"Korben,\"nLily-Ray held her nervous husband. \"He'll be good. I know henwill.\" Korben took his head off of her shoulder and glanced deeplyninto her dark brown eyes suddenly feeling what he knew Leeloo feltnfor Zorg. \"Yeah,nI know,\" he said and Lily-Ray's eyes widened a bit. \"I knownhe'll be good. He loves her and she loves him… so… I know that…nI love you… and I could never do anything bad to you. Love doesnthat to people,\" he explained his reasoning and Lily-Ray laughednsoftly. \"You'rena hero Korben,\" she said as she embraced him and leaned him backnonto the bed. ………………………………………………………………………………………. \"MORNING!\" Zorg shot out of bed and bounced towards the door whennLeeloo stood in the hallway banging a pot and spoon together. \"WAKEnUP!\" Lily-Ray flew out of the bed taking the blankets with her…nrevealing Korben's bare body. \"Ah!\"nKorben grabbed his pants off the floor and put them on before handingnhis wife her dress. \"L-Leeloo,\"nZorg panted as he walked out of his bedroom followed by Lily-Ray andnKorben who walked out of their bedroom a few doors down. \"Morning,nwake up. Morning,\" Leeloo said as she led the three tenants intonthe kitchen. Zorg's eyes widened when he saw what his normally barenand boring table had become. Leeloo had set it with a floweryncenterpiece and a tablecloth (which he was currently unaware of wherenshe found it…) and an aromatic breakfast of cereal (Zorg'snbreakfast really…), toast, and bread rolls. \"Wow,\"nKorben said as Leeloo motioned him and his wife to chairs in front ofnempty white, shiny plates. \"Zorg,\"nLeeloo said as she sat him down in front of the plain cereal. Zorgngrinned when Korben made a face at the shredded wheat. \"Nonwonder you're so skinny,\" he laughed and Lily-Ray hit hisnshoulder. \"All you eat is grain.\" Zorg shot him a playful glare. \"Inain't that skinny… and anyway… I like my shredded wheat,\" hensaid as he pulled out the chair next to his for Leeloo who sat downnin it. Leeloo packed her plate full of bread rolls before sittingndown next to Zorg. \"Yummynred rolls,\" she said as she munched on one. Korben looked oddly atnher. \"Rednrolls?\" He laughed. \"Alright,nso what did Dr. Alessa plan on having us do to entertain ourselves…?\"nKorben muttered as he flopped wearily onto the sofa. Zorg shrugged asnhe bounced playfully onto the loveseat next to the sofa. He didn'tnknow how Korben could be so tired after breakfast. Zorg could getnsugar-high off a glass of (sugar-free…) water. He was always anhyper man. His parents hated it, but he couldn't help it. He wasnalways so happy and bouncy. \"Inhave no idea… maybe she wanted us to play videogames and run aroundnthe house and—\" \"Ohnmy God Leeloo, did you have to give him the sugar-coatednshredded wheat?\" Korben groaned as Zorg flew madly around the roomnliked a caged canary. \"I'mngonna go crazy in here!\" He wailed. \"Arenyou okay, Korben?\" Lily-Ray asked as she sat down next to hernhusband who looked like he was about to doze off. He nodded. \"Yup.nI am soooo,\" he tried to say while yawning, \"tired…\" Lily-Rayngiggled and leaned him over onto her shoulder. \"Sleep,\"nshe said as she stroked his hair. She couldn't help but snort whennshe saw Zorg bobbing back and forth on the love seat muttering tonhimself. \"Sleep,nsleep, sleep,\" he chanted madly as he rocked back and forth withnwhat looked like clinical insanity. \"Lily-Ray,\"nKorben muttered as he stood up quickly. \"What'snthe ma—oh no!\" The woman with the long black hair said when shennoticed her husband's bloody nose. \"Korben! No!\" She pulled thenbox of tissues off of Zorg's side table and began to wipe away thenseemingly endless blood flow. \"No, no, no!\" Tears began to streamndown her face just as perpetually as the blood seemed to flow downnher husband's. \"Korben,nno! Korben, no!\" Leeloo cried when she noticed the problem. Zorgncontinued to rock insanely on the chair and Lily-Ray suddenlynwondered if he was getting sick too. \"Uhnoh, another. There's another,\" he muttered sadistically. \"Zorgnwell? Zorg well?\" Leeloo said as she approached him cautiously.nZorg's head shot in her direction. \"Leeloo,nwatch them for a moment, I'm going to call the doctor!\" Lily-Rayncried as she ran into the kitchen. \"Yes,\"nLeeloo said as she sat Korben down on the couch. \"Korben benalright. Well and healthy?\" She said with a cute smile that Korbenncouldn't help but grin at. \"L-Leeloo,\"nhe muttered as she laid him down, getting blood all over Zorg'snsofa. \"Hownmany more? How many more? How many more?\" Zorg began to mutter fromnhis place on the chair while simultaneously rocking insanely back andnforth. \"Shensays she'll be over immediately,\" Lily-Ray said nervously as shenwalked back out into the living room. She sighed when she noticednKorben dozing lightly in Leeloo's arms. \"Korbennbe okay? Healthy and well?\" She asked his wife. Lily-Ray nodded. \"Inhope so,\" she said as she sat down on the arm of the loveseat andnstrung her arms around Zorg who shrieked and pushed them away. \"It'snokay, it's alright,\" she assured him as she held him tighter andnrocked with him. \"Nonmore, another. No more, no more,\" he muttered as Lily-Ray strokednhis hair. \"It'snalright, we'll get him fixed, it's okay,\" she said as morentears escaped her eyes. She looked at Leeloo who was wiping morenblood off of Korben's face with the tissues. Then she turned andnlooked at Zorg whose eyes were so bloodshot that they looked almostnsolid red. \"Oh no,\" she muttered as a knock sounded from thendoor. She was kind of wondering why he was seemingly losing it.nLeeloo stood up and ran over to it. \"Doctorsnhelp, Zorg says doctors help!\" She cried as Dr. Alessa and a fewnEMTs ran in with a stretcher. \"We'rengoing to take you all to the hospital. We didn't know if any of younwere infected, but apparently so,\" she said as she lifted Korbennonto the stretcher with the help of the young EMTs. \"Doctor,nI think he's sick too,\" Lily-Ray said as she pointed to Zorg whonwas glaring around the room with eyes like blood. \"Ohnno, Mr. Zorg,\" the doctor muttered as she commanded the EMTs to gonand get another stretcher. \"Thanks…nI love you guys too,\" Korben muttered with a smile from his placenon the stretcher as one of the EMTs wheeled him out followed bynanother who was going out to get another gurney. Lily-Ray waitedninside with Zorg and Leeloo while the other EMT came back in with thenwhite bed on wheels. \"Helpnme,\" Dr. Alessa said as she took Zorg's good arm and tried tonlift him onto the stretcher. Lily-Ray grasped his waist and liftednhim the rest of the way up. \"No!\"nZorg screamed madly as he flipped himself off the stretcher. \"Thisnis bad,\" the doctor said. \"Whatndo you mean?\" Lily-Ray asked nervously. She was already too worriednabout Korben. What next?\" Dr. Alessa sighed as she watched Zorgnback away from her. \"Thenvirus only seemed to affect the body at first but it seems that it'snalready mutated into a encephalitic disease… a disease of the brainnas well as the body,\" the doctor relayed all she knew. Lily-Raynsighed. \"Ohnno,\" she muttered as she looked at Zorg who now resembled a rabidnanimal as he backed away from them, down on his hands and knees fromnhis fall off the gurney. \"Comennow, Mr. Zorg. We must bring you to the hospital, we can make you allnbetter,\" Dr. Alessa tried. She would try not to admit it but shenhad a strange admiration for Zorg and she was so very afraid ofnlosing him. \"Okay, I'm going to tell the EMTs to bring Mr. Dallasnto the hospital. Leeloo I want you to stay and help me but Mrs.nDallas you can go with your husband. Have them send for anothernambulance for when I get him sedated,\" she said. Lily-Ray nodded asnshe ran frantically out the door. \"Korben!\"nShe cried when she saw him lying motionless on the gurney with bloodnsurrounding him. \"Dr. Alessa says to just take us to the hospital.nShe says call for another ambulance because it is going to take her anwhile to get Mr. Zorg,\" Lily-Ray explained to the EMTs. The onenwith the blonde hair nodded and climbed into the driver's seatnwhile the other pushed Korben into the ambulance and got into thenback with him ad Lily-Ray. \"It'snokay Korben, it's okay,\" she said to him as she stroked his hair. \"Where'snLeeloo? And Zorg?\" Korben muttered quietly. Apparently unlike Zorg he still had his senses… \"They'renback at the house. Dr. Alessa's going to bring them in a bit. Fornnow they just want to make sure you're okay. Don't worry, Zorgnand Leeloo will be fine,\" she tried to convince her husband. \"It'snso dark,\" he muttered before coughing up blood. \"Korben,\"nLily-Ray cringed and helped the EMT wipe the blood from her husband'snface. \"What do you mean dark?\" \"Dark,ndark. So dark,\" he muttered before passing out. \"Korben!\"[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten: The Only Hope There'sna song that's inside of my soul It's the one that I've tried tonwrite over and over again I'm awake and in the infinite cold But You sing to me over and over and over again So Inlay my head back down And I lift my hands And pray to be onlynYours I pray to be only Yours I know now You're my only hope -Switchfoot: Only Hope \"Come on, come here,\"nDr. Alessa reached out and tried to grab Zorg's arm as he backednaway and hid behind a bookcase. Leeloo sat nervously on the loveseatnas the doctor had told her to. \"Comenhere! I've got you!\" Chantal cried as she tried to poke hernlittle brother's arm. He would be 'it' if she could get him…nbut he was so damn fast. \"Casimir!\" She laughed as she chased himnaround the yard. He slid between two trees and she couldn't reachnhim. \"Come out here you silly boy!\" She laughed. \"Comenout here, Mr. Zorg. I need to get you to the hospital, please,\" Dr.nAlessa pleaded. Zorg shook his head no with a mysterious glint to hisntired eyes. He was pulling something out of his mind… somethingnfrom long ago. He would not be caught. He would not be it. \"Gotnyou—huh?\" Chantal and her little brother looked up at a group ofnmen in uniforms running madly into their yard. \"Whonare they?\" The little boy with the straight black hair asked hisnsister quietly. \"Indon't know,\" the girl with the long, straight black hair answerednas she pulled her little brother closer to her. \"We'renlooking for Mr. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg,\" one of the men asked.nYoung Casimir recognized these men: they were wearing the samenuniforms that his father wore. They were the soldiers. Chantalnrecognized too… \"Henis in the house,\" she said as she followed the uniformed men intonher home with her little brother. \"Mr.nZorg?\" One of the soldiers said as he walked towards the man whonwas sitting on the sofa reading. When he noticed the men he looked upnimmediately. \"Yesnsir?\" He stood and saluted the man. \"Wenneed to again. You are being re-enlisted. This is desperate. The warnis getting worse by the minute and we are losing men fast,\" thenlead soldier said. Casimir's father nodded gravely and turned tonhis mother-less children. \"Wenneed to go to the battlefield,\" he said. They were to stay on thenreserve with him. They were to help.

He was strapped tonthe gurney and finally sedated. He was moaning something about anreserve… ………………………………………………………………………….. \"It's okay Honey,\"nLily-Ray said as the doctors administered an antiviral test-run intonKorben's muscular arm. He cringed when they did it. \"This should work,\" thentiny doctor said as he pulled the needle from Korben's arm. \"Wenhave been testing many things lately on hemorrhagic fevers and thisnseemed to work. It's a coagulant and it contains a medication thatnis related to Ribavirin…\" Lily-Ray didn't really understandnwhat the little man was talking about but if it would help hernKorben… \"W-where's Leeloo?\"nKorben rasped. \"Leeloo…\" \"It's okay, Love, it'snokay. Leeloo's okay. She's with Dr. Alessa,\" Lily-Ray said asnshe stroked Korben's short, short hair. \"With Zorg? She is withnZorg, isn't she? No! No!\" The tiny doctor shrieked when Korbennbegan to flail madly. \"Korben, dear, shhhhh.nIt's alright. It's alright. No, no, she is with the doctor. Mr.nZorg is coming in as well. He is also ill.\" She hated the satisfiednlook on Korben's face before he coughed violently. \"So I am not going to benthe only one who dies!\" He shouted aggressively. Lily-Ray cried. \"No! No! You are not goingnto die, Korben!\" She wailed as she leaned onto his chest. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………. \"Zorg no badaboom! Nonbadaboom!\" Leeloo cuffed a doctor angrily in the face as she foughtnher way through the crowd towards Zorg. He was sitting up on hisnstretcher looking curious. \"Leeloo! Stop!\" Dr.nAlessa shouted as she grabbed Leeloo's steel-like arms. \"He willnbe alright—you see, he is okay,\" she said as she pointed to thenman on the gurney. \"NO!\"nZorg roared as he pulled a Leeloo. The doctor gasped and held hisnbruised face. \"What the fuck is going on?\" He shouted. Dr.nAlessa pushed through the crowd of analytical doctors and touched hisnshoulder. She removed her hand when she heard Leeloo snort behindnher. \"You are cured. You gotnthe disease, but now you are better.\" \"H-how in all Hell didnthat happen?\" He asked as he slid one slender leg off of thenstretcher. He looked down and realized with slicing horror that henwas wearing a post-op gown. \"AAHHH!\" He pulled it tightly aroundnhis body as to close the back. \"You evil bastards!\" Henshrieked at the doctors. \"Mr. Zorg, please, comenwith me,\" Dr. Alessa led him and Leeloo away from the doctors andnER 30: the meeting room. \"No badaboom!\" Leeloonshrieked as they all sat down. \"Leeloo,ncome here,\" Zorg said, his thick accent never failing him. Shenwalked over to her dear with her arms crossed and a pouting looknabout her perfect features. \"I ain't gonna' go badaboom, ya'nhear? I am fine ,\" he attempted to convince her. She snorted. \"Leeloo love Zorg. Leeloonno want Zorg go BOOM!\" She threw out her arms in emphasis only tonknock him in the nose. \"Leeloo, watch thatnstrength of yours,\" he said before Dr. Alessa cleared her throat tonget the lot's attention. \"Oh right, the reason I'm alive.\"nThat got Zorg a strange look. \"Mr.nZorg, I understand that you are half-android, is this correct?\"nZorg nodded. \"Well that is exactly the reason you survived. Thenvirus can obviously not get into android-parts, so only half of you was ravaged. Since it was so little inside of you, the virusndissipated quickly. So you see, your human half is now immune to thenvirus, and you can withstand them for your mechanical half.\"nZorg nodded and pretended to understand. \"So that's why all themndoctors were crowded around me,\" he muttered. He still did notnfully comprehend it. Leeloo understood fully. Zorg understood aboutnas much as he understood about Korben's hatred for him: one thing.nHe knew that Korben hated him because he had Leeloo. He knew that henwas alive because he was half-android. The reason did not matter. \"Well thank you, Ma'am,nI guess I will be leaving then,\" Zorg said as he stood up. Leeloonslid off of his lap and stood happily next to him. \"No, no! You cannot gonnow. What of Korben? He is still ill. We need your help, since younare immune now. You need to help him, or else he could die,\" Dr.nAlessa pleaded. \"What the—what the Hellndo you expect me to do?\" \"We need you to donatensome of your blood to him. You have the antibodies in you to fightnthe disease. Perhaps it will help him if we were to donate some tonhim.\" \"Younwant me to help him?\" Zorg seemed surprised at thisnimplication. \"Yes. Look, I know therenis some sort of animosity between the two of you, but please, please.nIt is a matter of life and death,\" Dr. Alessa was now pleading.nZorg moaned and glanced at Leeloo who was staring at him withnbeseeching eyes. \"Please Zorg. Please Zorg.nI no want Korben die. Korben friend. Leeloo always love Zorg, but nonwant Korben die. No Korben Dallas die!\" She wailed as she clung tonthe front of his white gown. If it was not such a serious situation,nDr. Alessa might have found the picture of the handsome weaponsndesigner in a Johnny rather comical. Zorg sighed and strokednLeeloo's hair. \"Fine.

To be entirely honest, I'm not particularly positive where I planned on taking it…but enough about me! More about the story. I've decided to edit this and attempt to continue it, considering many people appeared to like it and my skill level has improved drastically since I began this fic. Thank you to everyone reading this, whether you're a new reader or an old one. One \"Ahmed, where are we going?\" I gaze around us at the strange scenery, the weird air tasting different in my mouth. The usual steady rock of my horse in the sand changed in this land, now uneven and uncomfortable. I would have given anything to turn our horses around and continued back to our home in Baghdad. \"To visit some old friends of mine in the North,\" Ahmed ibn Fadlan replied shortly, having answered this very same question upon multiple occasions. And, as I had done before, I answered with the same response. \"Northmen?\" I scrunched up my nose, curling my lips under in a pronounced frown of disgust. Not that I could be considered refined or distinguished; our parents always considered me the problem child in the family. No man wanted such a willful-spirited girl, and bowing down to an overbearing husband was nowhere on my agenda. When my brother returned from his journey to the North, I begged again and again to hear about his adventures. Most of them, I assumed he made up. Eaters of the dead? Monsters that dwell and prey in mist? Fanciful nonsense! The men he told me about did pique my interest, and I soon took to practicing with a sword in order to journey with him should he ever make the trip back to visit his friends from the North. Nobody mentioned the smell. \"Siara, you do not even know these men,\" Ahmed chided firmly, his hand rising to wipe a bead of sweat from his brow. My brother and I looked very much alike. We shared the same deep, brown eyes and rich hair, though mine cascaded in an unruly manner down my back to my waist. \"I shall enjoy visiting with Herger; it has been far too long since I met him.\" \"...What weird names they have in this part of the land, brother.\" I glanced over at him with a sly grin with full knowledge how agitated the sun made him. If anything, his mood would only worsen during our time in the North. Another whiff of something like stale water, and I scrunched up my nose. Ahmed didn't miss a beat. \"You're name is weird, as well.\" \"As is yours, Ibn!\" I giggled as my brother began to fume again with irritation. I ran my hand down the neck of my chestnut Arabian stallion, relishing the smooth texture of his hide, to calm him as he started to protectively shuffle at my brother's discomfort. \"Don't start hyperventilating, brother; the sun has already depleted your oxygen. Also, Night doesn't enjoy when you yell. He thinks you're angry at me when you raise your voice in that manner.\" \"Angry? I AM angry. Nobody's called me Ibn since I came back from the North! As for your horse, I could care less what he thinks,\" Ahmed snapped, but the small quirk of his lips betrayed his true emotions. If Ahmed had ever truly been furious at me, he had hidden it well. I laughed as Night reached down and began to chew on Ahmed's hair as penance for growing short with me. Night was much larger than my brother's horse and much stronger. I had owned him for three years, our father having won a bet and allowing me to pick out a stallion to call my own. I knew the way Night breathed and raced, what excited him or bored him, and how he got back at those whom threatened me, particularly Ahmed. Some time passed before I opened my mouth again. \"Are we there yet, Ahmed?\" We were already out of water. 'Oh, no,' Ibn had confidently assured me. 'This will be enough water. You worry too much.' I constantly worry too much because he never seems to worry enough! He seems to think that since he killed creatures that couldn't decide whether they were bears or humans that he can walk through fire! \"Will you stop complaining and just keep riding,\" he said, his breathing shallow, and he wiped away another layer of sweat. Long ago had he removed his keffiyeh and stowed it away in his saddle bag, and I could now see where his hair, free from moisture, took on a mind of its own and tried to reach away from his baking temple. I didn't want to think about what my own hair looked like. \"Ibn, we are going to die out here! I blame you for not taking care of me like you should...our poor, deceased mother is looking down upon you with shame...\" I shook my head at him in disgrace, and he glared up at me from the saddle of his shorter horse. \"We're almost there, Siara. Contain yourself.\" I followed Ahmed as he weaved through the foreign terrain, trying to grasp the basics of where he steered us. I barely recognized one tree from another, my mind was so confused. This land was so different from our home; I had to wonder how my brother had learned to navigate so easily with the little time he spent in this region. A little ways further, and my eyes widened. I finally saw the source of the odiously scented water. \"A river, brother? Where ever did it come from? Not even minutes ago, we treaded in the remains of the desert!\" Ahmed smiled at my naiveté, enjoying this far more than I felt he should. \"Come now. A little further.\" We rounded a bend, and I picked up another smell that I could not discern. If I didn't know better, I would have guessed sweat mingled with dirt masked the fresh air in a thick cloud of stench. My brother laughed at my expression, only beckoning me further into the unknown. Finally, we reached what I could only assume was a small encampment. The village, if I could call it that, contained only a few houses build sturdily out of wood. I could hear voices from inside, laughing merrily and chattering loudly enough to shake the building itself. Suddenly, these Northmen didn't sound so grand. \"Ahmed, is this it? Not very big, now is it?\" I gave him a wary glare, my lips turning downward as I wished for home, and not for the last time. \"Must you criticize everything, Siara?\" he questioned, a fond smile across his face as he gazed around at the tiny settlement. I stared at him in wonder at how pleased he appeared to be at the appearance of the village. Lost in some far off memory, he glanced at me with a distant gaze and absent command. \"Here, get down off of Night. He is probably tired from the expedition.\" I would have much rather stayed on my horse. In fact, I was perfectly comfortable remaining on my horse for the remainder of the visit with these warriors, but Ahmed would have no word of it. Reluctantly, I obeyed, and as I was swinging my leg over the saddle, my foot slipped through the loop of the reins. I leaned up, gripping the saddle as I attempted to unhook my ankle. \"In a bit of trouble?\" My brother laughed, dismounting his own horse so he could come to my aid. From the opposite side of Night, Ahmed reached up and took hold of my foot, holding it still in order to slip the reins over it. \"Must you be so infuriating, brother?\" I sighed, relaxing too soon. My grip, light due to the reins holding me up, slipped from the saddle, and flailed my arm out to grab at the saddle again. I missed, and winced, waiting to hit the ground, only to be caught by two of the strongest arms I had ever felt grasp my small frame; not even my father had been so sure of his own hands. He held me quickly, keeping me from landing in the mud, and set me down only when both of my feet could hold me soundly. I gazed up at him, struck by the bluest eyes I had ever seen. His long hair so blond it might be white framed a pale and war-worn face. His brow furrowed in concentration, eyes searching my face for any trace of recognition. Ahmed was the one to disrupt the two of us, his face pale as he looked upon the strange man, much like he might be a ghost. \"…Buliwyf?\" Welp, that's it for Chapter One. For those of you who read this before, you'll notice the subtle changes, such as the name. I suggest waiting until I have the next chapter finished before you carry on, wayward son. I'll try to get the next one done before the weekend. Until then, loves![Chapter 2] Okayz,nthanx to those who reviewed. Not many, but thanx. Please review.nThanx!!!!!! Plagued by thenMist I stared up at thenbeautiful, blue eyed man. He set me lightly on my feet.\"Bencareful.\" \"Yeah, sorry...\" \"Don't apologize.\" I felt my face flush. Henwas tall, taller than me, and had the most beautiful blue eyes I'dnever seen. Who was he? \"Buliwyf!!\" We both glanced at Ibn,nwho had gotten off his horse. He waled over to us.\"Buliwyf, it'snnice to see you again.\" Buliwyf nodded, thennturned his head back to me.\"Is this your woman?\" \"NO!!!\" Inshrieked.\"I'm his sister!!! Big Brother can't get a girl. Hensays his heart belongs to some woman named Olga...\" \"Lushia, that isnpersonal!!\" Buliwyf nodded,ncomprehending what we were saying.\"can you draw sounds as well?\" \"Draw sounds?\"nI repeated, thoroughly confused. \"She can. She justnis confused easilly.\" Ibn answered. Then he lookednaround.\"Buliwyf, where is Herger? And Heath? This place looksndeserted. Where is everyone?\" Buliwyf looked solemn. Atnfirst, it didn't seem like he would answer. then, he sighednheavily.\"You have come just in time, Ahmed. We have beennplagued.\" \"Plagued? Plagued bynwhat?\" I questioned. \"No...\"Ibnnwhispered.\"Not the Wendol again...Didn't we kill them? We killednthe Mother and the leader, didn't we?\" \"They found a newnMother and leader. Now they have come here with the intention tonrevenge those we did manage to kill. I fear we may not have a chance.nWill you help us, Ahmed?\" \"Of course. I willnhave to make arrangements to have Lushia taken back home. Do you havenany messengers?\" Ibn asked. Within two seconds, I hadnmy signature dagger pointed at my brother. His eyes widened, and Inswore I saw Buliwyf smile.\"You are NOT sending me home. Inrefues!! I'm not a child, Ahmed. You can't order me around anymore. Inmissed the action last time, now it's my turn. You think I'll let younhave all the fun? I don't think so.\" Ibn looked to Buliwyf,nobviously looking for help. i looked to him too, my eyes pleading.nhis beautiful eyes met mine, and my heart pounded. Then he smiled atnme. 'She can stay if she sonwishes.\" I smiled, but the serious look he had wiped it from mynface.\"You have to be prepared for the worst. The Wendol are nonordinary fiend. they feed on the dead. You've obviously heard thenstories from your brother. Are you prepared to fight for your life?\" I nodded.\"Yes, i am,nSir!!!\" '...Call me Buliwyf.\" \"Okay...Buliwyf.\" Ibn glanced back andnforth between us as we continued to keep our eyes locked. This wasnnot good. Didnyou like it? Please review if you did. i'd really appreciate it. AndnI know half of you knew it was Buliwyf all along..cuz ur all smartnlike that!!! okayz, thanks for reading!!! Please review!!![Chapter 3] To all of myndiligent readers…..I thank you dearly. I can only say it wasn'tnmy fault I haven't posted chapter three. My computer crashed, and Inhad no way of getting to a computer, so here I am, writing partnthree. Thank you SO much for the reviews. I could never thank younenough. I shall stop rambling now so you may read the story you allnseem to love so much. Thanks again!! Chapter Three Wendols—ThenAppearance!! I frowned as I watched Herger,nHeath, and Buliwyf all blow their noses in a bowl of water, and thennrinse their mouths. I felt like gagging, but I held back the urge. Inglanced at my brother, who chuckled at my mortified look. When Heathnshoved the bowl towards me, I shrunk back. \"Uhm, yeah, about that…nno thanks. I mean, don't take this as a personal insult ornanything, but…no, that would hurt their feelings…Well, younsee….no, and they would take THAT as an insult…\" I smiled.\"Y'nknow, that is VERY sweet of you, I think I'll wait until later,nthough, if you don't mind.\" Ibn laughed. \"Ignore her, Heath. She isn't used to the ways of the Northman.\" I could've sworn I saw Buliwyfnsmile as he chuckled, \"Not long ago, you were the same way.\" The hair on the back of my necknbegan to stand up. Call it a sixth sense, if you want to, but I KNEWnsomething bad was about to happen. I glanced around uncertainly. Thenmist slowly creeping under the door was what caught my attention. \"Ahmed!!\" I exclaimed, pointingnfrantically. Within two seconds, the other fournwarriors—Ahmed, Buliwyf, Herger, and Heath—were on their feet,nswords drawn. I, too, rose, two sharp daggers in my hands. \"So, little brother, do you stillnhave your girls' weapon?\" Herger asked, his voice teasing. \"Of course, why would I come herenwithout it?\" Ahmed said, acknowledging his saber. I frowned. The Wendols were uponnus, and they were conversing about their weapons. I would'venslapped some sense into them had the door not been thrown open. Mynworst fear was recognized as I stared at the bearskin clad hunters innfront of us. They charged in, aiming toward us. There were maybe six,nat the very least four. I blocked the sharp teeth of one, thennplunged my dagger firmly into its stomach. It howled—or made somensort of noise—and continued to lunge at me. I cut off one of itsnpaws as it swiped, aiming to take off my head. A sword from behindnwas shoved through it, and it slumped to the ground. I gaped atnBuliwyf, then glared. I could understand them thinking Ibn wouldnneed help—he needed help with everything—but I could take care of myself. I quickly turned, and saw mynbrother struggling against one of the Wendols. I rushed to his aid,nstabbing the demon three times, then shoving the dagger into his headnand pulling down, slicing through his entire body with one stroke.nBlood splattered from him, drenching my face. I felt wicked, and Inloved it. I glanced at Buliwyf, making sure he saw this. He raisednhis head slightly—disapproving, obviously— and continued to helpnHeath kill a Wendol. \"Ahmed, are you okay?\" I asked,ngrasping his shoulder. 'I'll survive. Don't worrynabout me right now.\" Was his answer. I rolled my eyes, causing him tonchuckle.\"Lushia, I'll praise you later; Just fight!!\" Soon we had finished off thenWendol. When we counted up the bodies, there turned out to be seven,nmuch to our surprise. I slid my daggers into my boots safely, thennrested my head against my brother's shoulder. He lovingly patted mynback before moving, causing me to stumble forward some. Hergernslapped me on the back. \"You did great!! Here; Have somenwine.\" I wrinkled my nose.\"No thanks…\" He laughed, then took a long drink. Buliwyf turned to me.\"You werenreckless out there. Women aren't meant to fight, due to theirnthirst to prove themselves.\" \"Really, now? What are women tonyou then, Buliwyf? A wench to sleep with who'll get you more winenand listen to your every command?\" I snapped. \"Lushia, please hush up…\"Ibnnmurmured in my ear. 'No, I will NOT 'hush up'!!\"nI screamed at him, my fury taking over. I glared back at Buliwyf, whonwas frowning at me with deep dislike in his eyes. \"Why do you thinknwe want to prove ourselves? It's due to the fact that younself-centered, egotistical men just use us for sex!! Face it, womenndo things better!!\" His fists clenched, and I thoughtnhe was going to slap me. Instead, he turned on his heel, leaving thentent with a quickened pace. I suddenly felt guilt overwhelm me.nPerhaps I had said too much? Did my hot temper get the better of menagain? No wonder I couldn't get a man. Herger suddenly burst out innlaughter, startling me.\"I can't believe you just told Buliwyfnoff!! He didn't even respond!! Normally, if someone talked to himnin that manner, they would face consequences. But lo!! He didn'tneven yell at you. What do you think, Heath? Do you think it meansnsomething?\" Heath nodded.\"Aye, I think itndoes.\" I frowned, holding my head high.\"nI don't care what it means.\" Then I sighed.\"I guess it would benbetter if I apologized to him, though…\" \"That's my little sister,\"nIbn chortled, gently propelling me to the door.\"You may gonnow;Don'y let any of us self-centered, egotistical men stopnyou.\" Before I could even utter ansyllable, I was shoved through the curtain door. I swallowed hard,nthen looked around for the blonde-haired man. Okay, that's all for now.nThanks to all of you who reviewed. Like I said earlier, I would'veninstantly wrote chapter three, but…yeah…stupid computer. Anywhoo,nplease review!! Part four will be out soon!![Chapter 4] Many thanks to all of you whonhave reviewed. I'm glad you all like this story!! Enoughnchit-chat, here's part four!! I'm gonna TRY to get a part outnevery weekend, but if I don't, please don't get angry!! Thanksnfor reading!! Chapter Four—Apologies I glanced around, my eyesnslowly growing accustomed to the bright sun. I had totally forgottennit was morning. Right now, that didn't matter. I had to findnBuliwyf. I scanned the encampment, searching for the tall blondenman. To my dismay, he was nowhere to be found. I trudged down tonthe water. There were a few boats docked, but nothing more. No signnof the sapphire-eyed warrior. \"You seem lost.\" His voice startled me. It wasnsmooth, like silk, and it sent a shiver up my spine. I spun around,nfacing Buliwyf. Well, not really facing. He was at least two headsntaller than me. I could hear the short jokes already….. \"There you are,\" I murmured. It didn't seem like a suitable sentence; but in my current state ofnmind, this was all I could think of. \"I've been looking for you…\"nYeah, for a total of five minutes. I was getting lamer by the minute. \"Were you? I could've sworn Injust saw you come out of the tent. You must give up easy. Where'snthe girl who just yelled at me in the tent?\" She's really sorry….Wouldnyou be able to forgive her, I wonder? I shifted uneasily,naverting my eyes to the ground where I could easily watch an antncarry a breadcrumb. Buliwyf continued to stare at me and I began tonfeel queasy. Why couldn't he look at the sky or something muchnmore interesting? Finally, I cleared my throat. \"Buliwyf, I came to apologize. Inshouldn't have said what I did back in the tent. I just…well, mynbrother says I have a really bad temper. I think he's right aboutnthat. I didn't mean what I said…\" I know you were justnconcerned for my safety…I didn't mean it…Please, Buliwyf,nforgive me… He frowned, his gazenunwavering.\" So you admit you were headstrong?\" \"…Yes…\" \"You embarrassed me in front ofnmy warriors. Do you know they will probably never be able to look atnme with a straight face again? Herger will never let me live thisndown now. \" \"I know…I'm really sorry,nreally, truly…\" Why did it seem to matter some much what Buliwyfnthought? Did I care that much of his opinion? I only met him today,nbut I feel so…. drawn to him, like the force of gravity wasnpulling me to him. I longed so deeply for him to look me in the eyesnlike he had when he first met me. Would he ever look at me like thatnagain now that he knew what kind of girl I was? Buliwyf sighed and rolled hisneyes.\"I guess I can't stay mad at you, can I?\" My head snapped up at him, and Insaw he was smiling. \"Thank you for your forgiveness…\" He looked out to the water,nobviously struggling with something. He sat down, and then pattednthe ground beside him. I inhaled and obeyed. We were silent for anminute. I glanced at him, expecting him to meet my gaze, but he didnnot. Instead, he kept his eyes on the water. Finally, he spoke, \"I have something to tell you.\" I looked up at him, my eyesncurious. \"What is it, Buliwyf?\" Oh-no!! Please tell me he'snnot going to go all romantic and profess his love or something!! This could get complicated…. He inhaled, as if he were preparingnhimself for something hurtful. I waited patiently, waiting for himnto meet my gaze with his gorgeous sapphire eyes. And he did, butnwhat came with it was something I had not been expecting. \"Lushia, I'm supposed to bendead.\" Yeah, that was unexpected. Okay, that's it for now!!nPlease review!! I'll have part five out soon!![Chapter 5] All right, I know I haven't added to this story in a long, long time. I'm sorry to say that my muse ran away and refused to come back. I'm pleased to say that I think its returned....Think being the operative word, of course. Thanks for those of you who've followed this from the beginning and to those who recently started. I'll try to keep writing in this as much as I can. Thanks again. Oh, and please review. Please? A Shocking Tale I stared at Buliwyf, eyes wide. Ibn had spoken of his endeavors with the Northmen many, many times, but never had he mentioned something so...so...well, absurd, for lack of a better adjective. The terrifying part was the look in Buliwyf's eyes, too. He was being uncannily serious about this. \"What do you mean? How are you supposed to be dead?\" I asked slowly, trying to give my mind enough time to regain itself before he began. \"I mean exactly that,\" he answered, turning his sapphire gaze to the water again. I pulled my knees up to my chest, clasping my hands around them. I felt unsettled, wavered. I'd never felt so unhinged in my entire life. \"Could you elaborate?\" Did I honestly want to know what he meant? I watched Buliwyf as he told the story that Ibn had spun so often before. It somehow sounded different coming from him. His voice was deeper than my brother's, more languid. He told me of the choosing of the warriors, of the journey across the sea. Of the \"drawings\" he watched Ibn perform, of Hrothgard's village. Of the Wendol plaguing it. I had never realized until that point that Ibn had edited his version of the tale. This retelling opened my eyes to the terrors of the Wendol. They were wretched, they were dangerous. Suddenly, Buliwyf's earlier concern made more sense, no matter how much I disagreed with it to the bone. Buliwyf ended with the same words that my brother always did. \"We fought one last battle with the intentions of taking them down with us. We were luckily victorious. With the death of their leader, the Wendol fled to the hills to forever hide in the fog. Until now, it seems.\" I frowned. I know all of this. What about the bombshell he dropped twenty minutes ago? \"Big Brother never told me that you were poisoned by the Mother. This poison was deadly, yes?\" Well, imbecile, of course it was deadly. It's poison. \"Yes, it was deadly. Moments after the Wendol fled, I died. My soul left my body, and my breathing ceased,\" Buliwyf confirmed. I furrowed my brow, taking all of this in. \"So...how is it that you sit here with me now? How do you live?\" \"The Angel of Death,\" said Buliwyf. \"When my body was burned in the fashion that we perform our funerals, my ashes were deposited into the sea. I reawakened here, on this very shore. I questioned our oracle about this. She claimed that the earth would not let me die, my duties were not yet completed. I did not realize what her words meant until the Wendol appeared here.\" \"And...what happens when your duties are completed?\" Something inside me feared this answer. \"...I do not know. Perhaps I shall die.\" Buliwyf looked at me now. \"You must understand this now. The Wendol are my responsibility to destroy. I do not wish to entangle you in this. You may stay, but I forbid you to fight.\" \" What!!?? \" I stood up, outraged. Buliwyf looked up at me calmly, obviously predicting this. Anger coursed through me, and I had half the mind to slice his head off, if I thought it would solve anything. \"How dare you think you can order me around!!\" Buliwyf stood up, and I had to turn my gaze upward to continue my furious glaring. \"It is my village. I can order you as you please.\" \"You do not own me,\" I growled through clenched teeth. \"I will not sit idly by when I can be of use. I left Arabia for that very reason. I will not tolerate--\" \" I will not tolerate an outspoken girl fighting my battles. You will listen, or I shall follow Ahmed's advice and send you back to the place where you came from.\" He was adamant. He apparently forgot who he was speaking to. I leaned up a little, narrowing my eyes. \" I will not obey you.\" He stared down at me with icy eyes, as hard as stone in his decision.\"Then prepare to return to your home.\" Without another word, Buliwyf walked past me. I turned, watching him continue up the riverside to the small hut where Ibn and his other warriors were. I crossed my arms, tapping my foot. \"I can't believe I apologized to him, lowering myself...He probably spun lies to decieve me, scare me. He's incorrect. I will not depart.\" If only I'd noticed the mist spiraling in soft layers at my feet. All right, that's the lot for right now. I hope you liked it. Please review. Thanks a lot for reading, and I promise to update soon. Ta-ta!![Chapter 6] This is actually not a new chapter, but an author's note! Yay! I'm sorry for the long period between updates. I wrote this when I was a freshman in high school, so the contents are incredibly…well, to put it nicely, it needs cleaned up. Therefore, I am going through and editing the chapters of this tale, and hopefully, I'll rediscover whatever plans I had for this. Thank you all for reading and reviewing through the years. The first chapter is now updated with the fully edited version. I hope you continue to like this fic, and I apologize again for the prolonged wait!

He gave her a slightrnsmile, \"this will protect you from most of Max's powers and itrnwell tell you if he's near. Because knowing him he will come afterrnyou. So this will protect you if he ever comes after you and I'mrnnot there for you.\" He said as he faïenced it around her neck.rnIt was now near dusk and the sunset shone beautifully on the water ofrnthe pond. The two sat side by side watching as the sun set. Over thernlast few months since the final magic show their relationship hadrngrown beyond believe. As the last of the suns rays left Danny turnedrnto her, \"You should probably be getting back see you soon.\" Hernsaid smiling as he kissed her forehead. That had been about a monthrnago and Danny hadn't sent for her in all that time. Allyson knewrntheir feelings for each other had to stay as hidden as possible, butrnis was very difficult to do. It was a warm summer day as Allyson walked to school.rnShe couldn't believe that Danny had just forgotten about her, butrnevery time she tried comminuting with Danny telepathically he wouldrnalways say he was busy at the moment. She sighed heavy, she knew itrnwas important for him to get his magic stronger, but still she missedrnhim terribly. As she sat down at her desk she felt something fallrnfrom her purse. She bent down and picked it up smiling. It wasrnDanny's protection necklace. It wasn't that big of a deal, but itrnwas to her. In the middle of the chain was a big ruby red heart, butrnthe color was dulled from age and the golden chain just resembled anyrnother golden chain in the world. She sat there and put it around herrnneck somehow feeling closer to him then she had that whole month. Asrnthe bell rang a girl came up behind her, \"Hey Al. what have yournbeen doing lately I haven't seen you in months,\" her friendrnPhoebe asked. Alyson looked at her friend and smiled, \"I've beenrnbusy lately homework and everything.\" Phoebe sighed and went backrnover to her desk. Allyson looked out the window, 'now I sound justrnlike Danny,' she thought as class began. Strangely their teacher seemed to running late. 'Butrnshe never has been absent before,' Allyson thought as she got up torngo get a book from the back of the room. Phoebe laughed joyfully,rn\"Yeah, now we don't have class…yeah…yeah…yea.\" Shernstopped abruptly when she saw a man standing in the door way. The manrnhad brown hair and dull almost grayish eyes. Something inside madernAllyson uneasy about this man, but she let it pass, it was probablyrnanother longing to see Danny moment. \"Hello I'm going to be yourrnnew substitute teacher Mr. W. Your teacher left plans for you so whyrndon't you guys start working on it.\" He said warmly. As he handedrnout the sheets of work Allyson looked at him hard to try to see whyrnhe made her feel so uneasy. Yet, she couldn't find anything on thernsurface. While she did her work, which only took her about tenrnminutes to do she tried contacting with Danny again. When herrnthoughts reached his he said, \"I'm busy Ally leave me alone dornyou what Max to find me?\" That was weird his thoughts had soundedrnclose, much closer then they normally were. \"Miss Miller may I have your paper please?' Mr. Wrnasked kindly. She nodded still lost in her own thoughts. After classrnshe went over to his desk and asked, \"A… Mr. W actually where isrnMrs. Mitch anyway?' He looked up from his papers and looked at, andrnshe felt heat rising in her body as he stared at her. \"She left onrna business trip Miss Miller is that ok with you,\" he said calmlyrnShe nodded still a little unsure, but she lat it be for now. Thatrnnight she tried once again to talk to Danny. She needed his advicernabout what to do about Mr. W, but he didn't answer. \"He must bernasleep' she thought feeling hopeless.[Chapter 2] Pagern5 of 5 I forgot last time none of these charators are mine. Only the plot is mine. Hope ypu enjoy this chapter Over the next few weeks Mr. W had became very strangernalmost something he wouldn't talk about to anyone, but sometimesrnAlyson could catch just few words of what he would say when the kidsrnwere working or reading. 'Where is… I have to …\" When he didrnthough his few words didn't make much sense to her, she would tryrnto help him. During these times she was able to push Danny to thernback of her mind and she was somewhat glad because Max hadn't comernaround at all lately. Or so she thought. One day during lunch she was just going to the libraryrnwhen she heard voices coming from Mr. W's classroom. All toornfamiliar voices. Quiet as a mouse she leaned against the wall andrnpeeked into the room. There was Mr. W sitting at his desk, gradingrnpapers and there was Paul standing against the wall. \"Well whatrnnews do you bring,\" Mr. W asked. Paul smirked, \"First lasts justrnsay I've been able to keep him preoccupied. what about you any luckrnwith the girl?\" Mr. W stood up shaking his head, \"No I stillrncan't find out where he is from her and if she found out the truthrnshe would weather die then tell me.\" Paul looked up at the windowrnand saw her, \"Well I think now would be a good time she's rightrnoutside.\" Mr. W spun around glaring in pure hatred at her. Alysonrnjumped down and began to run down the hall as fast as she could, butrnknow sooner had she taken the first few steps, she felt herselfrnbecoming dizzy and finally darkness overcame her. When she woke up she found herself lying on a stew bedrnin the middle of one of the rooms in the magic mansion. Shernremembered it from when she and Danny had found it after the showrnthat night. \"Well I see your finally awake Allyson.\" A voice saidrncoolly. She stood up, but couldn't make herself move. 'a…rnwhat's going on?' she asked herself looking around. Suddenly fromrnout of the shadows Mr. W appeared smirking. \"What you are doingrnhere Mr…\" realization hit her like a bomb, \"Mr. Wizard?' ( bad name I now but I couldn't come up eith anything really good) shernsaid a little scared now. His smirk grew wider, \"Actually Allyson Irnproffer Max.\" he said transforming back into his old self. Sherncould do nothing but star at him, \"What do you what Max? If you'rernlooking for him he's not here and I haven't seen him since thernnight of the final competition.\" Max moved closer to her, \"Ohrnreally is that why you kept on calling to him in class am I right.\" She tried once again to speak, \"Yes, but he hasn'trntalked to me in awhile soon to bad for you.\" Max smirked, \"Ohrnreally did it sound like this'\" and Allyson suddenly heardrnDanny's voice in her head, \"Allyson I'm busy leave me alone.\"rnIt sounded so close this time and then she figured it out. \"Yournwere the Danny I kept hearing in my head.\" She fall back down onrnthe bed a wondered and angered look on her face, \"But then whatrnabout Danny?\" Max shook his head, \"Don't worry I haven'trnfound him yet, but\" he was now standing over her, \"if you wouldrnlike to save me the trouble.\" Allyson looked up at his face andrnspat right in his eye and yelled, \"Never.\" Max smiled and it wasrnalmost amusement type of smile that creped her out way to much. \"Irnfigured that would be your answer, but there are ways to changernthat,\" he said as he raised his hands and sent an energy ball startrntowards her hitting her right in the stomach causing her to fallrnunconscious. Max stood over her smirking, 'this is way to easy soonrnthey'll both be out of my hair,' he thought. Danny was sitting on the park bench deep in thought. Hernhadn't heard from Allyson in over two months now. And thanks tornPaul he had been to busy to semen her to him. He sighed, 'Oh Al Irnhope you're ok' he thought as he watched the swans float on thernwater. He sat there thinking about the last time they had satrntogether watching the sun set. He gazed up at the sky praying for herrnsafety. Alyson woke up feeling beyond hungry her stomach achingrnfrom lack of food, ever since her capture Max had gone out of his wayrnto find Danny more than ever before. Trying to stop the pain she heldrnher hand to her stomach, when Max came in. She tried to stand but herrnlegs were too weak now. Sitting back down she stared at and saidrnscantily, \"What do you what?\" Max smirked as he held out a smallrnplate of bred and a glass of water, \"Are you hungry?\" She didn'trnlook at him, but nodded. He bended down next to her saying coolly,rn\"You know this would all end if I knew where Danny was.\" Even inrnthis weak sate she said nothing and kept her eyes on the floor.rnSeeing that he wasn't getting anywhere and becoming annoyed at herrnhe sent a small shot of energy at her. This caused her to fly backrninto the hard wall behind her, but she would not say anything thatrncould harm Danny's life. \"Fine, maybe tonight then and here'srnsome food for you.\" He said as he tossed the plate at her andrnslammed the door behind him as he left. Meanwhile Max was in his chamber pacing up and down whenrnPaul came in. \"Why are you feeding her and keeping her alive…she'srnnot talking?\" Paul said sitting down at a table. Max turned on himrnsharply, \"You think me stupid or something I have my reasons forrnkeeping the brat a live for now.\" Paul raised an eyebrow, \"wellrnyou didn't do anything to her before and he got away last-\" \"Of cause I didn't do anything because I didn'trnknow her to be a threat and now that I know what she is I'll berntwice as powerful as before,\" Max said smirking. \"What do you mean?\" asked Paul a little scared ofrnthe fire in Max's' eyes. Max didn't respond, but simply leftrnhim in total confusion.[Chapter 3] Pagern6 of 6 Danny's eyes snapped open, his mind racing at toprnspeed. Something was definitely not right. It wasn't like Ally tornnot contact him at least once a month. \"Unless she can't,\" hernthought. With that thought in mind he leaped to his feet andrnteleported to her house. Her parents were sitting at the kitchenrntable staring at the phone. Danny stepped inside and gave a slightrnknock on the wall. Her mother looked up and cried, \"Have you seenrnAlly?\" He shook his head sadly and said, \"I was hoping that yournhad and she had just been grounded or something.\" Her mother wailed saying, \"No we haven't seen orrnheard from her about month and she never came home one day fromrnschool, we thought she was with you.\" Again he shook his headrncausing her to wail even more. Suddenly an idea came to him and hisrnanger started to steam. \"Max,\" he muttered throw clenched teeth.rn\"What did you say Danny?\" asked Ally's father, who had came uprnbehind him. \"Oh…nothing sir. I have to go I'll see you laterrnand call if I find out anything. Good bye Mr., Mrs. Miller,\" as hernslipped out of the door. When the door closed he disappeared andrnreappeared in seconds before the magic mansion, but something wasrnwrong. He couldn't get into the building. There was some kind ofrnfield around it that he couldn't get though. \"Probably Maxrnagain,\" he muttered as he tried and failed again to get though. Yetrnhe did know one thing for sure Ally was definitely inside with Max.rnHe only prayed he would reach her in time before Max hurt her. Butrnhow?[Chapter 4] Pagern7 of 7 Allyson lye spread across the mattress as Max enteredrnthe room. She was just, just beginning to wake up. Max smirked, herncould feel Danny's' presence outside, but there was nothing herrncould do to stop him now. Crouching down he drew a box from hisrnpocket. He gazed down at Allyson's sleeping form and smirked as hernopened the box. Allyson's eyes flattered opened just in time to seernMax place something on her finger. She tried to grab her hand free,rnbut she was to weak and his grip was very strong. She felt ice coldrniron, slip onto her finger as if it was a ring. As if Max could hearrnher thoughts he said slyly, \"yes it is in deed a ring, a veryrnspecial ring.\" Seeing that she didn't understand were he wasrngoing at he twisted her hand so that she was looking straight at it.rnThe Ring had a dark red jewel with a letter on it, but she couldn'trnmake it out, her eyes were to tired. Yet, she recognized instantly.rnIt was the ring Max had tricked Danny into wearing, the ring thatrnstole a magicians powers! Was now on her finger glinting in the lamprnlight above her. She gasped, \"It can't be.\" \"It can in deed be it Allyson,\" Max said as hernwatched her star at the ring with pure terrier and slight confusionrnon her worn out face. Turning to him she asked trying to stay calm,rn\"What was the point of this?\" Max glared at her and said, \"You'll see soon enough,rnbut know why don't we go see your boyfriend I know he's dying tornget in here.\" Allyson tried to stop him, but he hit her over thernhead. She felt a light tingle of blood rundown her back, beforerndarkness over took her.[Chapter 5] Danny tried once more and was able to get it though.rn\"That was almost to easy,\" he thought as he slowly made his wasrninside. As he walked along the corridors all the memories of thernGreatest kid Magician contest came flooding back to him. Hernshuddered as he thought about the fight he and Allyson had had, justrnbefore she was kicked off the show. And she had been right the wholerntime. If he ever saw her alive again he would do everything in hisrnpower to express how truly sorry he was for not believing her fromrnthe beginning. Turning down another hallway he realized he hadn'trneven be concentrating on where he was going. It was as if his feetrnand heart knew exactly where Allyson was kept prisoner. Nowrnconcentrating he realized he was standing in the very room, in whichrnAlly had said he had spied on him and Max that night Max tricked him.rnSlowly getting up on a chair he peeked though the vent and saw Maxrnsitting in one of the big chairs at the head of the table. Paul camernin and said, \"everything's ready sir.\" \"Perfect,\" Max said grinning, and then he waved hisrnhand dismissing Paul. When Paul left the room Max turned around inrnhis chair so that he was facing the fireplace. Danny nearly jumped down from the chair and ran from thernroom towards Max's chamber. What ever Max had in mind it couldn'trnbe any good. Running at top speed he reached the door in only a fewrnseconds. He didn't even knock, using his powers he blow the doorsrnopen, so that the doors shook the walls when they made contact.rn\"Where is she?\" Danny yelled at the top of his lungs. His angerrnnow focused on Max. \"I was wondering when you were going to getrnhere,\" Max said sarcastically as he turned around to face him. The room was all dark, except the two far ends of thernroom, where Max and Danny stood. \"Why is the light this way?\"rnDanny asked quickly glancing around the room. Max smirked and said,rn\"Are you looking for something?\" Danny turned sharply to him andrnyelled once more, \"Where is Allyson?\" \"Oh I'm glad you asked,\" Max said and clapped hisrnhands. Lights sprung on raveling a bed in the center of the room. Onrntop was a figure covered in white. Her blond hair was faded and herrnpure crystal blue eyes dulled slightly as if pain was spreading overrnher whole body. Yet nothing seemed to be wrong like rape, butrnsomething was differently not right. Danny run towards the figure, but was stopped with arnstrong force field surrounding the bed. Allyson turned her headrnslightly and called out in a voice barely above a whisper, \"Danny.\"rnShe then collapsed into unconscious once more. Danny slowly got tornhis feet and turned towards Max, his eyes blazing with a new fire hernhad never felt towards anyone in his hole live. \"What have you donernto her, you monster…No you Davil.\" Max smiled again and said, \"The only thing that isrnhappening is that your dear Ally is doing to die soon and theirsrnnothing you can do about it\" \"What do you mean?\" Danny said as he stared down atrnhis girlfriend. \"Daniel, have you not noticed what your sweetheartrnis wearing on her finger,\" Max said as if he was tried of playingrnaround. Danny stared intently and in mere seconds his eyes found thernring. Danny shook his head and stared at Max utterly confused, \"Whatrnis that thing doing to her?\" Max simply laughed, \" Do you not remember what Allysonrntold you about that ring and what it does.\" \"But she's not…she couldn't be,\" Dannyrnstammered unable to say the word that was purged on his lips. Max'srnsmile grew as he nodded, \"She good in deed be what you believe herrnto be.\" Danny shook his head as tears streamed down his face now.rn\"She couldn't be…isn't…a witch.\"[Chapter 6] Note, the flash back is taken from the movie by Disney channal. Max simply nodded.rnDanny stared down at Allyson's sleeping form, his vision nowrnblurrier by tears. \"Now, now Danny don't worry all the ring isrndoing is draining her energy and Magic,\" Max said moving aroundrntowards him. Danny shook his head and glared at max, \"but if thatrnwas true why didn't it work that quickly with me?\" Max glancedrndown and stroked her hair staring at the ring. \"You see after yourrnescape that time I new the ring needed more power, so I minified thernpower to five times, which it takes only mere two hours, before thernpower is ripped from the body and sucked into the ring.\" Danny couldn't take anymore and shut a chair at max,rnbut he dodged out of the way. As he stood up he laughed evilly \"Yournstupid brat, don't you get it the only the reason you were able tornbeat me the first time was because of that brat,\" he spat as hernpointed towards Allyson. \"But, how?\" Danny asked slowlyrnmoving towards Ally. Max laughed again, \"Do you not remember what Irntold you about wizards…every generation one or TWO magical peoplernare born with extraordinary powers.\" Danny moved towards Ally, butrnthe force field still held him back. Max said, \"You still don'trnget it do you. Allyson's magic is in her mind and that's' whyrnshe was so smart and why she really knew what you had came here for.\"rnDanny gawked at him as he remembered what Allyson had said to himrnjust before she was left the mansion. Flashback: Allyson, \"Safe it okrnyou had your chance to speak up and you didn't\" Danny, \"Speak up aboutrnwhat, alright you said you had proof, but you didn't. You claimrnthat Max is out to get, but don't know how are why, I mean how wasrnI supposed to believe you.\" Allyson said nothing, sornDanny continued trying to get her to understand. Danny, \"Besides yournhave no idea how happy I've been lately, felling…like a normalrnkid for the first time, in, in years…I mean it's the only thingrnI've ever wanted\" Allyson cutting him off,rn\"That's interesting,\" tears coming to her eyes, \"because ifrnyou wanted my opinion I think what you really came here searching forrnwas to find someone who could except you as you are, and be yourrnfriend.\" With that she left with Danny running after her. Yet shernonly replied, \"Wow, look at this your last great trick managing tornmake your only alley disappear.\" End of flashback Max smirked and said, \"Yes Danny, don't think that Irndidn't hear all your conversations with her,\" the fire is eyesrnwere sparking, \"Now Danny lets' finish this game with outrninterference this time.\" With out warning Max sent an energy ballrnright at him. Danny jumped back, but not before it gazed hisrnshoulder. They kept firing for what seemed like a long time, and thenrnonce Max hit the lever that kept the force field on. \"No,\" Max screamed as the force field disappeared.rnDanny quickly ran towards Alyson and pulled the ring off her finger.rnWhispering he said, \"Ally, please wake up please.\" Just then her eyes flattered open and she gave a weakrnsmile up at him. \"Hey, Danny,\" she said her voice still barelyrnabove a whisper. Danny was about to say something when he saw Maxrnfiring a fire ball towards them. Covering Allyson with his own bodyrnDanny sent her a mental massage. \"Ally, we have to beat Max do yournthink you're up for it?\" \"I think so, but what are you going to do?\" shernasked back mentally. \"It's not me, it's what we're going torndo, just take my hand and focus your hatred all on Max.\" She nodded, but Max spoke up, \"you think you can beatrnme brats.\" Danny sat back up and took her hand in his. Allysonrnusing most of her effort pushed herself up on her elbows and staredrnat Max. Holding each others' hands power surged through them.rnCreating a ball of pure white light that came out of their hands andrnwent start at Max. The light hit him and the light expanded allrnaround the room. After a few seconds the light faded and they werernalone. \"Did we do it?\" asked Allyson mentally. Danny was about tornsay something when a voice broke out from behind them. \"You mayrnhave won this battle, but trust me I will win the war,\" Max shoutedrnas he disappeared. Danny stared at the spot where Max had just stoodrnunable to think or do anything. Suddenly he felt a pull on his hand and turned around.rnAllyson had collapsed once again. Thinking quickly he picked her uprnand teleported away from there. All the while thinking desperately,rn\"Ally you can't die, you just can't. I won't allow it tornhappen, ever.\"[Chapter 7] Allyson awoke to a dimly lit room with white all aroundrnit. The last thing she remembered was a blinding white light andrnfeeling Danny's warm hand clasped in her own. Danny, where was he.rnTurning her head slowly she saw Danny sleeping in an arm chair arnbandage raped over his right shoulder. She felt much better, butrnstill a little unsteadied. Pushing herself up right she reached overrnand touched his arm gently. Almost instantly Danny woke up staringrninto her blue eyes. Seeing her he cried out, \"Oh, Allyson I thoughtrnyou were going to die, I'm so sorry- I never meant for any of thisrnto happen I-\" She cut him off as she put her finger to his lips. \"It'srnalright Danny, how could you have now. I'm fine now really,\" shernsaid as she sat up in bed. Just then a doctor came into the room.rn\"Ah, Miss Miller I see your awake. How are you feeling?\" Allysonrnshifted her gaze from Danny to the doctor and said politely, \"I'mrnfeeling much better thank you sir, but out of interest whatrnhappened?\" The doctor stared at her unsure of weather it would makernsense to her or not. Finally he said, \"You were found uncounios inrnan alleyway. It seemed you had a great deal of an energy lost, I'mrnnot quite sure how, but from my reports now you seem to have regainedrnmost of your energy back.\" \"How long have I been here?\" she asked as her gazernshifted towards the bright window on the far side of the room. Therndoctor sighed saying, \"You've been here for about four days andrnif you had kept losing energy at that same speed for two more hoursrnyou would have died.\" Allyson gulped, but nodded. The doctor turned hisrnattention towards Danny. \"Sir, I understand you're her boyfriendrnand that you also had some trouble in that alleyway also.\" Dannyrncould only nod. Once again the doctor sighed and said, \"and am I tornunderstand you can't remember anything.\" Danny scratched his head, \"No sir, all I remember wasrna bully was hurting her and I tried to stop him, and he used fire tornburn my shoulder and then he ran off, but it was to dark to see hisrnface.\" The doctor nodded and said, \"Well, thank you both forrnyour time and you'll be free to go today, good afternoon.\" Afterrnthe doctor left Allyson turned towards Danny and asked, \"so whatrnreally happened?\" \"Nothing Ally honest,\" he said. She raised anrneyebrow clearing saying 'yeah right'. 'Alright I've caughtrnme,\" Danny said and he began to explain very thing from him notrnhearing from her in a month and his fight with Max and how they endedrnup here in the hospital. Ally shuttered and asked, \"But why did Maxrnput that ring on my finger?\" She had been asking this more tornherself than to him, but Danny answered anyway. \"Ally, hm he put that ring on your finger to get yourrnpowers like he did to me\" \"But then I would have to be a witch,\" Allyson saidrngazing at Danny. He nodded, but her reaction was not what he expectedrnat all. She simply said, \"Alright, ok that's cool and it makesrnsince now actually.\" Danny leaned forward in his chair and asked,rn\"What did you say Ally?\" Ally stared deep into his eyes and said, \"yeah it doesrnmake sense. I mean I always had trouble making friends and I wasrnsmarter than the smarted people in my grade, but nothing strange everrnhappened to me, so I didn't really pay much attention to it.\"rnDanny stared at her in shock, but then laughed, \"You are quick tornexcept differences.\" She chuckled softly and asked, \"Can we leavernI hate hospitals.\" He nodded and then whispered in her ear I knowrnjust the place and with that he picked her up and teleported themrnaway.[Chapter 8] They reappeared in Danny's secret valley. Gentlyrnplacing her down on the bench and sat down next to her. \"So do yournwant me to tell you want really happened,\" Danny asked unsure. Shernshook her head and said, \"no, I think I would weather not know therndetails and besides I think I have a pretty good idea anyway.\"rnSighing she leaned against his chest and said, \"I love you Danny.\"rnDanny was taken aback at first, but stroked her hair and whispered,rn\"I love you too Ally,\" as he gently placed a kiss on herrnforehead. Allyson pushed herself upright again and said, \"but whatrnabout Max, he's still out there\" \"Don't worry Allyson. It'll be alright I swear tornyou he will regret what he did you,\" Danny said as he brushed awayrna tear rolling down Ally's face. Allyson sighed gazing down at thernground saying, \"I love you Danny, I couldn't imagine a life withrnout you.\" Danny placed a finger under her chin and lifted her chinrnuntil they were at eyelevel. \"I love you with my whole heartrnAllyson Miller and I would give my life for you. I love with so much\" \"Me too,\" Ally said gazing deep into his dark bluerneyes. Gently they pulled each other into a long passionate kiss andrnnothing could tare them a part ever again.

En tanto en el área de maternidad Leeloo Dallas despertaba completamente asustada rápidamente se levanto de la cama y camino desesperadamente a la sala de incubadoras donde su hijo se encontraba, en el camino se encontró con el padre Vito Cornelius que la miro preocupado y sorprendido. - Niña como es posible acabas de dar a luz adonde piensas ir… piensa en tu salud no es bueno que hagas esto-. El padre le iba diciendo mientras Leeloo caminaba sin hacer caso a lo que el padre decía. Cuando llegaron a la sala de incubadoras entro y busco a su hijo pero la interrumpió el sonido de los disparos que se acercaban a donde ellos estaban. - ¡Dios vendito que fue eso! -. Gritó el padre Leeloo vio que en la sala solo había cinco bebes levanto su vista y miro al clérigo. - Padre trajo lo que le pedí - ¡Ehh!… a si aquí esta…toma -. Dijo el hombre descubriendo su sotana en donde había una bolsa la cual le extendió. Leeloo tomo la bolsa miro a los bebes que dormían plácidamente a pesar de los gritos y disparos que se escuchaban afuera, ella sonrió tristemente, miro al techo para después dirigir su mirada al padre Cornelius que estaba entretenido viendo hacia afuera de la sala mientras escuchaba como los gritos y disparos se acercaban a la sala de incubación, aterrado cerro la puerta se giro viendo a Leeloo quien estaba colocando a el ultimo bebé que en la sala había dentro de un carrito de ropa sucia para después comenzar a llorar, acercarse al padre y abrazarlo diciéndole tristemente. - Por favor… cuide a mi hijo porque él será nuestra única esperanza -. Se acercó al carrito y lo empujo hacia donde estaba el padrecito, él levanto una sabana que tapaba al carrito viendo a las cinco niños que seguían durmiendo tranquilamente - Un momento donde esta lo que te traje - Ellos serán los guardianes hasta que llegue el momento en que la vida y la muerte sean una misma. El padre miro sin entender una sola palabra. - Quédese en este lugar y huya cuando los disparos de alejen… entendido Cornelius miro con desconcierto a Leeloo quien empezó a caminar con rumbo a la entrada de la sala de incubación - ¡ehhh!... a donde vas ¡espera!… que locura vas a cometer Leeloo cerro la puerta recargándose en ella, con sus manos seco sus lagrimas bajo la mirada cerrando fuertemente los puños, levanto su vista dirigiendo sus manos a su boca con la cual emitió un silbido que llamo la atención de las hombres armados, al instante siente hambres con trajes negros aparecieron frente a ella. - A mi es a quien buscan… ¡yo soy el quinto elemento! Los hombres miraron a Leeloo sorprendidos y de inmediato apuntaron sus armas a aquella mujer que se escondió dentro de una oficina que se encontraba a un lado de ella ya adentro espero pacientemente la entrada de aquellos sujetos mientras permanecía escondida con unas jeringas con agujas en las manos. Afuera los policías disparaban a diestra y siniestra luchando desesperadamente por intentar entrar al hospital pero el lugar estaba completamente protegido por los hombres de traje negro que no dejaban ni entrar o salir a nadie con vida. A lo lejos Korben Dallas buscaba la forma de entrar sin ser detectado o asesinado. Adentro del hospital lentamente la puerta de la oficina se abría dándoles la entrada a esos siete hombres armados con una pistola cada uno de ellos, eran robustos con lentes negros, cautelosamente buscaron al quinto elemento quien miraba desde un locker lo que sucedía cuando los tipos quedaron de espaldas al locker ella salió sigilosamente lanzando las jeringas que se enterraron en la espalda de cuatro de ellos que voltearon bruscamente buscando al agresor pero solo se encontraron con un baño de acido Sulfúrico que callo en sus cuerpos provocándoles gran dolor y que su carne se deshiciera, al igual que sus huesos. Los tres que faltaban voltearon a ver aterrados lo que ocurría con el cuerpo de sus compañeros y antes de poder disparar una hoja de bisturí con mango atravesó el pecho de cada uno cuando los sujetos cayeron muertos Leeloo levanto dos de las armas, salió de la oficina dirigiéndose a la sala de incubación abrió la puerta y vio al padre. - ¡Váyase!…-. Fue lo único que dijo para después dirigirse a donde se oían más disparos En la entrada Korben logro entrar después de haber estrellado su taxi en la entrada del hospital abrió la puerta de una patada la cual se llevo a unos hombres en sus trayectoria, en ese mismo instante Korben bajo rápido del carro disparando con un arma en cada mano mientras corría a la puerta del ascensor más cercano ya adentro presionó el piso 1439 y en seguida el elevador comenzó a subir a una velocidad impresionante. En el piso 1439 Leeloo caminaba cuidadosamente por los pasillos hasta que vio a dos hombres, rápidamente se escondió para no ser vista cuando los sujetos de distrajeron ella disparo matando a uno y a otro destrozándole la mano, camino rápidamente al tipo que aun estaba con vida y empezó a preguntar. - ¿Quiénes son y que buscan? Aquel hombre temblaba de miedo cuando vio los ojos de aquella mujer que lo miraba con odio, tembloroso solo pudo decir. - Eeeeste… mememe…mensaje… es… es para ti-. El hombre saco un recipiente de su pantalón y lo abrió ante la mirada de sorpresa de Leeloo. De aquel recipiente salieron unos gusanos blancos que enseguida se incrustaron en el cuerpo de aquel hombre y otros más llegaron al cuerpo de Leeloo entrando en ella, asustada soltó al sujeto que gritaba adolorido. En seguida ella empezó a sentir mucho dolor mientras los gusanos se dirigían a su cerebro, cuando llegaron ella comenzó a sentir más dolor rápidamente tomo una de las armas y la apunto a su cabeza... En las calles después de que el taxi se estrello en la entrada del hospital pudieron controlar la situación ya que los hombres comenzaron a huir y los policías mataban y arrestaban a los agresores que se habían quedado, enseguida decenas de uniformados entraron al hospital. El elevador había llegado al piso 1439 Korben salió mirando con horror lo que había en ese piso sangre por todas parte, personas heridas que no dejaban de gritar y llorar por el dolor que sentían y muertos ese lugar parecía el mismo infierno rápidamente Korben se dirigió a la habitación 54-A. Mientras tanto la sala de incubación el padre Vito Cornelius salió corriendo con el carrito de la ropa sucia y entro al elevador. En la habitación 54-A Korben no encontró a nadie asustado corrió a la sala de incubación donde tampoco encontró a alguien, desesperado camino entre los pasillos y comenzó a correr cuando vio a Leeloo que tenia un arma en su cabeza la cual estaba apunto de disparar, ella lo miro a los ojos tristemente gritándole: - ¡No te acerques!… Aquellas palabras lo detuvieron en seco e imponente vio como la mujer a quien tanto amaba se disparaba en la cabeza quitándose la vida, lentamente ella se desvaneció cayendo al suelo, Korben corrió desesperado levantando el cuerpo de su amada quien con su último aliento le dijo: - Adiós vida mía… te amo… cuida a nuestro…hijo… el será nuestra esperanza… cuando la línea entre la vida y la muerte desaparezcan. Korben mira atormentado el cuerpo que yace sin vida entre sus brazos mirando aquella marca que solo el quinto elemento posee, mientras que del cadaver caen gusanos como las sanguijuelas pero blancos convirtiéndose en polvo y otros más se meten en el cuerpo de él que abraza fuertemente a Leeloo y comienza a llorar aquel llanto llena el hospital con un terrible ambiente hasta que él siente que los gusanos han invadido su cerebro lo que le provoca un gran dolor que recorre todo su ser y comienza a gritar tambaleando toma la pistola con la que la mujer se disparo al instante siente como su propia mano trata de soltar el arma sin que él se lo ordene, con mucho esfuerzo logra que su otra mano tome el artefacto bélico y empieza a dirigirla hacia su cara pero extrañamente sus manos sin que se los ordene tratan de alejarse pero es más fuerte su voluntad y con mucha dificultad logra ponerla dentro de su boca para después disparar… el sonido del disparo recorre el piso para después el silencio absoluto y aterrador se haga dueño del piso. En las afueras de la ciudad en uno de los edificios, adentro en el departamento 666 se escucha que un teléfono suena desde la oscuridad alguien contesta: - ¿Qué ocurre? - El quinto elemento ha muerto - ¿Las piedras? - No lo sabemos… pero las encontraremos a tiempo-. Después el teléfono es colgado y el silencio se apodera de ese lugar. En el suelo del hospital San John en el piso 1439 yacen los cuerpos de dos héroes que dieron su vida para salvar el planeta. Mientras en la calle el silencio es roto por el llanto de unos bebes. Nota Final: Gracias por leerlo espero que sigas esta intensa y muy apasionada historia. Los capítulos se estaran publicando todos los martes.[Chapter 2] Hermosa Juventud Es el año 2284 la ciudad es un caos total aunque reine la paz el trafico es insoportable a pesar de que los autos pueden transportarse sin estar sujetos a una calle, los grandes edificios de más de 2000 pisos no son suficientes para poder albergar a toda la población del planeta y los cimientos de estas enormes megalópolis son lo que en un principio fueron las primeras ciudades y un enorme vacio divide estas ciudades contaminadas y llenas de oscuridad de las nuevas. En la ciudad No. 10 en la Tienda Departamental \"Campana Dorada\" que es la más grande de la ciudad un operativo policiaco es llevado acabo tres unidades de policías bien armados están dentro del edificio en el piso 581 donde están las cajas registradoras, las tres unidades están compuestas por 10 hombres cada uno de ellos está frente al gran mostrador de metal apuntando sus armas y el capitán del escuadrón dice: - ¡Arriba las manos en nombre de la ley!… baja lentamente tu arma y coloca tus manos detrás de la nuca… sino… ¡dispararemos! El capitán es un hombre de tez morena clara, cabello con canas y corpulento; el sujeto a quien apuntan es un joven de alrededor de 18 años alto de piel blanca de cabello negro al igual que sus ojos viste un pantalón de mezclilla y una playera sin mangas negra con muchos agujeritos. El ladrón baja lentamente el arma, sube lentamente sus dos manos hacia arriba en dirección a su nuca, en tanto el capitán sigue son su vista el movimiento de las manos hasta que se percata de un extraño tatuaje que el chico tiene en su brazo izquierdo el cual se le hace familiar y se queda en shock. El criminal percibe la distracción y en un hábil movimiento de su espalda saca dos armas que dispara en contra de los policías como segundo acto impulsa su cuerpo hacia atrás pegando un salto que lo deja detrás del mostrador de metal, comienza a disparar hacia unas cadenas que sujetan una campana de metal que esta en el techo cuando la campana se desprende de las cadenas cae encima de los uniformados a excepción del capitán. El maleante corre hacia las escaleras eléctricas que dan al piso de arriba y sube velozmente. El capitán reacciona y sigue al ladrón él cual esta en el área de alimentos, lo ve que corre rápido entre los estantes mientras él llega a ese piso comienza a disparar en contra del criminal pero sin dar en su objetivo. El maleante llega al área de vinos toma unas botellas destapando una y tomando un poco después se dirige al final del estante y antes de que el capitán entre en este pasillo tira los anaqueles deteniendo en seco a su persecutor que solo ve como los vinos, licores y de más bebidas se rompen desencadenando un efecto domino que tira las demás repisas, del otro lado el criminal saca de su pantalón una recipiente que abre y mientas corre hacia el siguiente piso va tirando su contenido. El capitán regresa por donde vino encontrando las escaleras que el chico uso para subir desde ahí lo ve alejarse de unos tanques de metano empieza a disparar pero sin dar en su objetivo ya que el ladrón es ágil y muy rápido. Finalmente el criminal se encuentra con las escaleras se detiene rápidamente abre las otras dos botellas que trae y las derrama en la ropa que encuentra cerca de él después de su pantalón saca una tira de cerillos que parte a la mitad, agachándose esquiva un disparo del capitán que casi lo alcanza, se levanta, mira al capitán encendiendo las dos tiras de cerillos. - ¡Detente!… que demonios vas hacer… el capitán que ha visto todo lo que el ladrón ha hecho. El criminal mira contento y triunfante al capitán, deja caer los cerillos en el camino de pólvora que hizo y lanza los otros a la ropa bañada en alcohol enseguida el fuego se extiende por todo el lugar, el uniformado en tanto mira como el fuego se expande hacia donde él se encuentra como puede se avienta hacia el piso de abajo. En un casino en las afueras de la ciudad una sensual mujer baila al ritmo de una música exótica los hombres ahí presentes la miran extasiados especialmente por la belleza de esa despampanante mujer de cabello negro de tez bronceada, cuerpo seductor, en uno de sus brazos un extraño tatuaje del color de su piel y un vestido negro que detallaba cada curva de su impresionante cuerpo. Todos los presentes miraban sin dar crédito a lo que ven sus ojos un espectáculo sin igual en tanto en las salas de juego los jugadores pierden grandes cantidades de dinero apostando. Adentro en la habitación donde se encuentra la sensual mujer bailando cinco hombres la ven mientras que cuentan los millones de dólares que han ganado hasta que la mujer de su vestido saca dos armas con las cuales mata a cada uno de los sujetos ahí presentes. En el centro de la ciudad No. 10 a unas cuantas cuadras de la tienda \"Campana Dorada\" el trafico se ha apoderado de la poca paciencia que tienen los conductores en especial de una joven de cabello corto negro, piel morena y hermosos ojos azules, es tanta ya su desesperación que no deja de gritar groserías y de apretar el claxon, con ella se encuentra otra joven de su misma edad 18 años de tez blanca, pelirroja con rizos y ojos verdegris, ella es quien trata de tranquilizarla. - Ya cálmate… tranquila en cualquier momento el trafico se va a mover… tranquila - ¡¿Como que tranquila?!... sabes cuánto tiempo hemos estado aquí… ¡Idiotas muévanse! La joven respiro tratando de no perder también la paciencia. - Mírame La joven de ojos verdegrises llamo la atención de su joven compañera quien la mira y se calma, en tanto el tráfico avanza y el semáforo esta apunto de cambiar a verde, en el carro las dos jóvenes se miran, lentamente se acercan hasta rosar sus labios en un cálido beso, el semáforo esta en verde y el automóvil de ellas no avanza ya que están entretenidas en sus asuntos, los conductores empiezan a tocar el claxon de sus autos pero ellas siguen en lo suyo hasta que un oficial de transito llega a la ventana al lado del copiloto, él trata de llamar su atención tocando la ventana pero nada una vez más lo intenta y una de las jóvenes le hace una seña indicándole que se valla, el uniformado enojado toca de nuevo. - Señoritas por favor muévanse…¡Ahora! En la tienda departamental el ladrón sube al barandal de la escalera bajando rápidamente antes de llegar al siguiente piso se su pantalón saca un arpón pequeño que lanza hacia el techo columpiándose en la cuerda del ancla directo hacia la salida mientras se columpia la soga baja poco a poco a la altura de una puerta que esta abierta pero enseguida se cierra cuando un padrecito entra al lugar, el criminal se dirige a toda velocidad hacia la puerta cerrada. En tanto el fuego se expande en el piso de arriba acercándose a los tanques de metano por un lado y por el otro a el área de licores, el maleante se tapa la cara para después inevitablemente estrellarse en la puerta de vidrio, gracias a la fuerza que lleva traspasa el cristal, al instante se suelta y milagrosamente entra en su carro que está abierto. El capitán cae en un globo inflable gigante al instante se levanta corre a la salida viendo al padre. - ¡Nooo!... que hace aquí… hay que irnos ¡ahora! El capitán jala al clérigo quien mira al piso de arriba mirando el fuego, ya afuera el ladrón ya no está, el uniformado detiene un taxi baja al conductor y sigue al maleante. En tanto el oficial de transito espera que las chicas avancen, la conductora se separa de su fiel compañera mira con enojo al oficial y le grita - ¡¿Qué te pasa idiota?! No ve que estoy ocupada porque no se va a molestar a alguien más La joven logra intimidar al oficial que empieza a discutir con la joven conductora, mientras que la otra joven solo se limita a verlos con fastidio, ve hacia la ventana que se encuentra a su lado por el retrovisor nota que un carro se acerca a toda velocidad hacia donde esta el oficial pero es emaciado tarde para hacerlo a un lado cuando el automóvil del ladrón llega a donde el uniformado se encuentra la defensa del vehículo se lleva al oficial el cual flotaba en una patineta voladora en el aire, en ese mismo instante el tiempo parece detenerse y el criminal voltea a su izquierda mirando a la joven de aquel auto perdiéndose en sus ojos verdegrises por unos segundos se sonríen sin percatarse que el oficial se estrella contra un coche, el tiempo parece regresar a su normalidad, para ellos, y el maleante se vuelve a concentrar en conducir esquivando el tráfico. En ese instante se escucha un gran sonido que hace temblar todo mientras que las ventanas de los edificios cercanos se rompen para después sentirse una tremenda explosión, se trata de la tienda departamental que ha volado en miles de pedazos. Las personas que están cerca se impresionan al ver una enorme nube de humo y fuego que puede verse a la distancia. En el casino la mujer sale de la habitación de donde estuvo bailando cierra la puerta baja las escaleras contoneándose de forma sensual hacia la salida hasta que… - ¡Señorita! Ella voltea asustada la han descubierto ahora tendrá que matarlos a todos, tranquilamente se da la vuelta mirando al hombre que la llamo. - Si diga -. Habla con un tono seductor - No le gustaría jugar en la ruleta de la suerte -. Se trata de un empleado del lugar - Mmmmm… esta bien - Escoja un numero - El 12 La ruleta dio vueltas sin parar hasta que lentamente se detiene, ella mira sorprendida la ruleta al ver que el número que ha caído es el que ella escogió, el hombre la mira felicitándola. - Felicidades señorita ya gano… aquí esta su premio 500 dorales para que gaste en ropa. Ella sonríe complacida marchándose con el botín que robo en la habitación y con el premio de la ruleta… Esa si que es suerte… Nota Final: Gracias por leerlo si deseas comentar me harias muy feliz.

En el centro de la ciudad No. 10 el capitán seguía en un taxi al joven ladrón la persecución parecía interminable y difícil por el tráfico que había, el uniformado esquivaba con mucho trabajo los carros mientras intentaba dispararle al vehículo del criminal desesperado miro a su lado derecho notando a el padrecito. - ¡Ayúdeme!… conduzca por favor El padre mira al capitán asustado para decirle: - No se conducir lo siento - ¡¿Qué?! Como es posible -. El capitán miro su arma y después el padre y le extendió el arma al padre.- Tome - ¡No!... Es un pequeño pastor descarriado - ¿Qué?... no diga tonterías y dispare-. El capitán le aventó el arma. – no es difícil levante el arma y dispare. El padre levanto el arma temblorosamente mientras repetía: - Levantar el arma y disparar…Levantar el arma y disparar Cuando el padre levanto firme el arma disparo… haciendo que la bala se estrellara en el vidrio provocando que volara en miles de pedazos lo que provocó que el capitán perdiera el control del taxi que se dirigió irremediablemente a chocar con un vehículo, el capitán giro bruscamente el volante haciendo que el taxi chocara la parte delantera de un lado con el otro pasando de largo. - ¡Idiota! ¿Qué hace?-. El capitán grita perdiendo casi los estribos - Me dijo que levantara el arma y disparará - ¡No!... bueno si pero era lógico que debía salir por la ventana y después disparar… ¡diablos!... está bien dispare de nuevo - ¡¿Qué?!... no ni loco - ¡Maldición!... ¡DISPARE!-. De inmediato el capitán volvió su atención a seguir manejando El padre levanto el arma temblando de nervios y al no resistir los nervios bajo el arma - ¡Tranquilo!…¡no tiemble!-. Vuelve a gritar el capitán El padre se remanga las mangas de la sotana negra toma el arma, la levanta fija su mirada hacia donde el carro del ladrón de encuentra el cual se mueve de arriba abajo, de derecha a izquierda cuando el padre logra tener en la mira sobre el criminal por un instante dispara…la bala sale a todo velocidad el tiempo parece detenerse mientras la bala se dirige a su destino, en el camino traspasa un folleto sobre un casino para después hacer contacto con el vidrio trasero del carro haciéndole un hoyo redondo al pasar la bala el vidrio se destruye en millones de pedazos, el proyectil sigue su curso rozando el asiento del conductor para después incrustándose en el hombro del conductor de donde empieza a salir mucha sangre lo cual le provoca un dolor imparable que le hace perder el control del automóvil estrellándose en un edificio. El capitán mira sorprendido al padre que lo mira sonriente, él toma el arma notando la marca que tiene el padre en el brazo izquierdo quedando atónito sin hacer nada lo que provoca que el taxi choque contra un carro estacionado. Los Antares han recorrido el universo generación tras generación siguiendo las pistas y los indicios sobre existencia de las piedras, hace 21 años tras regresar junto a su líder Arakami de una expedición de cinco años a los nuevos sistemas solares descubiertos se encontraron con la terrible noticia de que el planeta Tierra había sido salvado con la ayuda de las cuadro piedras y el quinto elemento. Los informes apuntaban a dos personas las cuales habían intervenido en esa asombrosa hazaña, para la mala suerte de Arakami estos héroes habían partido sin rumbo del planeta Tierra, frustrado creyó que su sueño había llegado a su fin y dos años más tarde la noticia de la llegada al planeta de los héroes le devolvió la esperanza. Tras no conseguir nada en el Hospital San John los Antares siguieron buscando hasta encontrar una iglesia en Brooklyn encabezada por el padre Vito Cornelius el cual era guardián de la llave de un templo en Egipto del cual se decía que en el residían las cuatro piedras. Cuando se entrevistaron con el padre lo único que consiguieron fue un catastrófico final para el padre y para la mayoría de los niños que vivían en la iglesia, la misteriosa llave jamás apareció y crimen de los Antares jamás fue castigado. En el balcón de un edificio el ladrón luchaba por poder subir aquel balcón cuando lo logro cayó al suelo, dirigió sus manos a su nuca de donde empezó a desprender una piel la cual jalo con todas sus fuerzas quitándose la máscara que le daba un aspecto muy diferente, se levanta con mucho trabajo, camina por los pasillos recargándose por las paredes hasta llegar a una puerta, miro el apellido que había en la puerta, el cual decía \"FAM Dallas\" se recargo en la puerta y se dejó caer. La escuela militar de Brooklyn se encuentra en las fronteras de la ciudad en ese lugar los niños que son abandonados por sus padres son enviados a ese lugar al igual que los jóvenes que han incumplido la ley. El lugar es bastante grande hay muchas habitaciones, un gran campo de fútbol americano, duelas de básquetbol, una gran área verde de entrenamiento, oficinas, salones y un gran comedor; son las tres de la tarde los niños y jóvenes que ahí viven van a comer ya en el comedor en una de las mesas cuatro niños comen y platican amenamente, el primero de ellos de piel blanca y ojos cafés oscuro es Jayson Dallas, junto a él una niña de hermosa sonrisa, ojos verdegrises y cabello ondulado rojizo es Lucy Dallas, la siguiente es una niña de ojos café oscuros al igual que su cabello ella es Denis Dallas y la otra niña de pelo corto es Nancy Dallas, ellos llegaron a ese lugar después de que la iglesia donde vivían fue atacada y el padre Vito Cornelius cruelmente asesinado, el general Beristaín los llevo ahí después de esos terribles acontecimientos. Un niño más que llego con ellos es Jack Dallas este niño de no más de 12 años camina por los pasillos del comedor con una bandeja de comida en sus manos de repente uno de los jóvenes del lugar le puso el pie derribándolo y haciendo volar la bandeja de comida por los aires que en su trayectoria se estrelló en contra del General Beristaín quien enfurecido miro su traje sucio y grito: - ¡De quien es esto! Todos los niños y jóvenes se miraban asustados. - ¡¿Quién fue el idiota?! –. Volvió a gritar el general Asustados todos miraron hacia el suelo al ver esto el general dirigió su vista hacia abajo viendo a Jack en el suelo completamente asustado, el general lo vio con cólera. - ¡Levántate! -. Le ordeno colérico mientras se dibujaba en su rostro una sonrisa macabra Al instante el niño se levantó mirando hacia el suelo, el general cerro sus puños con mucha fuerza, acción que fue percatada por el niño que levanto su vista asustado notando los enormes ojos del general llenos de cólera enseguida el hombre levanto uno de sus puños dejándolo caer bruscamente en el rostro del niño que cayó al suelo. Beristaín enfurecido le ordeno que se levantara, el pequeño se levantó, el general repitió el castigo y su víctima volvió a caer al suelo. Todos miraban sin dar crédito a lo que veían el infante yacía en el suelo lleno de sangre en todo su rostro parecía que estaba muerto, el militar volvió a ordenar que se levantara pero Jack no podía los gritos del general le parecían tan lejanos con trabajos los podía distinguir, haciendo acopio de todas sus fuerzas puso sus manos en el suelo levando un poco su cuerpo levanto su vista viendo al general borrosamente hasta que sus brazos se rindieron y volvió a caer al suelo - ¡Insolente!... ¡levántate!...-. Fuera de si el general se acercó al niño con intenciones de patearlo… - ¡Basta Beristaín!... -. Grito el comándate Joseph El general se detuvo volteando a ver al comándate - Este niño insolente estaba jugando con la comida y se le hizo muy gracioso aventarla… ¡Merece un castigo! - Los golpes no son la solución… estás loco quieres matarlo - ¡No te metas!... es mi asunto yo sabré que castigo es mejor para él - Si piensas seguirlo castigando de esa manera tendré que intervenir… dale otro castigo menos doloroso El general miro con enojo al comándate, se dirigió dónde estaba el niño, tomo aire profundamente, ya más tranquilo levanto a Jack dejándolo de rodillas para después tomar los platos de comida que estaban cerca de él y los tiro al suelo - Quiero que te comas toda la comida que está en el suelo…y no te vas a ir hasta que termines -. El general tomo más platos llenos de comida tirándola cerca del niño que aterrorizado comenzó a comerse la comida del suelo. Por fin la noche había llegado todos fueron a sus respectivas habitaciones para dormir. En la habitación de Jack él se encontraba dolido por los golpes pero enfurecido por la vergüenza que había pasado, sus compañeros de habitación habían sido mandados a correr y él estaba solo, de la nada la puerta se abrió bruscamente dejando entrar al general Beristaín que reía maliciosamente, cerró la puerta viendo con una indescriptible mirada al chico y camino hacia donde él estaba, el infante comenzó a retroceder hasta toparse con la pared; los ojos del pequeño estaban llenos de miedo y horror en tanto el general se acercaba a él mientras se desabrochaba el cinturón y los pantalones, Jack no podía hacer nada más que mirar con horror lo que iba a suceder de su boca salió un grito lleno de terror… - ¡Noooo…! Jack se levantó completamente asustado sudando, miro a su alrededor viendo que estaba en una habitación desconocida, miro hacia la puerta y tomo aire. - Uffffff… solo era un sueño Enseguida la puerta se abrió bruscamente de ella apareció una joven que al verlo se lanzó a abrazarlo al instante a Jack lo invadió un tremendo dolor. - Auch… - Lo siento Jack olvidaba que estabas herido -. Dijo la joven separándose de él y mirándolo a los ojos.- Te extrañe mucho… en donde estabas a donde fueron después de que escapamos de la escuela militar - Por un tiempo Denis y yo anduvimos vagando por el mundo después accidentalmente nos llevaron al planeta Imega donde vivimos durante algunos años hasta que logramos escapar de ese planeta - Ya veo quien pensaría que la pareja más rica y respetada de este sistema se dedicara a robar tiendas departamentales -. Dijo Lucy levantando la máscara del suelo que Jack traía en las manos - Fue la única forma que encontramos para regresar al planeta Tierra Los dos jóvenes se quedaron callados mirándose hasta que por la puerta entro otra joven de cabello corto y ojos azules de nombre Nancy. - Jack por fin despertaste…-. Se acercó a saludar a su viejo amigo para después caminar junto a Lucy.- Ya vites las noticias…prender televisor En la pared de enfrente apareció una pantalla que se activó al escuchar la orden de Nancy para después encenderse. - Increíble….- continúo hablando Nancy. - en toda la ciudad te buscan mmm…-. Pensó al mirar a Jack.- Bueno no a ti… precisamente porque nadie sabe que eres tú el ladrón por esta mascara…-. Dijo tomando la máscara que tenía Lucy en sus manos.-… Me sorprendes eres inteligente. - Así que Lucy y tú viven juntas -. Dijo tranquilamente Jack - Si… muuuy juntas -. Esto último Nancy lo dijo con más ahincó y abrazo a Lucy por la cintura El joven miro a la pareja dibujándose en su cara una sonrisa para levantar el dedo y señalarlas pero antes de poder decir algo en la televisión apareció el capitán que lo seguía, él platicaba con la prensa. - Es el criminal más buscado en el sistema está herido y debe de estar cerca de aquí.- Fue lo que declaro el capitán para después retirarse - Como ven la policía sigue buscando al criminal que hizo explotar la tienda departamental \"Campana Dorada\"-. La periodista caminaba por los pasillos de un edificio cercano donde encontraron al capitán y al padre después de haberse estrellado hasta que llego junto al padre.- Disculpe padre es cierto que usted hirió al despiadado criminal El padre estaba siendo atendido por los paramédicos y al escuchar la pregunta se persigno para decir: - Creo… creo… que si - ¡ ¿Qué?!... como un padre fue capaz de lastimarme -. Gritó enfurecido Jack mientras miraba la televisión - Jajajajajajajajaja… -. Se escuchó la risa de Nancy.- Así que el tierno corderito por fin saco sus colmillos Jack miro con desconcierto a Nancy que no paraba de reír - Se te hace gracioso... ¡casi me mata! -. Replicó el joven - No es eso lo que le da risa, lo que ocurre es que ese no es un padrecito cualquiera…-. Lucy tomo aire para después continuar.- Se trata de Jayson - ¡¿Jayson?! - Si… jajajajaaja… casi… casi… mata a su propio hermano -. Contestó Nancy que no podía controlar su risa - Ese no es mi hermano -. Recrimino Jack cruzando los brazos y mirando hacia su izquierda Nancy se calmó poco a poco y agrego - Lo sé pero lleva tú mismo apellido y nos educaron como hermanos cuando éramos niños Jack quedo en silencio regresando su mirada para seguir viendo la entrevista que le hacían a Jayson. En el centro de la ciudad No. 10 existe uno de los más lujosos edificios del planeta el cual acaba de ser comprado por la pareja Dallas en su interior en la sala suena el teléfono. - Contestar teléfono Se oye una voz de mujer que va entrando a la sala de la enorme mansión, el teléfono deja de sonar dejando escuchar la voz de un hombre. - Hola Denis… soy Jack… me encontré con Lucy y Nancy a…sí también con el idiota de Jayson… sabias que es padre y el muy idiota se atrevió a dispararme… bueno como sea… estoy bien espero que te haya ido bien en el casino sobre la fiesta de en la noche prepara todo yo voy a llegar con ellas más tarde… te amo cuídate -. La voz termina de decir y cuelga Denis camina de un lado a otro por la sala pensando en algo, se para en seco se sienta en el piso junto a dos bolsas color negras abriendo una bolsa de la cual saca una paca de dinero la cual acerca a su nariz para olerlo y después sonríe complacida. La noche había llegado a la ciudad No. 10 en la Mansión Dallas llegan autos muy lujosos y muy caros de los cuales bajan las personas más ricas e importantes del planeta todas venían a festejar la llegada de la pareja más rica de toda la constelación. Adentro Denis recibía a sus invitados con una sonrisa estaba feliz mientras miraba a los invitados y pensaba Impresionante en este planeta hay mucho trabajo mmm aquel hombre se ve que es el más rico-. Denis miro a un hombre de edad avanzada que iba con una jovencita de casi 40 años menos que él, ella le sonrió sensualmente.-Ese hombre es pan comido apuesto que con que le hable bonito me heredara todos sus millones En la estación de policía el capitán estaba en su despacho investigando tratando de averiguar quién podía ser el ladrón empezó a buscar en la red de criminales más buscados de toda la constelación pero ninguno de ellos se le parecía, cansado decidió descansar, recargo su cabeza en el respaldo de la silla estuvo así pensando por unos minutos. El teléfono empezó a sonar pero capitán seguía sumido en sus pensamientos. - Ya ya ya… ya voy… -. Enojado el capitán salió de su trance levantando la bocina del teléfono - Hijo querido mío ya viste quien llego a nuestra ciudad -. De la bocina salió una voz chillona se trataba de la mamá del capitán - Él miro hacia enfrente se pasó su mano libre por el rostro fastidiado de la actitud de su madre. - No mamá ¿quién está en la ciudad? - Jack y Denis Dallas la pareja más rica de todo el sistema. - Mmmmmmm… - Adivina que… en este preciso momento hicieron una fiesta para conocer a las personas más ricas e importantes del planeta - Y… - ¡Hijo!... no crees que es necesario ir a dales la bienvenida a estos jovencitos - Mmmmm… estoy ocupado - ¡¿Qué?!... es más importante tu trabajo que yo - No mamá - Lo que faltaba… después de largas horas de sufrimiento cuando naciste me pagas de esta manera… mejor hubiera comprado un robot - No mamá… mmmmm… está bien vamos paso por ti en una hora… te parece - ¡Si! Perfecto estaré lista Termino de decir aquella mujer, el capitán colgó el teléfono agacho su cabeza por unos instantes estuvo así hasta que levanto su cabeza rápidamente y dijo para sí mismo. - ¿Jack y Denis Dallas?... como unos jóvenes de su edad tienen tanto dinero. El capitán ingreso los nombres dentro de la computadora y enseguida la historia sobre ellos apareció: Eran dos jóvenes que no se sabía de dónde venían, fueron adoptados por un magnate en el planeta Imega, él murió cuando ellos tenían 14 años, los jóvenes perdieron todo en menos de un año pero para el año siguiente sus riquezas y propiedades volvieron a surgir de manera misteriosa, dejaron el planeta y desde entonces viajan por todo el sistema haciendo pequeños negocios aumentando así sus riquezas de forma extraña. El capitán vio una foto de Jack y a su mente vino la imagen del ladrón mirándolo en la tienda departamental sus ojos eran los mismos de aquel rico joven, sabía que él era el criminal pero su cara era diferente, algo en él le decía que él era aquel hombre que rodo la tienda departamental, miro por un rato la foto, enseguida tomo su chamarra, salió del despacho y se fue de la estación de policía.

El capitán conducía fastidiado de la plática tan vacía de su madre pero por fin había llegado a la mansión Dallas entraron directamente al estacionamiento para ser recibidos por un robot que se acercó a la puerta de la madre para ayudarle a bajar, cuando el capitán se bajó del auto le dio las llaves al robot para después tomar del brazo a su madre y entrar a la enorme mansión; subieron en el elevador mientras la madre no dejaba de hablar cuando llegaron a un piso la puerta se abrió y el mayordomo les dio la bienvenida, con la mirada la madre del capitán busco a la joven pareja pero solo vio a Denis y enseguida jalo a su hijo para saludar a la joven que platicaba con algunas mujeres mayores que ella. - Buenas noches… la madre del capitán a Denis con beso y todo como si fueran amigas de toda la vida Enseguida Denis reconoció aquella mujer pero sabía que no podía decirle quien era porque enseguida todos sabrían quién era en realidad, así que saludo muy respetuosamente a la madre del capitán para después mirarlo completamente sorprendida. - Buenas noches señorita -. El capitán le extendió la mano a Denis quien no daba crédito a lo que veía.- Mi nombre es Korben Dallas es un placer conocerla. Denis vio aquel hombre sorprendida, ese hombre era el que los adopto cuando eran bebés por eso tienen su apellido. Cuando era niña lo vio en varias ocasiones le contaba sus travesuras y sus sueños pero él nunca le hablo o siquiera la escucho. Su madre de Korben había sido la que accedió a ponerle a los cinco bebés su apellido al no saber cuál era su nieto y por otro lado él no sabía quién era Denis porque después de haberse disparado estuvo en coma durante un año al siguiente despertó pero no hablaba, ni escuchaba, ni veía estaba en estado vegetativo pero aun así su madre lo llevaba a ver a sus cinco hijos, desafortunadamente un día la iglesia del padre Vito Cornelius fue destruida y la madre de Korben pensó que sus nietos habían muerto, años más tarde el hombre reacciono pero no sabía nada sobre su vida poco a poco recordaba cosas pero nunca pudo rememorar que había salvado al mundo que conoció a Leeloo y que tenía un hijo. - Disculpe señorita y su esposo ¿Dónde se encuentras? -. Pregunto Korben - Jack… él no tarda en llegar fue por unas amigas - Aaaah…-. Por alguna extraña razón Korben presentía que era una mentira - Denis sabias que mi hijo es el capitán de policía de la ciudad No. 10 -. La madre de Korben intervino en la conversación - Enserio que bien… un interesante trabajo... señor Dallas. Si aunque se escapen los criminales siempre los atrapo -. Korben dijo orgulloso estrechando con fuerza su puño derecho con su mano izquierda asustando a la madre y a Denis. En ese instante Jack entró a la sala acompañado de Lucy y Nancy que vestían hermosos vestidos del mismo color y él un esmoquin negro. - Y en ocasiones terminan viniendo a mí -. Termino de decir Korben mientras miraba inquisitivamente a él joven que acaba de entrar. Jack camino hacia sus invitados saludándolos amablemente mientras que sus acompañantes iban por un poco de bebida y botana. - Buenas noches señora… es un placer tenerla aquí en esta mansión -. Jack tomo la mano de la madre de Korben rozando sus labios en el torso de la mano de la mujer para después mirarla a los ojos. La mujer se emocionó mucho con este acto tanto que antes que el joven la soltara la madre lo jalo hacia ella abrazándolo y diciéndole al oído. - Que guapo…como me encantaría tener 40 años menos. - ¡MAMÁ! -. Replicó al instante Korben Jack todo nervioso se separó de la madre notando al acompañante de esa mujer reconociéndolo como el único hombre al que alguna vez llamo padre y que hoy estuvo a punto de atraparlo además no podía creer que se encontraba de nuevo frente a él tal vez era coincidencia o el destino. - Buenas noches señor… bienvenido Korben sintió el desconcierto del joven y enseguida pensó que no estaba equivocado que el ladrón de la tienda departamental era ese joven sin importar que sus rostros fueron diferentes - Buenas noches… yo debo darle la bienvenida a la ciudad… aunque me pregunto… con usted aquí… la ciudad ¿estará segura? - ¿A qué se refiere señor? -. Denis preguntó confundida - Me sorprende que unos niños no mayores a 18 años tengan impresionante riqueza sin ni siquiera tener una sola empresa y a dónde van los crímenes más impresionantes ocurren - Tal vez coincidencia -. Se defendió Jack - Me perdonara -. Denis agrego sin perder la tranquilidad.- Pero se equivoca tenemos empresas en cada planeta que hemos visitado - Si como no…les creo -. Korben termino de decir se acercó a Jack dándole unas palmadas en la espalda. Este acto provoco en Jack un terrible dolor pero él se aguantó. - ¿Qué diablos insinúa?... además no entiendo quien lo invitó a esta fiesta -. El enojo intento disfrazar el terrible dolor que tenía Jack en su herida. - Así que no te gustan los policías… que escondes… niño… ó a la carga Korben - ¡Basta Korben!... no te traje aquí para que hagas esto… se supone que vinimos a dales la bienvenida… no a levantar falsos en contra de ellos -. la madre de Korben lo jalo hacia atrás separándolo de Jack. - Anda ve con tu mami a que te consuele -. Con una voz burlona se expresó Jack Korben volteo enfurecido con intenciones de ir a golpear al joven pero su madre la jalo en tanto Jack se dio la media vuelta tomando la mano de Denis y caminaron hacia donde se encontraban Nancy y Lucy. - Hola chicas que tal se la están pasando -. Saludo Denis a sus amigas de cuando eran niñas. - Bien… tienen una casa increíble su sala es del triple de nuestro departamento-. Lucy miraba a su alrededor viendo aquel enorme lugar - Que se siente estar casados apuesto que ya no aguantas vivir con ella -. Dijo divertida Nancy - No te equivocas no estamos casados y además me gusta vivir con ella -. Respondió Jack.- Me permiten un momento -. Él camino hacia el elevador ante el desconcierto de sus amigas, entro en el subiendo al último piso donde se encontraba su recamara. Adentro Jack se quitó el saco para después sacarse la camisa; de repente la puerta se abrió dejando entrar a Denis que vio la camisa llena de sangre camino asustada y limpio la sangre que escurría por la espalda del joven para después sentarse frente a él lo miro y besarlo muy apasionadamente él correspondió el beso después de minutos se separaron se miraron y él de su pantalón saco un pequeño celular. - Marcar Anthony Enseguida una voz contesto - Anthony adivina que… un policía sospecha de mí ya sabes que hacer… te lo encargo…-. Jack colgó para lanzarse a los brazos de Denis que lo recibe cálidamente cuidando de no lastimarlo más. En la madrugada cuando la fiesta ha terminado en un edificio corre un hombre es el ladrón de la tienda departamental detrás de él cientos de policías intentan atraparlo pero él es muy hábil y los uniformados no pueden atraparlo después de una larga persecución en los pasillos del edificio inesperadamente el criminal salta por una ventana en el aire lanza un gancho que se inserta milagrosamente en el edificio de enfrente, tuvo suerte que a esa hora no hubiera carros a esa altura, sin problemas llega al otro edificio y la policía despliega todas las unidades al siguiente edificio mientras tanto el maleante baja rápido por el ascensor hasta el estacionamiento rompe el vidrio de un automóvil entra en el pero la alarma se activa haciendo que el auto explote en miles de pedazos cuando la policía entra encuentra al hombre completamente calcinado e irreconocible pero los uniformados tiene suficiente evidencia para notificar que el criminal de la tienda departamental ha muerto trágicamente. Ayer por la tarde fue encontrado el cuerpo del dueño del casino de la ciudad No. 10 al igual que otros tres hombre además de fueron robados 20 millones de dólares del casino aún no se sabe quién fue el responsable pero la policía sigue investigando. Sobre el ladrón de la Tienda Departamental \"Campana Dorada\" hoy en la madrugada fue encontrado después de una persecución intentó robar un automóvil el cual exploto con él adentro es cruel el destino que este hombre sufrió pero bien dicen que uno mismo es artífice de su propia destrucción… en el lugar de los hechos se encuentra el reportero… - No puede ser… Lucy miraba horrorizada las imágenes que el noticiero de las 6 estaba dando a conocer sabia a la perfección que Jack era el ladrón aunque su aspecto fuera diferente al de él; rápidamente se levantó sin hacer mucho ruido para no despertar a Nancy se vistió, tomo su auto y manejo a toda velocidad hacia la Mansión Dallas sabía que tenía que averiguar que estaba pasando y regresar a tiempo para poder ir a la universidad. Cuando llego a la mansión toco desesperadamente a la puerta espero unos segundos volvió a tocar pero nadie abrió así que se desesperó y empezó a tocar incesantemente hasta que la puerta se abrió, se trataba de un robot pequeño. - Familia Dallas ¿Qué es lo que desea? - Vengo a buscar a Jack -. Lucy miro con mucha inquietud aquel pequeño robot que le había abierto la puerta. - No es posible ellos duermen regrese a las 11 am -. Termino de decir el robot para cerrar la puerta. Lucy estaba desesperada quería tirar la puerta a como diera lugar pero se tranquilizó tomando aire profundamente, toco una vez más la puerta y una vez más el robot abrió. - Familia Dallas ¿Qué es lo que desea? Lucy se quedó pensando un momento miro al robot y sonrió. - Soy de la limpieza viene a hacer el aseo - Espere un momento -. Enseguida el robot escaneo su rostro para después empezar a buscar su identificación en su base de datos pero inesperadamente el robot salió volando por los aires estrellándose en la pared más cercana. Lucy entro a toda velocidad pero el robot no iba a dejar que un intruso entrara a la mansión así que activo todas las alarmas y cinco robots armados aparecieron apuntándole a la joven que no consiguió abrir el elevador. - Intruso, intruso, intruso -. Decían en unísono los robots haciendo tremendo escandalo Lucy miro impresionada la rapidez con que aparecieron los robots y su actitud defensiva sin más que poder hacer levanto las manos. - ¿Qué hacen? Se abrió la puerta del elevador del cual salió Denis y uno de los robots se acercó a explicarle. - Alarma intruso… alarma intruso - No es ningún intruso es mi hermana déjenla ella tiene derecho de venir a esta casa a la hora que sea entendido -. Denis le ordeno a los robots - Entendido - Entendido a decir los robots retirándose del lugar Denis le indico a Lucy que la siguiera así que ella entro con su hermana al elevador y en unos segundos estaban en la cocina. - ¿Qué te sirvo un té o un café? -. Dijo Denis haciéndole seña de que tomara asiento arrimándole una silla junto a la mesa Lucy observo la conducta de su hermana era tranquila y al instante supo que el que estaba muerto no era su hermano Jack que tal vez era una treta. - Té por favor… si no es molestia -. Por fin dijo Lucy Denis se acercó a la mesa con dos tazas le extendió una a su hermana y se quedó con la otra. - Dime que te trae tan temprano aquí Lucy dio un sorbo a su té bajo la taza, cerró los ojos un momento para después abrirlos pero antes de decir algo un sonido la interrumpió. - Tiene un correo -. Se escuchó decir a la voz mecánica Lucy miro hacia donde vino el sonido de la máquina y sin quitar los ojos de ese lugar dijo: - Vine porque creo que es bueno que nos reunamos de nuevo que te parece -. Al instante regreso su mirada a Denis esperando una respuesta. - Mmm… es muy buena idea aunque no creo que Jack este muy de acuerdo si Jayson está presente - Por eso… tú no le vas a decir nada…-. Lucy hizo una pausa para tomar otro poco al té y continúo.- escucha le dirás que quieres irnos a visitar a la universidad, cuando llegues mándame un mensaje y nosotras iremos por ustedes… que te parece - ¿A qué hora? - A las 12 supongo que es buen tiempo considerando la hora a la que usualmente se levantan - Mmmm… ¿Qué tienes pensado?... porque volvernos a reunir -. Pregunto Denis buscando una razón más clara que le hiciera salir con Jack en el estado en que él se encontraba - Hace mucho que no nos vemos… y hay muchas cosas que contar y más aún que encontramos a Korben Dallas… no es motivo para celebrarlo juntos - Si tienes razón…-. Dijo pensativa Denis.- … cuenta con nosotros - Bien en ese caso la Universidad es la de Brooklyn Lucy se levantó felizmente dando un gran trago al té dejo la taza en la mesa, entro al levador dio la vuelta y con la mano le dijo adiós a su hermana. En la iglesia de Brooklyn, Jayson se encontraba viendo un periódico en una hoja de plástico que cambiaba de noticias conforme le ordenaban, el padre cambio de noticia en notica hasta que una llamo su atención se trataba de un artículo donde mencionaban que habían intentado saquear las ruinas del quito elemento en Egipto las mismas ruinas donde hacía 21 años Korben y Leeloo salvaron el mundo, aunque no se llevaron nada intentaron hacerla volar sin conseguir nada los saqueadores no lograron entrar a la cámara donde se encontraban los cuatro elementos; el padre enseguida comenzó a pensar sobre la noticia imaginando que el momento del que el padre Vito Cornelius les advirtió ya había llegado pero después se quedó con la idea que solo fue una coincidencia así que se preparó para dar misa.

En un barrio en la ciudad de Nueva York unos hombres vestidos de negro bajaron de un automóvil ingresaron a uno de los edificios se trataba de los Antares que tenía una pista sobre el paradero de la piedras, subieron a un elevador subiendo al último piso de este edificio al llegar encontraron una sola puerta en la cual tocaron después de un rato un hombre de tez negra, pelo blanco con un ridículo peinado y muy delgado abrió la puerta - Si -. Dijo aquel hombre con una voz chillona - El señor ¿Rhod? -. Pregunto el más delgado de ellos - ¿Son de hacienda? - No señor -. Contestó el más bajo de los hombres - ¿Vendedores? - No señor -. Respondió el más alto de ellos - Mmmmm… entonces -. El hombre se pudo la mano en la barbilla y antes de que le pudiera decir algo el dijo.- Ya se son parte de mi club de fans verdad… les diré amigos… pasen, pasen están en su casa…quieren mi autógrafo verdad Los cuatro hombres entraron y el más robusto de los cuatro dijo: - No señor - Pues no tengo más que ofrecerles -. El hombre se dispuso a sacarlos de su casa.- bissssbisss-. Les dijo para después arrempujarlos hacia la salida ya que estaban afuera quiso cerrar la puerta peo uno de ellos la detuvo - Vinimos a hacerle una entrevista -. Dijo el delgado - ¿Una entrevista?-. Enseguida se iluminaron los ojos del hombre de tez negra que subió a toda velocidad las escaleras Los hombres vieron a su alrededor las fotografías que había en ese lugar donde el dueño de la casa aparecía con muchas celebridades pero de todas les llamo la atención una en particular en ella se encontraba el dueño, un hombre que reconocieron como Korben Dallas y una mujer que al verla los cuatro dijeron: - El quinto elemento Los cuatro hombres se quedaron callados mirando la foto hasta que… las luces se apagaron, una música rara comenzó mientras que una voz muy varonil decía: - Señores y señoras… con ustedes…RRRRUUUBBBYYY Rhod En eso el hombre de tez negra entro patinando traía un traje con manchas de leopardo con un peinado mucho más ridículo que el anterior y un bastón mientras bailaba ridículamente el ritmo de la música después de dar una vuelta camino como si estuviera embarazado a donde estaban los cuatro hombres que no podían creer lo que sus ojos veían. Ruby encendió el bastón de donde salió una luz roja acercándolo a su boca - Gracias por venir amigos… sabía que el mundo no me había olvidado… y bien comiencen con la electrizante entrevista -. Él acerco el bastón al hombre más alto que se había sentado en un sillón. - Vinimos a hacerle una entrevista -. Dijo seriamente - Ya lo sé… empiecen -. Ruby cambio el bastón al hombre delgado - Al hombre que ayudo a salvar el mundo Ruby se quedó callado miro aquellos hombres y callo en la cuenta que no venían a buscarlo a él si no a las piedras que simbolizaban los cuatro elementos, bajo el bastón apagándolo. - No sé de qué hablan - ¿Dónde están las piedras? -. Pregunto serenamente el hombre robusto - No sé de qué hablan…en verdad amigos no se - Usted y el quinto elemento eran muy buenos amigos no es así -. Ahora habla el hombre de baja estatura Ruby empezó a retroceder y comenzó a caminar hacia las escaleras - Que tonta era… suicidarse para esconder la localización de las piedras -. Se burló el delgado Comentario que hizo que Ruby se detuviera y volteara a verlos. - Pero sabemos que tú las tienes -. Aseguro el alto caminando con no muy buenas intenciones hacia Ruby - No sé de qué hablan - Nadie te recuerda ni siquiera porque condujiste un tonto programa de radio -. El robusto se levantó y también se dirigió a donde estaba el hombre de tez negra - Quieres que te recuerden porque te encontraron descuartizado en una bolsa negra en el basurero de la iglesia de Brooklyn o… -. El hombre de baja estatura saco una navaja - … o danos las piedras y te recordaran por ser el hombre más rico del universo-. Le ofreció el hombre robusto - No sé de qué hablan… en verdad amigos… pero tengo cuatro piedras que les van a gustar… enseguida regreso no se muevan -. Dijo finalmente Ruby para subir las escaleras seguido del hombre alto Cuando llego Ruby a su habitación de detrás de su armario saco una caja acercándose a donde estaba el hombre que lo había seguido abrió la caja dejándolo ver las cuatro piedras que en esa caja había al instante el hombre alto sonrió contento cerro la caja para después tomarla entre sus brazos y salió del cuarto para bajar las escaleras, encontrarse con sus compañeros que al verlo contento supieron que en la caja estaban las cuatro piedras. Ruby corrió a abrirles la puerta despidiéndose cortésmente de los Antares, cuando ellos salieron él Rhod se quedó parado mirando cómo se cerraba la puerta del elevador con los Antares adentro, rápidamente cerro su puerta se dio la vuelta y grito completamente fuera de sí para después subir a toda velocidad a su cuarto. Las doce de la tarde por fin había llegado, Jayson terminaba de dar la misa de las 11 am el padre se despidió de las personas que se acercaban a donde él estaba; en la tercera fila de bancas pudo ver a dos caras que se le hicieron familiares así que espero parado frente al altar esperando que todos se fueran para darse la vuelta, hincarse y comenzar a rezar. - Jayson quien te viera tan serio… ni tú te la crees -. Se acercó Nancy junto a él El padre termino de decir una oración para levantarse pasando a un lado de aquella joven y sentarse en la primera fila - Así he sido siempre y más ahora que soy un siervo del señor… no lo olvides Lucy se levantó de su banca caminando hacia donde estaba el padre sentándose junto a él, lo mira a los ojos tomándole la mano y la coloca entre las suyas. - Padre… confieso que he pecado… porque casi mato a un hombre - Ja… él que lo iba a matar fue él no tu -. Intervino Nancy - Lo sé pero solo intentaba recordarle que ayer él estuvo a punto de matar a su propio hermano Las palabras de Lucy hicieron que el padre volteara a verla sorprendida - ¡¿Qué?! - Si como lo escuchas -. Contestó Nancy - El hombre a quien ayer le disparaste era Jack -. Concluyo Lucy sin despegar su mirada del padre quien se puso todo rojo quitando bruscamente su mano y mirar hacia el altar. En las afueras de la ciudad en uno de los edificios en el departamento no. 666 la puerta es abierta por un hombre albino de alta estatura que ve a los Antares que están ante su puerta uno de ellos él más alto le enseña la caja al hombre albino que al verla los deja pasar para después cerrar la puerta. Aquel departamento estaba oscuro; el hombre alto coloca la caja arriba del único escritorio que hay en ese sitio retrocede un poco quedando en fila con sus compañeros se arrodillan al mismo tiempo dirigiendo su mirada hacia el suelo, en tanto el hombre albino camina junto a la silla que esta atrás del escritorio donde un hombre está sentado mirando hacia las cortinas cerradas. - Señor han traído las piedras los Antares como lo prometieron El hombre que estaba sentado se dio la vuelta quedando frente a las piedras su rostro era ocultado por la oscuridad que había en el departamento, él abrió la caja mirando lo que había adentro, un silencio se hizo hasta que bruscamente el hombre cerro la caja acto que asusto a los cuatro Antares. Arakami se giró de nuevo mirando las cortinas cerradas y solo se escuchó una sombría voz: - Me has fallado Dorian Dorian enfurecido se dio la vuelta mirando las siluetas de los Antares se acercó a un mueble del cual saco un bastón, lo encendió caminado a donde estaban los cuatro tipos al llegar junto al delgado dirigió el bastón para tocarle el cuerpo soltando una descarga eléctrica que lo invadió por completo provocándole un y después cayó al suelo donde aún se retorcía a pesar de que Dorian ya ha retirado el bastón, los dos siguientes corrieron con la misma suerte, el único que quedaba era el alto que al ser tocado por el bastón resistió valientemente el castigo hasta que su cuerpo no pudo más cayendo al suelo pero el albino no dejo de castigarlo lucia feliz y de vez en cuando dejaba salir una pequeña risa. La universidad de Brooklyn es un enorme edificio que comparte un piso con la iglesia que lleva el mismo nombre en el estacionamiento Lucy y Nancy saludan a sus hermanos Jack y Denis para después entrar en un elevador y subir hasta el piso donde está la biblioteca al llegar se abre la puerta de la cual salen los cuatro jóvenes entran en la biblioteca caminan a uno de los pasillos más lejanos de ese lugar ahí Jayson lee un viejo libro hasta que es interrumpido - Mi querido y amado hermano Jayson -. Se burló Jack El padre escucho esa voz familiar volteando hacia atrás viendo a su hermano se levantó a saludarlo y al quedar frente a frente repentinamente Jack le suelta tremendo golpe en la cara lo cual provocó un fuerte dolor en el padre que aguanto el saludo de su \"gentil\" hermano, aquel golpe solo le había provocado una herida en una de las cejas de la cual comenzó a escurrir sangre, el padre tomo aire miro a sus hermanas que detuvieron al agresor antes de que este pudiera volverlo a golpear cerro sus ojos, bajo la mirada disculpándose con su hermano - Los siento Jack no sabía que eras tú… lo siento El aludido se zafa de sus hermanas y camino al lado de Denis, en tanto Jayson levanto su mirada - ¡Pero tú tienes la culpa! - ¿Qué?... -. Miro Jack a su hermano con intenciones de ir a golpearlo de nuevo Jayson brinco un poco al ver la reacción de su hermano pasando saliva - Si…tú... tú… tú tuviste la culpa… es un pecado robarle a tu prójimo - ¿Qué?... el mundo entero nos odia desde el día que nacimos, ¡nos torturaron!… nos quisieron matar… lo que hago no es más que reclamar un poco de todo lo que nos han quitado - No te equivocas nuestro señor sabe porque ocurren esas cosas no debemos cuestionarlo y mucho menos buscar venganza - Ya tranquilos será mejor que nos digas porque estamos aquí -. Trato de aminorar las cosas Nancy preguntándole al padre y camino junto al él para limpiarle la sangre con un pañuelo El padre le arrebato el pañuelo, bajo su mano donde tenía el pañuelo, lo apretó fuertemente y comenzó a decir mirando a sus hermanos. - Hoy por la mañana leí una noticia sobre el saqueo de unas ruinas en Egipto al principio no le tome importancia pero después al saber que de nuevo estamos juntos fue cuando llegue a la conclusión de que el momento había llegado. - ¿El momento? -. Preguntaron al mismo tiempo Jack y Denis - Lo que buscaban en las ruinas eran las cuatro piedras pero no pudieron entrar donde se supone que se encuentran lo que significa es que el mal a regresado -. Lucy siguió explicando.- Por otro lado nosotros cinco volvimos a juntarnos no creen que es raro Jack y Denis miraron a sus hermanos no sabían si era cierto o no pero sabía que si era cierto una enorme responsabilidad y peligro les avecinaba. - ¿Raro? En qué sentido -. Pregunto Denis - En un día todo se sale de control la tienda más segura del planeta destruida -. Argumenta Nancy - Un padre le dispara a un ladrón y una mujer huye con más de 20 millones de dólares sin ser vista -. Agrega Lucy - Pero sobre todo Korben Dallas aparece… no creen que es para pensar -. Termino de explicar Jayson - No en lo más mínimo -. Contesto Jack que se cruzó de brazos - Es imposible el momento aún no llega el padre Cornelius dijo que sería dentro de 5000 años estoque dicen es imposible -. Denis miro a sus hermanos explicándoles lo que pensaba - Ven tengo razón no hay de que alarmarnos el mal regresara en unos 5000 años más, no hay de qué preocuparse -. Jayson termino de decir para regresarle el pañuelo a su dueña y dirigirse a la salida de la biblioteca. En la casa de Korben Dallas un hombre de tez negra tocaba la puerta enseguida la madre del capitán abre la puerta. - Buenas tardes… en que lo puedo ayudar - Señora Dallas se encuentra Korben -. Pregunto el hombre - No quien lo busca - Un viejo amigo… Ruby Rhod La señora el escuchar el nombre se sorprendió mucho pegando un grito que hizo brincar a Ruby enseguida la madre de Korben lo dejo pasar ofreciéndole una bebida para después comenzar a platicar los dos amenamente hasta que la puerta volvió a sonar, la madre fue a abrir. - Hijo adivina quién está aquí… se trata de Ruby Rhod del programa de radio -. Dijo enseguida la madre entes de que su hijo pudiera pasar la puerta - ¿Qué?... ¿Quién?... no lo conozco -. Preguntaba Korben algo molesto mientras entraba y dejaba sus cosas en la mesa para después voltear a ver al hombre delgado de tez negra que estaba sentado en el sillón. Ruby enseguida se paró del sillón para ir a saludar a su viejo amigo - Korben amigo que gusto me da verte - Así… no te conozco ¿Qué quieres? - Korben amigo no te acuerdas de mí y de Kloston Paradise… la Diva Plava Laguna… el quito elemento… el fin del mundo. - Lo siento… pero no me importa… no tengo tiempo de jugar a las adivinanzas -. Termino de decir para subir las escaleras rumbo a su habitación. - Korben amigo ayúdame… espera no me dejes me quieren matar por favor ayúdame… -. Comenzó a llorar Ruby La madre lo miro enojada y le dijo. - Cállese los hombres no lloran Al instante Ruby se quedó callado y se sentó de nuevo en tanto la madre de Korben se sentó junto a él y empezó a explicarle lo que estaba pasando. - Después del accidente en el hospital mi hijo quedo en coma, reacciono tiempo más tarde pero no recordaba nada ni como se llamaba así que poco a poco le fui diciendo quien era. - Y entonces porque no sabe quién soy… pregunto Ruby - Él sufriría mucho al saber que fue lo que paso con Leeloo y su hijo… lo siento pero es mejor que mi hijo no sepa quién es en realidad. - Señora… entonces que voy a hacer esas personas me buscaran y me mataran… y no quiero morir - Escúcheme en la Iglesia Brooklyn encontrara a un padre llamado David, él lo ayudara… ahora por favor vallase. Ruby tomo sus cosas y se fue a buscar al padre David.

Pregunto Nancy mirando a sus hermanos que estaban sentados enfrente de ellas - Nos quedamos solos -. Habló con pocas ganas Jack mirando indiferente hacia a otro lado - Cuando nos adoptaron dormíamos juntos… no tuve otra opción que enamorarme de él y más si era el único con aspecto humano en el planeta Imega -. Denis dijo viendo a Jack que la miraba algo ofendido y enojado.- Aunque debo confesar que es difícil no enamorarse de Jack porque siempre encuentra la forma de hacerme sentir bien sin importar el momento además de que me cumple todo lo que le pido -. Termino de decir para tomar de la mano a su enamorado y besarlo muy apasionadamente. - Y… ustedes -. Pregunto Jack después de separarse de Denis Nancy y Lucy se miraron - Mmmmm… es una historia muyyyyy larga…-. Comenzó a explicar Nancy - Aunque pienso que fue casi de la misma manera que ustedes porque también nos quedamos las dos solas -. Lucy les explicó a sus hermanos tratando de ser lo más breve posible - Además de que en la escuela militar terminamos aborreciendo a los hombres porque solo buscan satisfacer sus deseos carnales -. Agregó Nancy lanzando una mirada retadora a Jack - No todos somos así… -. Intervino Jack tratando de salvar la reputación de su \"especie\".- Hay hombres que sabemos que lo que una mujer necesita es que la escuchen y la comprendan pero sobre todo que se sienta amada, feliz y plena…-. Hizo una pausa y dirigió su mirada a Lucy.-… Para mí la felicidad de una mujer es más importante que cualquier otra cosa. Lucy y Nancy miran sorprendidas a Jack por primera vez lo escuchan decir algo serio. - ¿Qué? -. Pregunto el joven al mirar las expresiones que sus hermanas tenía en su rostro - Increíble… de donde sacaste esa puntada -. Por fin dijo Nancy - No es ninguna puntada eso es lo que he aprendido…-. Una vez más Jack fijo su mirado en Lucy que no dejaba de mirarlo sorprendida. – … o tu qué piensas Lucy - ¿Quién yo?... aaah… bien… -. Lucy no sabía que decir. - … Mmmm… creo que ya es hora de retirarnos nos vemos mañana adiós -. Lucy no resistió la intensa mirada de Jack poniéndose de mil colores para levantarse y salir del restaurante lo más rápido posible junto a Nancy En la Iglesia de Brooklyn Ruby estaba hincado rezando lo poco que sabía hasta que fue interrumpido por Jayson - Disculpe señor… ¿puedo ayudarlo en algo? - Usted es el padre David -. Preguntó esperanzado Ruby al levantándose - No señor… lo siento pero el padre a quien busca ya no se encuentra entre nosotros -. El padre bajo la mirada en señal de respeto - ¡No!... y entonces a que iglesia se mudó… lo necesito encontrar cuanto antes… es de vida o muerte… me van a matar… por favor dígame donde esta -. Comenzó a decir desesperado Ruby - Tranquilícese y dígame para que lo necesita - Me dijeron que él podía ayudarme… además es mi amigo Cuando el padre escucho esto último se sorprendió y recordó por fin el rostro de Ruby Rhod. - Usted es Ruby Rhod… usted ayudo al padre Cornelius a salvar el mundo junto con Korben Dallas… mucho gusto mi nombre es Jayson Dallas - ¿Dallas?... no… no me digas que tú eres el hijo de ese hombre cabeza hueca - Si yo soy Aquellas palabras significaron para Ruby la salvación quedando completamente pasmado mirando sorprendido al padre. En el departamento de Ruby los Antares habían regresado tocaron la puerta varias veces pero nadie abrió así que no tuvieron otra opción más que tirar la puerta ya adentro esculcaron cada rincón de la casa buscando las piedras que simbolizan los cuatro elementos pero no encontraron nada absolutamente nada de lo que estaban buscando enfurecidos los cuatro comenzaron a tirar todo lo que encontraban en la casa finalmente los cuatro quedaron parados frente a la foto donde Korben, Ruby y Leeloo se encontraban el más alto se acercó a la fotografía cerro fuertemente el puño y con furia golpeo la foto rompiendo el vidrio que la protegía de sus nudillos comenzó a salir sangre que escurrió en la foto, separo su puño para abrir la mano mientras decía: - No te vas a escapar te atraparemos… no importa a donde vallas. En la mansión Dallas, Jack y Denis analizaban el mapa del planeta marcando los bancos más importantes y colocando en el mapa los nombres de las personas más ricas del planeta, Denis se quedó mirando fijamente a un punto al azar y comenzó a recordar su vida en el planeta Imega. ***** Flashback****** La nave de comercio de la tierra había llegado al planeta Imega el capitán Terry bajo de la nave a punta de golpes a dos niños que habían entrado de polizontes y que intentaron matarlo antes de poderlos atrapar, a pesar que estaban esposados de pies y manos con mucho trabajo lograba controlarlos, el capitán los llevaba para poderlos vender en el mercado de contrabando de ese planeta, ahí un hombre rico de nombre Bastiaan los compró a un alto precio y enseguida los llevo vivir con él en su enorme casa al principio todo iba bien al parecer a Bastiaan disfrutaba de la compañía de Jack y Denis hasta que un día desafortunadamente él enfermo de gravedad y tiempo después murió heredando todo su dinero a ellos. Jack y Denis al tener menos de 14 años no pudieron administrar correctamente los negocios y empresas así que se vieron en la necesidad de contratar a una persona que les ayudara a administrar su fortuna su nombre era Yanni un maestro de las finanzas que después de unos meses estafo a los dos jóvenes dejándolos sin dinero y en la calle. Durante meses Jack y Denis anduvieron vagando por el planeta durmiendo en las frías calles, en los basureros de las grandes ciudades o donde podían, mendingando algo de comida o dinero y tratando de sobrevivir a cada sujeto o situación que intentaba hacerles daño, parecía que estaban destinados a sufrir toda su vida pero un día artos de esta situación tomaron una difícil decisión buscar al hombre que les había arrebatado todo y que los llevo a vivir en los basureros para poder vengarse de la misma manera. En la Mansión que alguna vez fue de Bastiaan dormía plácidamente Yanni al lado de su esposa, afuera los hombres de seguridad cuidaban celosamente, en la mansión todo parecía estar en orden ya que el silencio reinaba, uno de los guardias caminaba por la parte trasera de mansión con una lámpara al escuchar un ruido se quedó parado buscando con la luminaria la procedencia del ruido en tanto detrás de él una sombra descendía hasta tocar el suelo aquella silueta sigilosamente se levantó sin hacer ningún ruido, en un ágil movimiento tomo del cuello al sujeto de seguridad, le tapó la nariz y boca. Aquel tipo luchaba por zafarse de la sombra pero no consiguió nada la silueta parecía tener una fuerza sobrenatural finalmente el hombre cedió desmallándose por la falta de oxígeno, el intruso lo soltó y el guardia cayó al suelo. El ser extraño tomo la lámpara para apagarla y encenderla varias veces hasta que Denis apareció de entre los arbustos llego hasta donde estaba su hermano miro al hombre de seguridad en el suelo y juntos caminaron hacia la entrada de la mansión. Uno tras uno caían los guardias sin ni siquiera poder ver a su enemigo la venganza había segado a Jack y su hermana parecía que no tenían conciencia, solo maquinas, entraron a la mansión llegando hasta el estacionamiento tomaron varios garrafones de combustible comenzándolos a vaciar en todo el estacionamiento subieron poco a poco con los garrafones hasta que un guardia vio a los dos jóvenes quienes lo miraron sorprendidos y antes de que pudiera pedir ayuda Jack levanto el arma de uno de los hombres que estaba en el suelo y disparo atravesándole la garganta con el disparo corrompiendo el silencio que en la mansión había los dos hermanos se quedaron quietos mirando las entradas y las escaleras de la casa pero nadie apareció. Los dos subieron las escaleras con dos garrafones en cada mano dejando seis más en la sala, entraron a una de las habitaciones viendo a cinco niños que dormían tranquilamente con mucho cuidado bañaron las camas donde estaban los niños así como toda la recamara, salieron entrando a la recamara de junto viendo a Yanni al instante los jóvenes se llenaron de mucho odio y coraje a pesar de ser tan jóvenes albergaban un enorme rencor por aquella persona que sin titubeos los había traicionado, vieron como dormía al lado de su esposa con una enorme sonrisa lo cual denotaba una gran felicidad la cual tal vez esos dos jóvenes jamás podrían sentir. Comenzaron a rociar en la cama el combustible para después salir para bañar los pasillos bajaron las escaleras bañando piso tras piso hasta llegar a la sala, Denis se dirigió a la cocina y Jack comenzó a jalar a los hombres inconcientes a la casa en tanto Denis abrió todas las llaves de la estufa dejando salir el gas para salir de la cocina y dirigirse a la sala donde su hermano se encontraba viéndola parado a mitad de sala, camino a donde él se encontraba hasta quedar frente a él se miraron por unos instantes recordando todas las peripecias que juntos habían pasado aquellos recuerdos llenaron los ojos de Denis de lágrimas y sin resistir más Jack la abrazó a su hermana aquel momento hizo que olvidaran por completo todo lo que había ocurrido y lo que estaban a punto de hacer ese instante parecía perfecto solo ellos dos a mitad de la sala y así estuvieron por varios segundos para después separarse. Jack levanto su mano para limpiar las lágrimas de su hermana sin despagar un solo instante sus ojos de ella para después tomarse de la mano y caminar hacia la entrada en donde se pararon. Denis saco un encendedor prendiéndolo, en tanto Jack rompió la manga de su camisa vieja acercándola a donde se encontraba el fuego, cuando la manga se encendió Jack la dejo caer y enseguida todo se empezó a prender ellos miraron esa escena por un instante y salieron de la casa cerrando la enorme puerta de metal caminaron unos cuantos metros hasta que un enorme estruendo se dejó sentir. Las llamas había llegado a la cocina y al instante todo voló, la puerta no resistió y se abrió bruscamente dejando salir un poco de fuego, adentro la lumbre en pocos segundos se esparció en toda la casa hasta llegar a los cuartos donde ni Yanni ni su esposa o sus hijos lograron escaparse a ese cruel destino, desde afuera Jack y Denis veían con indiferencia lo que estaba ocurriendo, los gritos de dolor de los guardias seguridad se dejaban escuchar en todas partes, él llanto aterrador de los niños y sus padres no fue capaz de conmover a aquellos jóvenes que los visitaron con único fin de vengarse por todo lo que les habían hecho. Desde la ventana del cuarto de Yanni, él se aventó cayendo algunos metros lejos de los jóvenes que lo miraban sin interés alguno, en tanto él se revolcaba de dolor intentando apagar el fuego pero no lo logro dirigió su vista llena de dolor hacia los jóvenes pidiéndoles que lo ayudaran pero ellos ni siquiera movieron un dedo, miraron aquel hombre como si nada hasta que una vez más una explosión se sintió alcanzando a Yanni y consumiéndolo todo adentro; los gritos habían cesado, las llamas era intensas, la casa se iba destruyendo poco a poco y una vez más el silencio se hizo presente. La muerte esa noche había sido silenciosa nadie vio su rostro a excepción de Yanni que miro con mucho sufrimiento los ojos aquellos niños que le arrebataron todo…hasta la vida. *****Fin del Flashback***** El recuerdo de esos ojos llenos de sufrimiento hizo regresar al presente a Denis que miro a Jack sabía que desde ese día hasta el último suspiro de su vida lo amaría mientras él le daba los últimos detalles al plan que entre los dos estaban fraguando. El plan ya estaba trazado en menos de un mes robarían 50 bancos y estafarían a más de 40 millones de personas en todo el planeta. En la Iglesia de Brooklyn Jayson terminaba de contarle a Ruby lo que ocurrió el día que el padre Cornelius murió y lo que le ocurrió a los niños que vivían en la iglesia donde varios hombres de negro atacaron: - … notros nos escondimos en la ventilación de la iglesia desde ahí vimos como la vida del padre Cornelius se extinguió -. Jayson hizo una pausa cerrando los ojos y respirando fundamente.- Después de cuatro días un general nos encontró y nos llevó con él a la escuela militar en donde tampoco la pasamos muy bien -. Termino de explicar Jayson Ruby miraba completamente sorprendido al padre después de contarle semejante historia. - Ya entiendo… y que pasó con el padre David -. Después de un largo rato Ruby reaccionó El padre bajo su mirada paso saliva y comenzó a explicar: - Después escapar de la escuela militar estuve varios meses vagando yo solo hasta que llegue aquí encontrándome con el padre David, él me dio un hogar - Recuerdo que era muy bueno con todos -. Interrumpió Ruby recordando a su viejo amigo - Con el tiempo me di cuenta que el padre David sufría mucho, todas las noches se lamentaba y lloraba por no haber podido salvar a el padre Cornelius o a los niños… Ruby escuchaba atento esperándolo lo peor porque así era siempre. - Una noche me despertaron los gritos de sufrimiento del padre así que me dirigí a su recamara y cuando entre… -. Jayson hizo una pausa pasando saliva. – lo encontré con una soga en el cuello y arriba de una silla cuando intente correr para salvarlo aventó la silla… enseguida murió asfixiado. Ruby no daba crédito a todo lo que el joven padre le contaba, estaba pasmado con su relato, el padre levanto su mirada viendo a Ruby - Bien… platíqueme quien intenta matarlo -. Pregunto el padre - Eeehhh… así unos hombres de negro y por lo que entiendo se debe de tratar de los mismos sujetos que destruyeron la iglesia del padre Cornelius - y… que buscaban - Las cuatro piedras al parecer intentan reunirlas de nuevo - Ya entiendo así que esos hombres han regresado y no descansaran hasta encontrar las piedras -. El padre bajo su mirada y puso su mano en su barbilla para pensar - Oye amigo… verdad que me vas a dejar quedar aquí - Ehhh… si ven acompáñame te diré dónde te vas a quedar a dormir El padre comenzó a caminar entrando a la sacristía subieron las escaleras y el padre le indico cuál era su recamara para después dirigirse a su recamara cerró la puerta, se sentó en su cama, tomo el teléfono y marco dos números simultáneamente cuando le contestaron tomo aire profundamente y dijo: - El momento ha llegado el mal a regresado y los cinco elementos deben de ser reunidos de nuevo.

Edificio Zúrich: En Suiza se ubica uno de los más importantes entidades bancarias del mundo el Banco de Zúrich el cual se encuentra en el último piso de los más importantes edificios de todo el país adentro una decenas de personas están sentadas esperando su turno entre ellas una pareja con sobrepeso, ella leía un libro mientras él dormía recargado en el respaldo del sillón y roncaba. - Numero 18 pasar a caja 9 -. Una voz indicó que era el turno de la pareja con sobrepeso La esposa dejo su libro en el sillón y con ambas manos movió a su esposo para que despertara, después los dos se pararon y fueron hacia la caja que les habían indicado. Cuando los dos estaban frente a la caja No. 9 un estruendo como si se tratara de una bomba se escuchó en el banco provocando que todos los presentes a excepción de la pareja obesa se asustaran agachándose mientras del libro de la mujer obesa salían unas como lucecitas seguidas de un ruido extraño en ese instante los sistemas de seguridad se activaron, de las esquinas del banco salieron ametralladoras al igual que del centro todas con su respectivo sensor de movimiento pero algo raro ocurría daban vueltas y hacían extraños ruidos completamente fuera de control. La mujer obesa de su bolso sacó un arma y apunto hacia donde estaban las personas - Que nadie se mueva esto es un asalto un movimiento en falso y los matare a todos Afuera del banco, en la entrada uno de los guardias intento entrar al banco pero se encontró con una mortal trampa, al poner tan solo un pie dentro del banco los sensores del sistema de seguridad se activaron y enseguida miles de disparos salieron en contra del guardia que fue cruelmente acribillado, todos miraron con horror lo que le había pasado al guardia. - Que nadie se mueva sino quiere sufrir el mismo destino, cualquier movimiento que capte el sistema de seguridad dispara automáticamente -. Advirtió el hombre obeso Universidad de Brooklyn: Nancy se encontraba platicando con el quarterback del equipo de fútbol americano de la universidad quien se encontraba apoyado con una mano en un locker mientras Nancy estaba recargada en el locker frente al muchacho de 1.85 metros de altura y bien formado, de vez en tanto le sonreía muy coquetamente a lo lejos Lucy miraba aquella escena llena de celos y sin resistir más se dirigió a donde estaba Nancy al llegar se quedó parada a un lado de ellos sin que ellos se percataran de su presencia, enojada abrió su locker tapándose con la puerta. - Como puede ser posible que una niña tan linda como tú no tenga un hombre que la acompañe -. Aquel joven se acercó más a Nancy para mirarla a los ojos y comenzar a descender directo hacia los labios de ella - Lo mismo me dicen todos pero yo estoy esperando que un hombre fuerte y varonil como tú que me convenciera de ir con él a donde sea -. Dijo Nancy deteniendo un instante a él joven Lucy escucho lo que el joven le decía a Nancy completamente celosa así que enojada cerro de golpe su locker provocando que ambos voltearan sorprendidos hacia donde estaba Lucy quien miro al joven enojada y después miro a Nancy para después darse la vuelta y comenzar a caminar. Nancy empujo al joven para separar y poder ir detrás de Lucy - Espera Lucy no es lo que parece… no te pongas así solo es un juego Lucy al escuchar esto se detuvo, tenía los puños cerrados, el coraje y celos que sentía no la dejaban pensar con claridad así que bajo la mirada cerro los ojos por un instante y furiosa se dio la vuelta para ver a Nancy. En tanto el joven les veía algo confundido. - Entonces también juegas conmigo cuando estamos juntas Edificio Zúrich: El plan era perfecto estallar una granada Chaff que neutralizara y desconfigurará todos los sistemas eléctricos del banco por varios minutos mientras Jack y su hermana saqueaban el banco para salir después como si nada del edificio de Zúrich y por otro lado cualquier policía que quisiera intervenir moriría acribillado. Ambos se dirigieron a la cámara donde estaba la bóveda al llegar la puerta estaba abierta gracias a los efectos de la granada Chaff, los dos entraron y comenzaron a llenar sus botargas de dinero y lingotes de oro. Unas cuantas cuadras lejos del edificio Zúrich, 10 unidades de la policía incluido Korben Dallas se dirigían a ese edificio después de recibir una llamada reportando que en el banco se habían escuchado unos disparos. Universidad de Brooklyn: Nancy no sabía ni que decir estaba ahí parada mirando a Lucy buscando no decir nada tonto que provocara que su amada se enojara con ella, el joven camino a donde ellas estaban se detuvo a un lado de ellas. - Chicas tranquilas… no sabía que a las dos les gustaba tanto pero no se preocupen las dos pueden ser mis novias - ¿Qué? -. Volteo Lucy a ver sorprendida al joven Nancy no escucho lo que el joven dijo ya que estaba perdida pensando en que decir y mirando a Lucy. - te equivocas yo te he querido siempre todos los días de mi vida y no sería capaz de estar con nadie que no fueras tu Lucy dirigió su mirada a Nancy mirándola un poco más tranquila - No se preocupe ninguna de las dos yo solo seré capaz de amarlas a ambas -. El joven abrazo a las dos jóvenes mientras veía hacia enfrente con ojos soñadores Nancy por fin se percató de la presencia del joven y enojada se separó del muchacho jalando a Lucy de la mano, sin soltarla empezó a caminar, volteo a ver al joven para decirle. - Yo no me refería a ti si no a ella… lo siento eres guapo pero desafortunadamente no eres Lucy El joven se sorprendió tanto que se quedó boquiabierto. Edificio Zúrich: En la bóveda Denis y su hermano terminaron de llenar sus botargas y empezaron a caminar hacia la salida lentamente porque sus trajes estaban pesados no solo por el dinero y los lingotes de oro sino también por los dispositivos que traía para no ser detectados por los sensores del sistema de seguridad. En la entrada Korben y las unidades de policías llegaron, enseguida los policías entraron y el guardia del Edificio Zúrich se dirigió a ellos extrañado por verlos ahí. - Disculpen señores ¿que se les ofrece? - Recibimos una llamada donde reportaban que en el banco se habían escuchado unos disparos por eso estamos aquí -. Dijo Korben acercándose a donde estaba el guardia del edificio - Mmmmmm… creo que fue un engaño porque yo he estado aquí todo el día y no he escuchado nada Todos los policías se miraron y Korben se quitó el casco dejándolo sobre el escritorio de la recepción, miro aquel hombre por unos minutos y finalmente le dijo: - Le importa si voy a echar un vistazo El guardia miro a Korben y de reojo miro el enorme reloj que había detrás del capitán. - Si quiere ir a ver por mí no hay problema Korben se dirigió a los policías dándoles indicaciones que aquel que quisiera salir o entrar al edificio tenía que ser identificado, después el capitán se dirigió al elevador, entro y subió hasta el último piso. Universidad Brooklyn: Nancy y Lucy caminaron hasta el laboratorio de ciencias, Nancy abrió la puerta para que ambas entraran y después la cerró. Lucy se detuvo recargándose en una de las mesas de trabajo, Nancy al ver esto aprovecho para abrazarla por unos segundos para después recargar sus manos en la mesa sin separarse de Lucy. - No seas celosa yo solo vivo y respiro para ti Nancy termino de decir para dirigir su rostro a donde estaba Lucy para poder besarla pero antes de que pudiera hacerlo Lucy la tomó de los hombros aventando a Nancy para después caminar hacia la salida. - A dónde vas - No te importa -. Lucy estaba aún enojada abrió la puerta para salir y cerrarla de golpe Edificio Zúrich: Cuando Korben llego al banco salió del elevador y se dirigió a la entrada del banco cuando llego vio a un guardia parado junto a la pared con cara de asustado. - ¿Qué le ocurre?, ¿Qué hace ahí? -. Pregunto Korben El guardia lo volteo a ver tomo aire se separó de la pared. - Un… un… aaaa…ssss… salto… - ¿Qué ocurre no te entiendo nada? - Hay… un …aaaa…ssss… un asalto Por fin el guardia logro decirle lo que estaba pasando así que sacó su arma y se dirigió a la entrada del banco pero el guardia lo jalo antes de que Korben pudiera apenas asomarse adentro del banco. - Qué te pasa muchacho tengo que entrar El guardia le señalo con el dedo hacia donde estaba el cuerpo del guardia acribillado, el capitán miro el cuerpo y vio las cámaras que daban vueltas como locas y se zafo del guardia. - Hubo un error en el sistema disculpe por las molestias el sistema se reiniciará en 5 minutos Se escuchó una voz mecánica para que después todas las armas y cámaras se guardaran automáticamente adentro de las paredes, Korben se quitó la chaqueta y la lanzo dentro del banco pero nada ocurrió así que el capitán entro seguido muy de cerca por el guardia ambos entraron cuidadosamente buscando con la vista a los ladrones pero no vieron a nadie, Korben se quedó parado miro a uno de los presentes que seguía hincado en el suelo pero antes de preguntarle algo vio a dos hombres obesos que aparecían en una de las puertas, cuando los presentes los vieron empezaron a temblar al ver esto Korben entendió que ellos eran los ladrones así que les apunto. - Deténgase y pongan sus manos donde las pueda ver, están arrestados La pareja obesa no hizo caso y siguió caminando dirigiéndose a donde estaba el capitán y el guardia, Korben les volvió a decir que se detuvieran pero nada ellos no hicieron caso así que apuntó a las piernas de Jack y disparo pero nada ocurrió una vez más lo intento pero nada al verlos ya tan cerca retrocedió un poco. - ¡Deténgase! O tendré que tomar otras medidas -. Amenazó el capitán Los dos obesos no hicieron ni el menor caso, el guardia asustado dispara hacia Jack dándole en el estómago de donde salió un extraño ruido mientras se empezó a desinflar la botarga de Jack aquello llamado la atención de todos los presentes no podían creer lo que estaban viendo, el estómago del hombre obeso se estaba desinflando, al ver la distracción del capitán, Denis le lanzo su bolso el cual tenía cuatro lingotes, en tanto Jack dirigió su mano a su nuca, acto que percato Korben y apunto a la cabeza del hombre obeso, el bolso voló por los aires dando en su objetivo la cabeza del capitán quien no vio el bolso que se dirigía hacia él, el golpe noqueo al uniformado quien empezó a caer al suelo en tanto Jack saco rápido la escopeta que traía detrás de la espalda apunto y mientras caía el capitán disparo matando al guardia. Sin nadie más que se interpusiera en su camino la pareja levanto la bolsa y se dirigió al elevador. Adentro Denis inflo la botarga de Jack y le coloco cinta canela para que no se saliera el aire, cuando llegaron al piso de recepción los policías los vieron raros y se dirigieron hacia ellos pero el guardia los detuvo al ver que tomo sus identificaciones las introdujo en el identificador que el guardia traía y enseguida apareció la información de la pareja al ver los policías que eran embajadores de un planeta muy lejano los dejaron salir sin ningún problema, ellos abordaron su automóvil de lujo y se fueron, el guardia se retiró con la excusa que tenía que ir a ver qué había pasado con el capitán Korben. En las calles de Brooklyn un taxi se dirigía a la universidad de esta ciudad cuando llego se abrió la puerta dejando salir a un monje que traía la cabeza tapada entro al edificio y se dirigió a la Iglesia cuando llego pregunto por el paradero del padre Jayson al sacristán de la iglesia quien le dijo que no se encontraba así que el monje decidió esperar al padre hincándose y comenzando a rezar. Después del gran asalto que habían hecho Denis y su hermano entraron a la sala de su mansión cansados se quitaron las votarlas para después sentarse en el sillón Jack agachado mirando hacia abajo y Denis recargada en el respaldo del sillón mirando hacia arriba sumidos en sus pensamientos, él parecía distante como si no estuviera ahí algo lo estaba confundiendo aunque no sabía a ciencia cierta que era se sentía raro como si algo estuviera mal pero no sabía que era, Denis por otro lado estaba feliz todo había salido bien a pesar de que Korben apareció y que tuvieran que haberle dado el 20% del botín al hombre que se había hecho pasar por guardia del edificio, tomo aire profundamente, se enderezo mirando a su hermano sumido en esa confusión. - Jack estas bien - Eh… a si -. Jack se enderezó mirando a su hermana Denis lo miraba extrañada y sin más beso a su hermano así estuvieron unos segundos hasta que ella se separó de él al sentir la indiferencia de su enamorado, enojada comenzó a pararse del sillón pero Jack la tomo de la mano jalándola haciendo que ella se sentara de nuevo para besarla muy apasionadamente cuando se separaron se mirándose intensamente y una vez más se volvieron a besar esta vez el beso fue más profundo lleno de complicidad y más provocativo, en tanto él recostó a Denis en el sillón sin dejarla de besar después de un rato Jack se separó de ella mirándola completamente perdido en aquellos hermosos ojos casi negros sin resistirse más a su tentación se acercó a ella pero antes de besarla se detuvo en súbito, ella se enderezo un poco para poder besarlo pero él se separó lentamente mientras ella lo seguía sin despegar un solo instante los ojos de los labios de su amado quería besar aquellos labios que la provocaban cada vez que los besaba. Cuando ambos estaban sentados ella por fin lo alcanzo besándolo sintiendo el calor y el deseo que Jack despedía en aquel excitante beso, ella dirigió sus manos hacia la playera infiltrándose adentro de ella para después deslizar sus manos por el tórax de Jack quien se dejó invadir por miles de sensaciones que hacían que comenzara a perder el control y al mismo tiempo ella subía la playera para separarse de su amado y comenzar a quitarle la prenda, él levanto sus brazos mientras ella los recorría lentamente mientras sus miradas expresaban tanta pasión y deseo que sin perder un instante más se besaron para que sus labios demostraran lo que su deseo quería, con una mano ella aventó lejos la playera y con la otra tomo la mano de Jack que aun la tenía arriba, una vez más ambos se recostaron en el sillón y Denis empezó a besarle el cuello recorriendo cada centímetro mientras desliaba sus manos por los brazos de él hasta llegar al pecho con ambas manos tomo fuerza y se levantó de golpe. Jack rápido reacciono jalándola de la mano, ella quedo sentada arriba de él, quien comenzó a besarle el cuello haciendo que ella cerrara los ojos sumida en pasión mientras él con sus manos acariciaba con delicadeza los pechos de su amada, ella dirigió sus manos hacia el cinturón de él desabrochándolo, con fuerza arrebatárselo y aventarlo en tanto él acariciaba sus glúteos y ella acariciaba el abdomen de él para después separarse bruscamente de él dejándolo sentado, ella se dirigió hacia el elevador se dio la vuelta mirando a Jack que lo miraba contento y extasiado, con un dedo le indico sensualmente que la siguiera así que él se levantó para dirigirse hacia adentro del elevador ya adentro ella apretó un botón y la puerta se cerró, ellos en tanto se besaban mientras sus manos recorrían cada detalle de sus cuerpos parecían que estaban desesperados por expresar el deseo y cariño que se tenía. Un sonido anuncio que habían llegado al piso donde se encontraban las recamaras, se abrió la puerta y tomando del pecho a Jack, ella lo aventó hacia adelante casi corriendo se dirigió hacia afuera él la siguió alcanzándola dándole la vuelta para besarla y estrellarla en la puerta de una de las recamaras, esta vez ella acaricio la entrepierna de él quien al sentir esto se exalto un poco, ella fue poco o poco subiendo hasta encontrarse con el miembro del joven, lo acariciaba delicadamente mientras él sentía que en cualquier momento perdería el control así que rápido busco la perilla para poder entrar al cuarto pero estaba tan excitado que su cabeza no coordinaba sus movimientos y por más que la buscaba no la encontraba finalmente la abrió. Denis empezó a retroceder mientras sus manos desabrochaban el pantalón de su enamorado antes de poder llegar a la cama ella se giró bruscamente y aventó a la cama a Jack, se miraron por un instante perdidos ambos en deseo y placer para después ella dirigirse al él, recargo sus manos en la cama dejando a Jack en medio de ella para besarlo mientras el acostado empujaba su cuerpo hacia la cabecera de la cama y ella lo seguí hincada sobre la cama al llegar a las almohadas ella se acostó sobre de él quien le quito la blusa para después quitarle el sostén. Denis en tanto le besaba el cuello para que después él se girara sobre sí mismo dejándola debajo de él y poder besar los delicados pechos de la joven deslizándose explorando cada detalle del cuerpo de su enamorada hasta llegar a su ombligo y besarlo después con sus manos le quito el short que ella traía y acostándose arriba de ella para bésala mientras sus manos acariciaban cada milímetro sus bronceadas piernas llegando a la parte más delicada de ella la cual acaricio, ella al sentir esto dejo salir un leve gemido y él aumento el ritmo con que la acariciaba, ella dirigió sus labios al cuello de él quien le quito la última prenda que cubría el sensual cuerpo de ella al tenerla así miro aquel cuerpo que casi le podía gritar que quería más que no se detuviera así regreso a besarla mientras ella abría las piernas y pudo sentir el miembro excitado de Jack, ellos se besaban al mismo ritmo que sus manos acariciaban sus cuerpos ella permaneció con los ojos cerrados mientras Jack se quitó en un movimiento el pantalón y el bóxer y sin más coloco su miembro en la parte intima de ella para después moverse hacia adelante y entrar dentro de ella que al sentir esto abrió un poco más las piernas abrazándose fuertemente a él quien comenzó a salir y entrar poco o poco de ella quien besaba su cuello y de tanto en tanto dejaba salir un gemido lo cual provocaba que Jack aumentara de ritmo, los dos estaban sumidos en placer fuera de control sus cuerpos danzaban sensualmente, él se detuvo y ella giro quedando ahora arriba de él, ella ahora se movía para que él pudiera entrar y salir a placer en tanto el cuarto se llenaba de gemidos, deseo, placer de locura por fin sus cuerpos habían dejado salir lo que sentían cuando robaban un banco después de un rato él volvió a girar y aumento la velocidad de sus estocadas, ella al sentirse completamente invadida se abrazó con fuerza a él quien se movía envolviendo a ella en calor y en un deseo desenfrenado sus cuerpos vibraban en busca de un mismo camino demostrarse el enorme amor que sentían, él seguía entrando y saliendo hasta que no pudo resistir más y rápidamente saco su miembro de ella viniéndose fuera para después recostarse a un lado de ella boca abajo y minutos ambos se quedaron dormidos. El padre Jayson llegaba de una conferencia entro a su Iglesia, enseguida se percató de la presencia del monje quien se levantó y se destapo la cara dejando que el padre viera el rostro de un hombre albino aquel rostro hizo que al padre lo invadiera un escalofrío. - Buenas tardes amado hermano he venido aquí como mensajero de nuestro señor…-. Dorian se acercó al padre diciéndole tranquilamente. – El momento a llegado los cuatro elementos deben reunirse y el quito elemento debe ser hallado antes de sea demasiado tarde y el mal gobierne el reino de nuestro señor Aquellas palabras sorprendieron al padre quien tranquilo miro a Dorian notando en el algo extraño que le hacía sentir desconfianza, miedo y odio. - Lo siento amigo mío pero lo que buscas aquí no lo encontraras El padre camino pasando a un lado del monje se dirigió al altar. En tanto un enorme coraje invadió a Dorian y completamente fuera de si se dio la vuelta y antes de que pudiera hacer algo varias personas entraron a la iglesia la misa iba a comenzar. Dorian enfurecido salió de la iglesia entro al elevador estaba convencido que las piedras estaban en ese lugar así que estaba dispuesto a esperar a que la misa terminara para poder ir de nuevo a la iglesia y obligar al padre que le dijera donde estaban las piedras así que se dirigió a los pisos de arriba donde se encontraba la universidad al llegar a un piso salió del elevador y camino sin rumbo caminaba pensando mil y un cosas hasta que fue interrumpido por las gritos de alegría que se escuchaban al fondo. Aquellos ruidos llamaron la atención del albino que se dirigió a donde procedían al llegar miro un gimnasio en el cual se celebraba un partido de voleibol entro y enseguida algo atrajo su atención poderosamente se trataba de una joven jugadora que al instante lo hipnotizó no solo por su belleza si no por la fuerza y coraje con la que jugaba, Dorian estaba perdido mirando a la joven mientras ella brincaba y con ambas manos bloqueaba el balón dirigiéndolo hacia el lado de sus adversarias quienes no pudieron hacer nada anotando otro tanto para el equipo de Brooklyn en eso de las gradas los espectadores gritaron un nombre refiriéndose a la jugadora. - ¡Nancy, Nancy, Nancy…¡ Por un ínstate Dorian miro a las personas que estaban gritando para después dirigir su mirada de nuevo a Nancy y dirigirse a las gradas se sentó en primero fila muy cerca de donde estaba jugando ella no quería perderse ni un solo movimiento de la mujer que para él era el ser más hermoso del universo. El partido ya estaba decidido la impenetrable defensiva y la poderosa ofensiva del equipo de Brooklyn ya había aplastado al equipo contrario, todo gracias a su jugadora numero 1 Nancy, el balón lo tenía Nancy que se perfilaba para hacer un saque levanto su mano derecha acto que llamo aún más la atención de Dorian cuando vio la marca que tenía en su mano, aquella marca dejo perplejo al albino que dijo para sí mismo completamente feliz y complacido por el enorme descubrimiento que había hecho. - Encontré… por fin lo encontré… al quinto elemento Notas: La granada Chaff es un arma que al estallar desactiva o descompone todos los sistemas eléctricos que estén cerca de la explosión si quieren un poquito más de información esta granada sale en el videojuego de Metal Gear Solid.[Chapter 8] Aberración Nota Inicial: Hola a todos, aquí les traigo otro capítulo espero que les guste y sepan que de aquí para adelante las cosas se van a poner más intensas. Desde que era un bebé jamás conoció el amor de una madre, de un padre o de un hermano siempre vivió en las sombras porque su propia madre lo desterró de la luz por ser una aberración de la naturaleza (según la madre), vivía entre la basura, el polvo y la neblina de las ciudades antiguas. Las ratas, gatos y perros abandonados era lo único que conocía, nadie sabía de su existencia solo una mujer sordomuda perteneciente a una raza extraterrestre que carecía de forma humana, ella era quien lo cuidaba como uno más de sus decenas de perros. Nunca aprendió a hablar o a entender lo bueno o malo solo vivía por instinto aquel bebé con el tiempo se convirtió en casi un hombre y un día accidentalmente tuvo su primer contacto con otro ser humano cuando lo vio se sorprendió mucho porque a pesar de tener su misma forma había algo muy raro en él que lo hacía muy diferente su piel tenía un color medio rosado y la de él era completamente blanca, en su cabeza tenia pelo y él no tenía al principio pensó que estaba enfermo o herido así que se acercó a averiguar toco su piel con sus sucias manos pero no tenía nada al instante escucho un ruido raro y se separó rápidamente viendo a ese hombre con un objeto que él en su vida había visto. - ¡Aléjate o te mato! -. Gritó el hombre con un arma en la mano, él era fugitivo de la justicia que después de una persecución su auto se había colapsado y el para no morir dentro se aventó cayendo en ese lugar. El fugitivo miro sorprendido aquel joven extraño parecía monstruo alto, sin cabello, de piel blanca casi como si se tratara de un zombi, sin playera, con un pantalón rasgado que le llegaba a las rodillas y bastante delgado, vio que estaba asustado igual o más que él. - Hola siento a verte asustado… mi nombre es Evan, tú ¿cómo te llamas? -. Le dijo estirándole una mano para saludarlo El extraño joven lo miro sin entender nada era la primera vez que escuchaba a alguien hablar y para él eran ladridos desconocidos tal vez era un nuevo tipo de perro que solo existía allá arriba donde se escuchaba mucho ruido, él se acercó para oler a Evan que enseguida se exalto. - Hey… tranquilo que haces, aléjate -. Evan lo tomo por los hombros y lo aventó al suelo. – No te acerques que te crees -. Él levanto su mano y su dedo moviéndolo de un lado a otro en señal de \"no\". El extraño joven por fin le había entendido algo esa señal de \"no\" la hacia la mujer para que le entendiera que no hiciera algo, así que se quedó parado viendo al hombre para sentarse en el suelo. - Bueno… necesito que me ayudes a esconderme porque la policía me sigue injustamente… - No se mueva está bajo arresto por el robo a mano armada de un banco Se escuchó desde las sombras para después dejarse ver una patrulla de la policía de la ciudad de Nueva York, de ella descendieron dos hombres bien armados apuntando sus armas en contra del fugitivo, cuando los policías vieron al el extraño joven se sorprendieron mucho nunca vieron a una persona tan blanca. - ¡Usted!... ¡aléjese de ese criminal lentamente! -. Dijo unos de los policías El extraño joven miro curioso a los policías, aquellas cosas parecían divertidas ante sus ojos además de que eran bastante extrañas tenían unas pieles negras y sus cabezas no tenía ojos, el joven estaba fascinado con esos raros seres así que su curiosidad lo hizo empezar a caminar hacia ellos. Los policías se asustaron al ver que el joven se acercaba a ellos con una mirada indescifrable asustados apuntaron ahora al extraño joven - Por favor deténgase no camine o le dispararemos Aquellas palabras no significaron nada para el extraño y siguió caminando, los policías no sabían que hacer. - ¡Deténgase! o ¡dispararemos! El joven no se detuvo y uno de los policías disparo dándole en una pierna el joven al ínstate sintió un tremendo dolor que lo invadió pero por alguna extraña razón ese dolor se convirtió en coraje y después en furia, colérico camino hacia el uniformado que le disparo dándole en un brazo pero el joven no se detuvo esta vez se lanzó en contra del policía cayendo los dos al suelo ya ahí el hombre intento hacerlo a un lado pero no pudo la fuerza del joven era tremenda, el chico completamente fuera de si le quito el caso y comenzó a golpear la cara del policía con el casco, en tanto el otro policía miraba atónito lo que estaba pasando aquel muchacho golpeaba sin compasión al policía que rogaba por le ayudaran pero nadie acudía a salvarlo, cada golpe que daba hacia que la sangre brotara a la cara del joven finalmente reacciono Evan levanto su arma y disparo en contra del policía que estaba de pie él cual cayó muerto, aquel sonido también hizo que el extraño se detuviera se levantó del cuerpo ya sin vida del policía y cansado miro hacia arriba. Evan lo miro asustado, el rostro y cuerpo del joven estaban llenos de sangre, guardo su arma y camino hacia donde estaba el extraño pasó saliva y le extendió la mano. - Gracias por ayudarme… ¿cómo te llamas? El extraño al escuchar esa voz bajo la mirada viendo al fugitivo quien se asustó al mirar esos ojos, el joven bajo la vista viendo la mano estirada de Evan y el levanto la suya estrechándola con la de Evan que temblaba de miedo al ver esto él movió su mano en forma de saludo y sonrió para el extraño que lo miro sin entender nada finalmente lo imito sonriendo, el fugitivo soltó la mano del extraño y le dijo: - Mmmmmm… parece que el ratón te comió la lengua… bueno no importa de ahora en adelante te llamare… mmmmm… -. Evan pensaba en un nombre adecuado para el extraño joven que lo veía sin poder comprender lo que estaba pasando pero en el fondo él se sentía contento. – Mmmm… ya se… de ahora en adelante te llamare…Dorian. El sonido del silbato regreso a Dorian al presente, el partido había acabado y sin ningún problema Nancy y su equipo ganaron, todos fueron a felicitar a las jugadoras mientras que el albino observaba todo lo que la capitana del equipo hacía. Poco a poco todas las personas fueron saliendo del gimnasio a excepción de Nancy que estaba en los vestidores pensando en cómo le iba hacer para en contentar a Lucy. Que diablos le voy a decir para convencerla que nada más quería hacerle una pequeña broma como iba a saber que se enojaría tanto solo porque estaba dizque coqueteando con ese tarado mmmm… y ahora que… de seguro cuando llegue mis cosas están en el pasillo… o debe estar esperándome con un sartén en una mano y en la otra un bat de béisbol… si le llevo su comida favorita… no de seguro me la avienta a la cara… demonios que hago… Estaba tan concentrada pensando que no noto al monje que la vigilaba después de no llegar a una razonable solución, salió del gimnasio, entro al estacionamiento del edificio, entro en su carro mientras que Dorian seguía cada uno de sus pasos sin que ella lo notara. En Edificio Zúrich dos horas antes los clientes del banco bajaron al piso donde se encontraban los policías y asustados contaron todo lo que había pasado en el banco, al escuchar el relato los policías llamaron a una ambulancia y al jefe superior de las fuerzas policiacas de Suiza; cuando este hombre llego regaño a todos los uniformados que se excusaban diciendo que el guardia de seguridad del edificio les había dicho que no pasaba nada, el jefe superior ordeno que buscaran al guardia pero ya no estaba, mientras que el cuerpo del guardia del banco y Korben eran llevados a un hospital. Una hora más tarde apareció el dueño del edifico Zúrich diciendo que el hombre que describían como el guardia del edificio no coincidían con las del hombre que en realidad trabajaba en edificio. Media hora más tarde en la bodega del edifico fue encontrado el cuerpo sin vida del verdadera guardia de seguridad. Parecía este el crimen perfecto sin errores, llevándose todo y al parecer sin ninguna pista concreta. La tarde moría en la ciudad No. 10, en la mansión Dallas, Denis y su hermano permanecían acostados juntos sobre las cobijas hasta que súbitamente Jack despertó y enseguida un sentimiento extraño lo invadió, se sentó en la cama mientras pensaba la razón por la que se sentía así pero no sabía que era después de estar así por varios minutos se vistió, bajo al estacionamiento entro en su carro favorito y condujo sin rumbo fijo por las calles de la cuidad No. 10. Aunque estaba atento conduciendo su cabeza estaba en otro lado, algo en él no estaba nada bien. Después de conducir durante casi una hora y media estaba en Brooklyn sin ni siquiera pensarlo o darse cuenta entro al estacionamiento de uno de los edificios más viejos y pobres de esa ciudad bajo de su vehículo, se dirigió al elevador, marco el numero de un piso al azar, la puerta se cerró y él se sentó en una de las esquinas del elevador sumido en sus pensamientos tratando de encontrar la respuesta del porque se sentía así, las personas abordaban o se bajaban del elevador conforme subía el ascensor pero Jack no se dio cuenta de lo que estaba pasando a su alrededor. Después de subir hasta el último piso y bajar de nuevo el elevador se detuvo en el piso 573 la puerta se abrió, Jack se levantó del piso salió del elevador y con las manos en las bolsas del pantalón camino por los pasillos de ese piso sin tomar atención a lo que había en ese piso hasta que noto algo raro en el edificio y se detuvo, ese pasillo le era familiar como si antes ya hubiera estado ahí miro a su derecha viendo una puerta que tenía el nombre de FAM Dallas al instante se sorprendió y una sonrisa de oreja a oreja se dibujó en su rostro y el sentimiento raro que tenía ahora era como de felicidad o algo así estaba confundido y algo nervioso por qué ni él mismo lo sabía así que sin otra opción toco la puerta y enseguida la puerta se abrió. - ¿Qué haces aquí?… ¿Qué quieres?...-. Abrió la puerta Lucy que aún seguía enojada Enseguida la cara de felicidad de Jack se desvaneció. - ¿Hola?... -. Fue lo único que dijo sorprendido por la actitud de su hermana - Si vienes a buscar a Nancy no está… así que adiós -. Se despidió Lucy cerrando la puerta Jack al ver esto puso su pie para que Lucy no le cerrara y sin pensarlo dijo. - ¿Qué?... no… yo vine a buscarte a ti… bueno no estoy seguro -. Esto último lo dijo en voz baja. Lucy lo miro algo extrañada, le abrió de nuevo la puerta para que entrara y se dirigió a donde estaba la tetera. Jack cerró la puerta tras de sí quedándose parado a un metro de Lucy. - A que has venido a buscarme -. Le pregunto fríamente Lucy mientras tomaba la tetera de vidrio - Lucy yo… -. Jack no sabía ni que decir, no sabía ni porque estaba ahí. – ¿Cómo… estas? - Nancy me engaña Lucy no podía aguantar el coraje, celos y decepción que sentía sin más se lanzó a los brazos de su hermano dejando caer la tetera y llorando sin consuelo, Jack se sorprendió mucho y enseguida un extraño sentimiento lo invadió hasta que una fugaz imagen lo asaltó: En esa imagen estaban él y Lucy cuando eran niños abrazados mientras él le decía: \" No te preocupes yo siempre voy a esta contigo… siempre te protegeré\" - Yo… yo… pienso que… a la mejor viste mal porque yo conozco a Nancy desde que era una niña y sé que sería incapaz de traicionar a las personas que ama -. Fue lo único que le vino a la mente decir a Jack. Repentinamente Lucy se separó enojada de su hermano y de golpe se secó las lagrimas - Me estás diciendo mentirosa lo que me faltaba… si… como eres su amigo la defiendes verdad - ¿Qué?... no yo jamás te llamaría mentiros y lo que dices es imposible porque… porque… -. Jack estaba desesperado intentando convencer a su hermana de lo contrario. - … eres la única mujer hermosa, maravillosa e increíble que he conocido y aquel al que le entregues tu corazón y tu alma es el ser más afortunado del planeta y no concebiría la vida sin ti… a veces siento envidia por Nancy -. Jack hablaba rápido sin percatarse de lo que decía hasta que razono lo que había dicho y asustado se tapó la boca. Lucy en tanto se puso toda roja mirando incrédula a su hermano, abrió la boca para decir algo pero solo movió la cabeza diciendo que no y mirando más sorprendida a su hermano. - ¡¿Qué?! -. Finalmente dijo Lucy - ¿Eh?... yo… bueno… tu… eh… yo -. Jack estaba todo rojo mirando a su hermana buscando algo que decir hasta que la puerta se abrió. Se trataba de Nancy que los miro a los dos que estaban parados mirándose confundidos y completamente rojos. - De que me perdí Jack volteo a ver a Nancy y esbozó una gran sonrisa - De nada hermanita, le preguntaba a tu novia sobre… la inmortalidad de cangrejo - ¿Que? -. Pregunto Lucy para reaccionar rápidamente y decir.- aaaa… si los cangrejos muy interesantes… pero Jack ya ser iba… verdad - ¿Quién yo?... aaah… si es verdad… adiós Lucy… adiós hermanita Jack salió casi corriendo del departamento se metió al elevador sin percatarse de la presencia del monje que estaba escondido en un pilar, Jack subió a su carro dándole un golpe con la palma de su mano al volante, se recargo en el respaldo del asiento mirando hacia arriba y enojado dijo: - ¡Diablos!... soy un idiota Dorian permanecía escondido pensando en que podía hacer, tenía varias opciones pero sabía cuál fuera de todas seria atrapar al quinto elemento se acercó tocando a la puerta. Adentro Nancy se encontraba recogiendo los vidrios de la tetera mientras miraba hacia la puerta de su recamara donde estaba Lucy encerrada cuando escucho que tocaban la puerta, se levantó y fue a abrir. - Si diga -. Nancy vio al monje reconociéndolo como el mismo que estaba en el partido de vóleibol. – Lo conozco Dorian miraba feliz a Nancy tenia tantas emociones en su pecho que con mucho trabajo lograba contenerse. - Buenas noches señorita… disculpe que venga a interrumpirla pero… el padre Jayson me ha enviado, me permite pasar Nancy miro un poco desconfiada a Dorian esos ojos del albino no le daban confianza y su extraña sonrisa la confundía y asustaba. -¿El padre Jayson?... mmmm… no lo conozco… tal vez se equivocó de departamento, no quiero ser grosera pero tengo algunas cosas que hacer… así que hasta luego-. Nancy cerró la puerta dejando a Dorian afuera, ella en tanto fue a terminar de recoger los vidrios del suelo. En el estacionamiento donde vive Lucy, el hombre que ayudo a los hermanos Dallas con el asalto al banco Zúrich se encontraba hablando por celular, ese hombre era moreno, de mediana estatura de cabello negro y ojos cafés su nombre Anthony el cómplice y compañero de los hermanos Dallas, cuando colgó se dirigió al elevador directo al piso 573. Frente a la puerta del departamento de Lucy se encontraba Dorian con el rostro tapado envuelto en coraje y una enorme cólera que no pudo soportar, enloquecido le dio una tremenda patada a la puerta haciéndola volar por los aires, completamente fuera de sí entro al departamento mirando con odio a Nancy que se encontraba en cuclillas terminando de recoger los vidrios, enseguida ella se levantó tomando la escoba. - ¿Qué es lo que quiere? vallase o llamare a la policía Dorian respiraba profundamente tratándose de calmarse pero tanto el coraje que sentía que fuera de control saco su bastón eléctrico lo encendió dirigiéndose a donde esta Nancy quien esquivaba con mucho trabajo los golpes que lanzaba el monje. Cuando pudo quedar detrás del monje lo golpeo con la escoba rompiéndosela en la espalda, el monje enfurecido se dio la vuelta tocando con el bastón a Nancy que no resistió la descarga eléctrica y cayó al suelo casi al punto del desmayo, Dorian gritaba lleno de cólera, enojado acerco el bastón al cuerpo de Nancy electrocutándola, ella gritaba de vez en cuando llena de dolor mientras Dorian comenzó a reírse. Adentro en la recamara Lucy permanecía escuchando lo que afuera estaba pasando, quería salir a ayudarla pero aún estaba enojada con Nancy y por otra parte tenía que encontrar una forma para no salir también lastimada o meterse en más problemas así que espero con los ojos cerrados. Dorian despego el bastón del cuerpo de la joven se agacho acariciándole el rostro mirándola indescriptiblemente, estaba ahí mirando su cuerpo completamente hipnotizado hasta que se escuchó como un arma se cargaba Dorian se levantó girándose y viendo a Anthony en la entrada del departamento. - Aléjate de ella maldito engendro. Nota Final: Gracias por leer y si deseas comentar estas en todo tu derecho.[Chapter 9] Despistado Nota Inicial: Hola a todos antes que nada, gracias por visitarme y sin más rodeos pasemos a la acción. En el edificio Cuentiton, Dorian acariciaba el rostro de la joven mirándola indescriptiblemente, estaba ahí viendo el cuerpo completamente hipnotizado hasta que se escuchó como un arma se cargaba Dorian se levantó girándose y viendo a Anthony en la entrada del departamento. - Aléjate de ella maldito engendro. Dorian enseguida asocio esa escena con la del policía que le había disparado en aquella ocasión que conoció a Evan así que una vez más la cólera lo invadió, encendió de nuevo su bastón y se lanzó en contra de Anthony, a unos cuantos centímetros de que el monje llegara a donde estaba disparo… el bastón cayó al suelo, un enorme silencio invadió el departamento hasta que el grito lleno de odio y completamente fuera de sí de Dorian corrompió el silencio levanto la mano izquierda llena de sangre ya que con ella había detenido el disparo, cerro la mano descargando toda su fuerza en la cara de Anthony que cayó al suelo, enfurecido comenzó a patear el cuerpo del hombre que en aire agarro uno de los pies del monje jalándolo con todas sus fuerzas y derribándolo. - Corre Nancy, Corre -. Gritó Anthony subiéndose arriba del cuerpo de Dorian y apuntando su arma a la cabeza del monje. En ese instante Lucy salio corriendo de la habitación levanto con mucho esfuerzo a Nancy que se colgó del cuello de su compañera y juntas salieron lo más rápido posible del departamento mientras que Dorian miraba imponente como se iban, enojado logro tomar su bastón tocando a Anthony que soltó el arma y se separó del monje quien tomo el arma, se levantó y disparo a su enemigo dándole cerca de las costillas, Dorian se acercó a él levanto su pie dejándolo caer con todas sus fuerzas en la herida de su enemigo que gritó de dolor, repitió varias veces el castigo sacando mucha sangre a Anthony, Dorian vio con alegría el cuerpo de su víctima levanto el arma disparando una vez más dándole en una pierna la cual piso lastimándolo más, el monje levanto el bastón electrocutando el cuerpo de su enemigo una vez más empezó a reír mientras los gritos de dolor de Anthony se escuchaban en todo el piso. Adentro del elevador Lucy trataba de hacer reaccionar a Nancy pero ella no respondía asustada escucho los dos disparos seguidos de los gritos de Anthony, asustada movió y llamaba a Nancy pero ella no reaccionaba. En el departamento Dorian miro feliz a Anthony se inclinó colocando el arma en la cabeza de su enemigo quien cerró los ojos y sin más el monje disparo matando al instante al cómplice de los hermanos Dallas. Dorian miraba feliz el cuerpo sin vida de Anthony se había desecho del obstáculo que le impedía ir tras Nancy y Lucy, el monje tiro el arma, dirigiéndose a la salida viendo hacia donde está el elevador y noto que Lucy lloraba abrazando a Nancy. Cuando Lucy vio al albino asustada se levantó y rápidamente apretó un botón que enseguida cerró la puerta del elevador, al ver esto el monje corrió para impedir que la puerta se cerrara pero no llego a tiempo enfurecido golpeo con sus puños el elevador para después correr a toda velocidad hacia el siguiente piso en busca del otro elevador. En tanto el elevador en el que estaba Nancy y su hermana llego al estacionamiento, cuando este se abrió Lucy miro a su alrededor pero no había nadie que pudiera ayudar asustada rápidamente tomo de los brazos a Nancy y la empezó a jalar hacia donde estaba su carro con mucho esfuerzo Lucy subió a su hermana al vehículo, lo encendió y salió a toda velocidad del edificio. Adentro del edificio Dorian había llegado al estacionamiento busco en todo el lugar a las hermanas Dallas pero no las encontró enfurecido grito a todo pulmón y resignado se retiró del lugar. Un gran operativo había en el edificio Cuentinton ya que en piso 573 encontraron el cadáver de un hombre al cual la policía de Brooklyn ya lo había identificado como Anthony Carter promotor de ventas de una empresa importante del planeta Imega. - Sargento necesita ver esto -. Gritó uno de los policías Cuando el Sargento se acercó al policía vio el arma que tenía en la mano. - Es el arma con la que mataron a este hombre pero las huellas que tiene el arma no coinciden con ninguna del registro y mucho menos con quienes viven en el departamento.- explicó el policía al Sargento - Mmmm… ¿Quiénes viven aquí? -. Pregunto el sargento - Dos jóvenes estudiantes de la universidad de Brooklyn… Nancy Dallas y su hermana Lucy - Búsquenlas para que declaren -. Ordenó el sargento Unas horas antes en el hospital de Zúrich, Korben seguía en coma pero entre sueños veía cosas que no recordaba haber vivido: En aquellos recuerdos veía borrosamente a cinco niños formando un circulo alrededor de él jugaban entre sonrisas y canciones cuando se detuvieron los niños se soltaron y corrieron a abrazar a una mujer que no logro distinguir, a acepción de una niña que estaba parada junto a él se inclinó recostando su cabeza en las piernas de Korben. - Papá adivina que hoy fuimos con el padre Cornelius a Egipto él nos dijo que tú y mamá salvaron al mundo y que ahora es nuestro turno… papá me escuchas… papá… por favor… papá escúchame… papá… Los llamados de aquella niña lo hicieron despertar, Korben se enderezó pero no pudo reconocer el lugar, se levantó viendo que traía una bata, busco su ropa pero no la encontró y finamente entro el Oficial Superior de las fuerzas policiacas de la tierra el cual estaba enfurecido. - ¡Korben Dallas!... en qué demonios pensabas… se supone que debías haber detenido a los ladrones… no ponerte a dormir… porque no subiste al banco con todos los policías -. Gritaba el general - Me engañaron, un guardia dijo que no estaba pasando nada por eso decidí subir solo -. Contesto tranquiló Korben - El guardia que lo engaño era cómplice de los ladrones como demonios dejaste que te engañaran. - Lo siento señor pero no lo sabía… - Será mejor que te vistas y te dirijas a Brooklyn a ocurrido un asesinato en el Edificio Cuentinton espero que no lo eches a perder y atrapes al responsable -. El superior dejo la ropa del capitán en la cama y se retiró. - Sí señor. El capitán Dallas llego a la escena del crimen en el edificio Cuentinton los policías terminaron de recoger las ultimas evidencias cuando se encontraron con Korben. - Capitán Dallas gusto verlo… aunque llego tarde -. Dijo el sargento - ¿Qué ocurrió aquí? porque se llevaron el cuerpo tenía que revisarlo - Por lo que veo tuvo problemas en su visita a Suiza El capitán Korben frunció el ceño y miro el departamento buscando pistas por sí mismo. - Se trata de un asesinato en el suelo hay cuadro casquillos de un arma lo que indica el asesino venia armado por lo que deduzco debió dispar a los residentes del departamento uno debió de huir el otro murió y el asesino muy seguramente debió ir tras el otro... no es así-. Dijo Korben mirando al sargento a su lado. - En la escena del crimen hubo un hombre sin registro, las dos jovencitas que viven aquí y un hombre llamado Anthony Carter que fue el que murió. Se encontraron tres tipos de sangre el primero fue de una de las residentes del edificio, el segundo del hombre desconocido y la tercera del hombre que falleció. - Ya encontraron a los residentes del departamento - No capitán desaparecieron son dos hermanas de apellido Dallas - ¿Dallas? -. Korben se quedó pensativo. – El hombre que murió qué relación tenía con ellas - Ninguna Capitán, el hombre era un gran empresario del planeta Imega y ellas son estudiantes. El Capitán al oír el planeta Imega miro sorprendido al sargento. - Tiene alguna foto del empresario -. Preguntó Korben mientras indagaba por el departamento. El sargento saco la foto que había tomado del cuerpo sin vida de Anthony, Korben se acercó al sargento para ver la foto y al instante quedo pasmado. - Reúna a su equipo sargento y síganme… Una hora antes en la Mansión Dallas: El timbre sonaba después de unos segundos un robot fue a abrir la puerta. - Familia Dallas que es lo que se le ofrece -. Se escuchó decir a la voz robótica mientras que escaneaba a la persona que se encontraba en la entrada, al identificarla comenzó decir. – Intruso, intruso, intruso, intruso -. Mientras giraba frente a la entrada. En ese momento el elevador llego a el piso de donde salio Jack quien miro alegre a Lucy que estaba en la entrada, camino unos cuantos pasos y noto que algo extraño tenía su hermana al ver que estaba llorando. Lucy permanecía en la entrada esperando que el robot la dejara pasar, al tener cerca a su hermano comenzó a decir tristemente. - Hermano por favor ayúdame… Jack ordenando al robot retirarse y miro preocupado a su hermana - Nancy…Jack…Nancy…está herida -. Lucy termino de decir lanzándose a los brazos de su hermano Jack pudo sentir el enorme dolor que su hermana sentía, correspondió el abrazo y tomo aire. - En donde esta Nancy…que le hicieron -. Por fin dijo Jack Lucy enseguida se separó de él, lo tomo de la mano llevándolo hacia el estacionamiento, al llegar ella abrió la puerta trasera del automóvil, Jack se acercó mirando a Nancy desmayada la tomo entre sus brazos llevándola rápidamente al elevador que estaba en la entrada de la mansión. Desde la cocina Denis vio sorprendida lo que estaba pasando así que rápidamente se dirigió al piso donde se encuentran los cuartos con un botiquín de primero auxilios. Jack y Lucy entraron al elevador llegando en un instante al último piso donde se encuentran los cuartos, salieron viendo a Denis que estaba en la entrada de uno de los cuartos esperándolos, Jack entro a el cuarto colocando a Nancy en la cama para que Denis curara las heridas, al terminar los tres salieron del cuarto dejando a Nancy descansar, subieron al elevador y bajaron a la cocina. En la cocina Jack y Lucy se sentaron junto a la mesa mientras que Denis servía té y galletas. El ambiente era tétrico nadie decía nada y Lucy seguía llorando. - ¿Qué ocurrió? ¿Quién les hizo esto? -. Pregunto Denis después de ver un poco más tranquila a su hermana. - Un monje -. Fue lo único que dijo Lucy. Jack y su hermana se miraron interrogantes para después mirar a Lucy. - Un hombre que no conozco nos ayudó a escapar, pero…-. Lucy miraba fijamente a la taza de té, paso saliva y sin quitar la vista de la taza comenzó de nuevo a llorar. – El monje…él…lo mato…yo no sabía que hacer estaba asustada -. Lucy cerró los ojos y se lanzó a los brazos de su hermano que estaba a un lado de ella. Jack miraba conmovido como lloraba Lucy. - ¿Qué le hicieron a Nancy? -. Dijo Denis Lucy al escuchar la voz de Denis se separó de Jack mirándolo un poco avergonzada lo miro por unos instantes y después se lanzó a abrazar a Denis que estaba del otro lado. - No lo sé, cuando escuche que el hombre que nos ayudó grito que huyéramos salí de mi recamara hacia donde estaba Nancy -. Lucy trataba de controlar su llanto pero el recuerdo de lo ocurrido no la dejaba pensar bien o tranquilizarse. – Ella aún estaba consiente pero cuando llegamos a la salida se… se… desmayo -. Termino de decir Lucy sin consuelo alguno. Denis y su hermano se miraron buscando alguna respuesta hasta que el timbre sonó y dirigieron su mirada al pequeño monitor que esta junto a la puerta del elevador. En la recepción de la Mansión Dallas la puerta es abierta por el robot. - Familia Dallas que es lo que desea -. El robot dijo al abrir la puerta. - Se encuentra Jack o Denis -. Dijo la voz de un hombre. - ¿Quién lo busca y con qué objetivo? -. Pregunto el robot enseguida de la cabeza le salió una pequeña cámara grabando a las personas que estaban frente al robot. El hombre miro a su alrededor para después ver adentro de la mansión. - Soy el capitán Korben Dallas, mis compañeros y yo venimos a visitarlos -. Se expresó tranquilamente el hombre. En la cocina los hermanos vieron sorprendidos la imagen del capitán y una decena de hombres bien armados en la entrada de su mansión, se miraron y sin más dieron la orden de que los dejaran pasar en tanto Lucy regreso a la recamara donde esta Nancy mientras que Denis y su hermano bajaron por el elevador hacia la recepción donde los policías los estaban esperando. Cuando Denis y su hermano llegaron a la recepción se tomaron de la mano llenándose de tranquilidad, al mirar al capitán Dallas lo saludaron amablemente y enseguida el capitán comenzó a decir. - Saben es extraño en un día el banco de Zúrich es robado y en el edificio Cuentinton aparece el cuerpo sin vida de quien ayudo a los ladrones del banco a escapar, en un departamento de la Familia Dallas igual que ustedes… me pregunto si es coincidencia o ustedes tiene algo que ver. Denis y Jack se miraron esbozando una gran sonrisa. - Capitán… Capitán… una vez más viene a mi casa a levantar falsos en contra mía… que ocurre tuvo un mal día -. Dijo Jack tratando de aguantar la risa al recordar lo que hicieron para robar y escapar del banco. - ¿Dónde están las hermanas Dallas?… y no nieguen que las conocen porque te vi llegar con ellas a la fiesta -. El capitán no se dejaba intimidar así que comenzó a preguntar. - No pensaba negarlas capitán… es ilógico lo que usted piensa… dos mujeres inocentes robar el banco… me disculpara pero creo que se equivoca -. Respondió el aludido. - ¡Ah! entonces dices que fueron ustedes - ¿Qué? -. Se sorprendió Denis. - Usted está mal nosotros no tuvimos nada que ver y si usted ha venido a culparnos de un delito que no cometimos exigimos la presencia de nuestro abogado -. Se defendió Denis. - ¡Arréstenlos! -. Ordeno Korben. - ¡¿Qué?! Esto es injusto no se atrevan a tocarme o… Antes de que Jack dijera algo más Denis apretó su mano tranquilizándolo. Los policías arrestaron a los hermanos, los subieron a una patrulla llevándolos a la comisaría de la ciudad No. 10; poco rato después llegaron los abogados de los hermanos Dallas, que al cabo de una hora y ya entrada la media noche los liberaron sin ningún problema, todas las sospechas del capitán Dallas habían sido muy bien maquilladas por los abogados. Para empezar presentaron pruebas donde se demostraba que todo el día los hermanos Dallas estuvieron en \"Dallas Corporation\", la conexión que había entre los hermanos y Anthony Carter fue negada al demostrar que pertenecían a diferentes empresas y que ni siquiera se conocían; por último el celular que traía Anthony no tenía ningún indicio de haber tenido contacto con los hermanos. El capitán Korben se disculpó dejando ir a los hermanos, estaba furioso pero estaba seguro de una cosa, por alguna extraña razón sentía que los hermanos Dallas estaban detrás del asalto al banco de Zúrich. Son las seis de la mañana hora de las noticias más relevantes, así que comencemos. Ayer fue asaltado el banco de Zúrich la policía no tiene ninguna pista de los culpables ya que su cómplice fue hallado muerto en un edificio en Brooklyn, los testigos dicen a ver visto un o monje salir del edificio se cree que él es el asesino. En tanto los residentes del lugar donde ocurrieron los hechos se encuentran desaparecidos. En otras noticias… - ¿Un monje? -. Se cuestionó Jayson para apagar la televisión salir de la iglesia y dirigirse a la mansión Dallas. Nota final: Eso es todo por el día de hoy espero que haya sido de su agrado este capítulo y nos vemos en la próxima, gracias.[Chapter 10] Dilema entre Hermanos Nota inicial: Hola a todos, gracias por visitar este espacio y aquí les traigo otro emocionante capítulo de esta historia espero que sea de su agrado. Ella se encontraba en un lugar oscuro, a lo lejos se oía el llanto de un hombre que la asustaba y la hacía estremecer con sus manos busco algo que le pudiera decir donde estaba pero no encontró nada atemorizada camino hacia donde provenían los gritos hasta que logro ver una luz y camino hacia ella. Los gritos se oían más aterradores hasta que un último quejido se dejó escuchar después de eso solo hubo silencio hasta que una música se comenzó a escuchar, al llegar vio llena de horror la macabra escena que se suscitaba frente a ella, se trataba de una enorme bodega con estantes llenos de objetos de tortura y armas militares, el piso lleno de sangre, un olor como si se tratara de azufre que hacia el ambiente más tétrico y en centro una mesa de la cual escurría sangre, colgado por encima de la mesa un cuerpo sin vida tenia marcas de que había sido torturado hasta la muerte, la cara estaba irreconocible, el pecho perforado y atravesado por un hacha y finalmente acostado sobre la mesa el general Beristaín que permanecía con los ojos cerrados mientras tarareaba la extraña canción que estaba de fondo; a los lejos los ojos llenos de horror de la niña no daban crédito a lo que veía paso saliva y miro como la cabeza del cuerpo del hombre muerto se desprendía cayendo al suelo, ella siguió con la mirada como la cabeza rodaba hasta done estaba ella y vio completamente sumergida en horror que el miembro cercenado que no tenía ojos ni dientes asustada grito provocando que el general Beristaín abriera sus ojos para mirar colérico a la pequeña niña que había descubierto su ruin crimen… Aquella escalofriante mirada hizo despertar súbitamente a Nancy de su pesadilla misma que desafortunadamente había sido un triste capítulo en su vida que trataba de olvidar pero hacia unos días esa pesadilla se había apoderado de sus sueños, ese traumático momento de su vida cuando encontró el cuerpo destrozado del comandante Joseph después de que este había retado las órdenes del general Beristaín. Nancy se enderezo, tomo aire profundamente tratando de olvidar esa horrible mirada, ella se extrañó un poco al sentir que alguien dormía junto a ella cuando miro hacia su derecha se percató que se trataba de Lucy que dormía sobre las cobijas, sin hacer mucho ruido Nancy se levantó de la cama para después con la cobijas tapar a Lucy la miro por un instante con una enorme sonrisa en la cara y sin más salió de la recamara subió al elevador cerrando la puerta adentro vio un reloj donde le indicaba que eran las 2:33 p.m. hora de la comida así que el elevador se dirigió a la cocina, cuando la puerta se abrió vio a Denis y Jayson comiendo en completo silencio. - Órale pues ¿quién se murió? Pregunto Nancy haciendo que los presentes voltearan a verla. - Hermana que milagro creí que ya no ibas a despertar… o se te pegaron las cobijas–. Comenzó a hablar Jayson mientras esbozaba una gran sonrisa. -Ven siéntate de seguro tienes hambre -. Él camino hacia el microondas de donde saco un suculento platillo. – Anda siéntate tenemos muchas cosas de que hablar -. Se sentó junto a la mesa y a su lado coloco el plato de comida. - Y… ¿Jack?... ¿Dónde está? Denis suspiro y miro a su hermana. - Jack subió por las escaleras les llevaba de comer Nancy al escuchar eso se sentó tranquilamente junto a la mesa a comer junto a sus hermanos. Después de subir varios pisos por las escaleras eléctricas Jack llego a la recamara donde se encontraba Lucy, abrió la puerta muy silenciosamente, jalo aire con todas sus fuerzas para poder gritar pero se detuvo al ver en la cama a Lucy durmiendo enseguida la cara de Jack se llenó de ternura al mirar a su hermana durmiendo, así estuvo mirándola por un par de minutos hasta que dejo la comida en el buró y camino hacia la cama. En la cocina solo el ruido de los cubiertos se escuchaba. - ¿Por qué mandaste a un monje loco a matarnos? -. Preguntó Nancy haciendo círculos con la cuchara en la comida. – Dime Jayson ¿Por qué? Jayson termino de comer recogió sus trastes los llevo al lavaplatos para después recargarse en la máquina y miro al cielo tomando aire. - Yo no hice tal cosa -. Finalmente dijo Jayson. – Ese monje estaba esperándome en la iglesia venia en busca de las cuatro piedras. - Y entonces porque apareció en mi departamento -. Nancy miro a su hermano un poco enojada. - No se Nancy te equivocas yo no lo mande contigo… el sacristán me dijo que el monje andaba merodeando por la universidad. - Tal vez él vio algo en ti que le hizo pensar que tú le entregarías las piedras -. Intervino Denis mirando a su hermana que estaba sentada del otro lado de la mesa enfrente de ella. En la recamara Jack se detuvo junto a la cama donde se encontraba Lucy aun durmiendo, él la miro un instante hipnotizado por su belleza y por lo que le hacía sentir cuando la miraba. Perdido en ella comenzó a descender lentamente para poder besarla coloco sus manos a ambos lados del cuerpo de su hermana recargándose en la cama y a unos cuantos centímetros se detuvo mirándola confundido, por un lado quería besarla para poder despejar las dudas que en él habían surgido y por otro lado sabía que estaba mal porque traicionaría a Nancy y a Denis, así estuvo pensando en lo que estaba bien o mal, enojado cerro los ojos se dio valor y tomo la decisión de que la besaría. - Uno… -. Comenzó a contar Jack. – dos… tres Cuando contó hasta tres cerro los ojos y beso a Lucy, por un instante se sintió en la gloria estaba maravillado con el rose de sus labios con los cálidos labios de la mujer que para él era perfecta, después un rato abrió los ojos mirando los hermosos ojos de Lucy que había despertado con aquel beso, él estaba en otro mundo perdido ahora en esos ojos verdegrises hasta que un tremendo dolor lo invadió ya que Lucy al sentir lo que su hermano había hecho le soltó una tremenda cachetada dejando roja la mejilla de Jack. - ¡aaahuuu!... -. Se escucha decir a Jack adolorido Jayson y sus hermanos se encontraban pensando en que había ocurrido, cuando Denis termino de comer espero a que Nancy terminara para poder recoger los trastes. Cuando termino los tres se dirigieron a la sala principal y se sentaron en los sillones. - Pienso…-. Comenzó a hablar Jayson. – Que el monje no solo buscaba las cuatro piedras sino también al quinto elemento. - Eso es imposible todos saben que el quinto elemento está muerto al igual que el único hijo que tenía -. Dijo Nancy - Tal vez… pero si buscaban los cuatro elementos quiere decir que saben cómo funcionan y por lo tanto conocen cual es la marca que lleva el quinto elemento hablo Denis - Exacto si saben tanto entonces lo que busca es poder conquistar el universo -. Jayson se exalto un poco y continúo diciendo. – Y por eso te siguió hasta tu casa porque piensa que tú eres el quinto elemento, mmmm… no se tal vez vio la marca de tu muñeca Los tres quedaron pensando tratando de imaginar cual era la verdadera razón del monje así estuvieron hasta que los tres dirigieron su mirada hacia el elevador al ver que se abría dejando ver a Lucy cruzada de brazos aparentemente enojada y Jack todo nervio mirando hacia el suelo y su mejilla roja con la marca de la mano de Lucy. Denis, Nacy y Jayson los miraron sorprendidos al ver la escena hasta que Nancy no soporto más y comenzó a reír contagiando a Denis y Jayson que reían por lo patético se veía Jack, en tanto Lucy camino hacia el sillón sentándose al lado de Nancy y muy seriamente miro a sus hermanos. - ¿Qué es lo que vamos hacer? Posiblemente a hora la policía nos debe de estar buscando y de seguro nos culpan de la muerte de ese hombre -. Lucy interrumpió las risas de sus hermanos. Los cinco se miraron serios y pensativos buscando una solución. - Estuve pensando -. Empezó a decir Jack. - Cuando estábamos en la comisaría -. Salio del elevador dirigiéndose a donde esta Lucy le dio el plato de comida para después dirigirse al sillón que estaba enfrente de Nancy para sentarse junto a Denis. Miro a sus hermanos y continúo. – Que Jayson puede hablarle a Korben y decirle que ellas llegaron a la iglesia para esconderse del sujeto que mató a Anthony y que preferiste no dar parte a la policía para que los medios de comunicación no hicieran ruido y así el sujeto no las volviera a encontrarlas. Los hermano a excepción de Denis lo miraron sorprendidos era una buena idea y deslindaba a Denis y Jack de toda sospecha. - Increíble Jack en un principio creí que tu cerebro solo servía de adorno pero ahora veo que eres… aaaaa… algo inteligente -. Jayson se burló de Jack. Todos a excepción de Jack se miraron tratando de aguantar la risa. - Ja ja ja -. Se rio con ironía el aludido - En ese caso yo los llevare a la iglesia para que le hables a Korben estaría bien que le dijeras que fuera lo más discreto posible -. Denis se levantó y se dirigió al elevador. Todos se levantaron y siguieron a Denis a excepción de Nancy. - Oigan… y que tal si la policía, los está vigilando -. Dijo Nancy desde el sillón. Los hermanos se detuvieron y voltearon a ver a Nacy. - Mmmmm… es verdad pero sé que podemos hacer síganme -. Comentó Jack. En el edificio de enfrente de la Mansión Dallas el capitán Korben permanecía atento a todo lo que pasa en el exterior de la mansión, estaba atento a las personas que entraban o salían de la mansión para suerte de los hermanos Dallas justo cuando llego a vigilarlos el padre Jayson ya estaba adentro de la mansión por lo que no logro el capitán ver cuando el padre llego a la mansión. Afuera la limosina de Jack y Denis salía así que Korben se levantó rápidamente y comenzó a correr directo al estacionamiento donde está su motocicleta y comenzó a seguir la limosina. Minutos más tarde un automóvil llego a la Mansión el conductor hizo sonar el claxon y poco después Jayson, Lucy y Nancy abordaron el automóvil ya adentro el conductor se presentó como Tomas hermano menor de Anthony cuando los hermanos escucharon esto se miraron sorprendidos recordando que Jack había mencionado ese nombre refiriéndose al hombre que el monje había matado. - No puedo creerlo Anthony era tu hermano -. Pregunto Lucy algo incrédula e intentando averiguar porque él estaba en ese lugar. - Si así es… él es muy valiente al dar su vida para que ustedes escaparan...-. contesto Tomas guardando silencio para después continuar. – Lo comprendo solo seguía ordenes… yo hubiera hecho lo mismo por los hermanos Dallas no dudaría en sacrificar mi propia vida. Los hermanos Dallas se miraron sorprendidos para mirar ahora al conductor. - ¿Cómo que seguía ordenes? ¿De quién?-. Jayson pregunto. Tomas miro por el espejo al padre sonrió y dijo. - Nosotros pagamos con nuestros servicios y si es necesario hasta con nuestra vida la generosa ayuda que nos han dado Jack y Denis. Los pasajeros miraron al conductor aún más sorprendidos por lealtad que les tenían a sus benefactores. En las afueras de la ciudad Dorian se encuentra sentado frente a una mesa en una habitación en las afueras de Broocklyn curando sus heridas con una botella de alcohol, el dolor que le provocaba lo hacía reír pero en el fondo parecía que reía al recordar cómo había matado aquel hombre en el edificio Cuentinton estaba concentrado recordando el rostro lleno de terror de Anthony segundos antes de que lo matara en ese momento vino a su mente el rostro del joven que vio salir del departamento de Nancy. Recordaba que cuando se fue del edificio Cuentinton se dirigió a donde se encontraba Arakami quien enseguida identifico al hombre que había matado Dorian y al joven que salió del departamento ambos hace algunos años fueron socios y amigos. Dorian tenía un nuevo plan si existía una conexión entre el joven que salió del departamento y Nancy tal vez el primero si le diría donde están las piedras. Él quería las piedras a como diera lugar aun si tenía que arriesgar su vida. En la empresa Dallas Corp., Koben Dallas permanecía atento a cualquier movimiento que pudieran hacer los hermanos Dallas hasta que su celular sonó. - Capitán Korben Dallas el padre Jayson necesita verlo urgentemente se trata de las jovencitas que viven en el edificio Cuentiton -. Se escuchó decir a la voz que salía por auricular del celular. - Entendido -. Korben colgó su celular y rápidamente se dirigió a la iglesia de Brooklyn. Los hermanos Dallas y Tomas llegaron a la Iglesia de Brooklyn y entraron por la parte trasera. - El capitán no tarda en llegar será mejor que te vayas Tomas, gracias por todo-. Se despedía Jayson mientras le daba un apretón de manos y se quedaba parado junto a la puerta. El aludido se despidió amablemente de los hermanos, se dirigió al estacionamiento para subir a su taxi e irse. En la entrada de la iglesia se encontraba ya el capitán Korben, entro y con la mirada comenzó a buscar al padre hasta que encontró al sacristán. - Buenos días ¿Dónde puedo encontrar al padre Jayson? -. Pregunto enseguida el capitán al encontrarse frente al sacristán. - Salió hace un par de horas no sé a qué hora regrese -. Decía el joven aludido y miraba sereno al hombre que tenía frente a él. - Si usted desea puede dejarle un recado Korben miro pensativo al sacristán. - Lo espero… fue a sentar a una butaca a esperar. Después de unos minutos el padre llego entrando por la sacristía encontrando sentado en primera fila al capitán. - Capitán Dallas, me alegro mucho verlo…- Saludo Jayson al hombre estrechando su mano. – Qué bueno que fue usted el que ha venido. El aludido se levantó de la butaca quedando frente al padre. - Padre Jayson me dijeron que tiene información sobre el paradero de las jovencitas del edificio Cuentinton. El padre camino hacia donde estaba el sacrista y coloco su mano sobre el hombro del joven. - Eliot necesito que me cubras unos minutos mientras platico con el capitán Dallas. El joven aludido asintió con la cabeza mientras seguía barriendo. El padre le dio indicaciones al capitán para que lo siguiera. Adentro en la sacristía se encontraban las hermanas Dallas en silencio cuando entro el capitán y el padre se levantaron de las sillas donde se encontraban sentadas, enseguida el capitán saco su celular pero antes de que pudiera llamar a alguien el padre lo detuvo. - Espere señor Korben no lo haga, antes que comenta un error escuche lo que tienen que decirle. El hombre guardo su celular y miro fijamente a las dos chicas. Nancy miro directamente a los ojos a decir. - Un monje apareció en nuestro departamento intento matarme pero apareció un hombre que nos ayudó a escapar. - Vinimos a este lugar porque pensamos que aquí no podía buscar o seguir -. Continuó hablando Lucy mientras tomaba la mano de su amada. Enseguida ella la miro complacida regalándole una fugaz pero dulce mirada para regresar a mirar con serenidad al capitán. - El muy maldito derribó la puerta después de que no lo deje pasar -. Ahora intervino Nancy. - No sé qué busca de nosotras o porque apareció ese otro hombre -. Esta vez Lucy no dejaba de ver capitán fijamente, trataba de no titubear para que no se diera cuanta de la mentira. – Nosotras solo escapamos Korben veía a las dos chicas analizando cada gesto, la forma y el tono en que le decían las cosas era experto en detectar mentiras así que si ellas le mentían él lo sabría o al menos eso creía él. - El monje traía un objeto para electrocutar eso fue lo que me lastimo -. Nancy se percató de la actitud del capitán así que hablaba lo más convincente posible. - Cuando escapamos escuchamos disparos y luego llegamos hasta aquí -. Termino de decir Lucy sin quitar la mirada y esperando las reacciones del capitán. Cuando el capitán termino de escuchar lo que las jóvenes le decían sin despegar la mirada de ellas estuvo en silencio, vio a los ojos azules de Nancy notando en ella tranquilidad, después miro a los ojos verdegrises de Lucy sintiendo en ella algo familiar algo que le causaba nostalgia, tranquilidad y algo extraño. - Capitán Dallas, le ruego que sea discreto si ese hombre nos encuentra…-. Lucy soltó la mano de Nancy mientras hacia una pausa y dio un paso hacia donde se encontraba el aludido. - … intentara de nuevo matarnos -. Termino de decir mirando a Korben con tristeza tratando de conmoverlo para que fuera indulgente con ellas. La mirada de Lucy confundió al capitán Dallas que desvió su mirada y se dio la vuelta viendo al padre. - En una hora regresare para llevármelas en custodia -. Hablaba el capitán regresando a su estado de serenidad. – Yo me encargare de que nadie sepa dónde están. Termino de decir para dirigirse a la salida de la sacristía para después retirarse del edificio. En la empresa Dallas Corp. Jack y Denis entraban a su oficina al cerrar la puerta Denis camino hacia el escritorio cuando paso a un lado de Jack este la tomo de la mano haciéndola voltear hacia donde estaba, él la jalo delicadamente hacia su cuerpo para poderla besar apasionadamente, ella dirigió sus manos hacia la corbata de su joven amante deshaciendo el nudo mientras permanecía con los ojos cerrados siguiendo con el beso que se tornó más vertiginoso. Jack en tanto dirigió sus manos hacia la cintura de su amada deslizándolas lentamente por su cuerpo tratando de grabarse cada detalle hasta llegar a sus glúteos los cuales apretó y acaricio sugestivamente; ella se erizó al sentir las caricias de su amante y suspiro profundamente en el oído de Jack para después comenzar a besarle el cuello, él comenzó a caminar hacia enfrente bajando el cierre del vestido de Denis cuando llegaron al escritorio ella se sentó en el escritorio dejando a su amado hombre entre sus muslos, se miraron fijamente a los ojos tomando un poco de aire para continuar con su sensual acto, ella comenzó a besarlo de vez en cuando mordía el labio inferir de él haciendo que el sonriera ampliamente complacido, él deslizaba los tirantes del vestido para ahora dirigir sus labios al cuello de ella para recorrerlo con suaves besos. Denis en tanto sacaba la camisa del pantalón de Jack para después filtrarse dentro para acariciar seductoramente el cuerpo de su compañero, él al haber bajado los tirantes del vestido dejó al descubierto los voluptuosos pechos de ella cubiertos aun por su sostén y dirigió sus labios hacia ellos para besarlos y acariciarlos hasta donde se lo permitía aquella prenda, aquel acto acelero la respiración y deseo de ella que se apuró a terminar de desabrochar el pantalón mientras permanecía con los ojos cerrados y suspirando sin más dirigió una de sus manos dentro del pantalón desabrochado para acariciar la virilidad del joven que al contacto comenzó a excitarse más y más solo pudo levantar su rostro al cielo disfrutando de las caricias que le proporcionaba Denis que ahora besaba muy sensualmente el cuello de él. Por un instante se sintió perdido, gozoso de cada caricia que sentía entre sus piernas, sus labios solo podían mostrar una enorme sonrisa de satisfacción. Con los ojos cerrados permanecía seducido por los besos y caricias de Denis en aquel estado de satisfacción total una imagen vino a su mente incomodándolo un poco pero al sentir que ella aumentaba el ritmo de las caricias se dejó llevar por cada caricia, cada beso parecía estar en la misma gloria sin duda ella sabía cómo complacerlo casi hasta hacerlo enloquecer. Su excitación iba en aumento, su respiración era agitada y en ocasiones se entrecortaba, aquella imagen regreso una vez más invadiéndolo completo podía ver aquella imagen con tanta claridad que sintió que esta era real aquella persona que veía en la imagen estaba frente a él acariciándolo, besándolo y llevándolo al límite, él solo pudo responder aquellos besos con gran pasión como si fuera la primera vez, como si la vida se terminara hoy, un beso que conducía al mismo paraíso lentamente se separaron él quería mirarla a los ojos para recuperar el aliento un instante y comenzar con lo que su cuerpo le dictaba, al abrir los ojos vio a Denis frente a él por un momento se confundió mirándola extrañado, ella intento besarlo pero él solo coloco su cachete, se separó de ella, se abrocho los pantalones y miro a su hermana sin entender lo que había pasado. Ella se levantó los tirantes acomodándose el vestido e intrigada pregunto. - ¿Qué ocurre te siente bien? Jack miro hacia el suelo, luego a ella para sin más darse la vuelta y caminar hacia la salida. - Jack -. Denis llamo a su compañero lo veía raro y no sabía porque lo cual le molestaba mucho que podía estar tramando u ocultándole. El aludido se dio la vuelta mirando a Denis aun sentada en el escritorio esbozo una sonrisa forzada. - Nada… -. Cuando vio a Denis molesta busco otra forma de excusarse. – Bueno me siento un poco…mmmmm…con…dolor de cabeza -. Fue lo que se ocurrió trataba de ser convincente pero tenía la cabeza en otro lado. –Voy a ver a Jayson para saber cómo va todo. - ¿Quieres que valla contigo? -. Pregunto la joven levantándose rápidamente del escritorio. - Si…no…digo si…bueno no…-. Jack empezó a ser un lio no sabía que quería y mucho menos que le estaba pasando. –… quiero estar solo -. Fue lo último que dijo y se fue del lugar. En la iglesia ingresaron 4 policías bien armados seguidos por el capitán Dallas que al encontrar a las hermanas se las llevó a su departamento donde vivía con su primera esposa la misma que se había ido con su abogado, en ese lugar día y noche esos cuatro hombres custodiarían a las hermanas. Jack llego a un bar a las fueras de la ciudad estaba en la barra tomando tratando de resolver sus confusiones que se veían más complicadas conforme se alcoholizaba a lo lejos Dorian lo miraba complacido sabía que era el lugar y momento apropiado para sacarle el paradero de las cuatro piedras y sobre todo del quinto elemento. Si no cooperaba no había nadie que lo ayudara para que impidiera que Dorian torturara hasta la muerte al joven Dallas, así que se acercó a él sentándose a un lado. - Cantinero, un trago para mí y mi amigo Jack un poco mareado lo volteo a ver, cuando vio la vestimenta del monje se sorprendió. - ¿Amigo?, ¿Monje?, ¿En una cantina? Dorian se rio al percatarse del estado en el que estaba su próxima víctima y tratando de ser amable dijo. - Hermano mío las penas con alcohol no son buenas porque no vienes y yo te enseñare el verdadero camino - ¡¿Qué?!... primero me invitas un trago después a ir contigo… lo siento pero no eres mi tipo - No me entiendes verdad…-. Dorian se acercó más a Jack. – Yo mate a Anthony era un verdadero pedazo de carne podrida. Jack sintió como toda su cólera se elevaba. - Eres… El joven se levantó de su lugar y enojado alzó el puño pero antes de poder hacer algo Dorian ya había tirado el primer golpe tirándolo sobre una mesa. Enseguida la seguridad del bar llego sacándolos violentamente del lugar ya afuera Jack se levantó del suelo se lanzó para golpear a Dorian que lo recibe con su bastón eléctrico haciendo caer al joven una vez más, ya en suelo Dorian lo pateo y electrocuto mientras le decía. - Anda grita quiero escuchar tus lamentos pidiéndome piedad porque me detenga igual que tu estúpido amigo -. Dorian reían extasiado con los quejidos del chico. - Basta te daré lo que quieres -. Apenas pudo pronunciar Jack. Tras aquellas palabras el monje se detuvo sorprendido, su víctima tomo aire enderezándose un poco. - Se lo que fuiste a buscar anoche…yo me las lleve Dorian miro intrigado al joven no recordaba que el llevara algo cuando salió del apartamento de las chicas. - ¿Dónde están las piedras? -. Pregunto el monje encendiendo una vez más su arma favorita. Jack se quedó callado tratando de improvisar un poco para engañarlo y poder escapar, pero el albino no soporto la espera y volvió a electrocutarlo. - Las piedras están… -. Comenzó a decir el chico con mucho trabajo. Dorian al percatarse que su víctima no podía articular bien las palabras por el dolor se detuvo. - Las piedras están… - Yo las tengo porque no vienes por ellas Se escuchó detrás de Dorian que voltio rápidamente hacia dónde provenía aquella voz. Nota Final: Gracias por leer y si deseas comentar adelante no tengas pena para expresar tu opinión.[Chapter 11] Indeseable destino Nota inicial: Hola de nuevo aquí les traigo otro emocionante capítulo de esta entretenida historia, espero que sea de su agrado. El lugar, el callejón trasero de un bar en las afueras de la ciudad, la situación, complicada para Jack ya que se encuentra al filo del callejón a punto de caer al vacío y el criminal, un albino despiadado que se regocija al saber que lo que quiere pronto será suyo. - ¿Dónde están las piedras? -. Pregunto el monje encendiendo una vez más su arma favorita. Jack se quedó callado tratando de improvisar un poco para engañarlo y poder escapar, pero el albino no soporto la espera y volvió a electrocutarlo. - Las piedras están… -. Comenzó a decir el chico con mucho trabajo. Dorian al percatarse que su víctima no podía articular bien las palabras por el dolor se detuvo. - Las piedras están… - Yo las tengo porque no vienes por ellas Se escuchó detrás de Dorian que voltio rápidamente hacia dónde provenía aquella voz, a unos cuantos metros de él vio parada a Denis viéndolo desafiantemente. - Una mujer…-. El monje comenzó a reír complacido con lo que estaba pasando, mofándose de que una mujer lo veían de esa forma. – Te escucho… ¿las piedras? - Ven con nosotros y te llevaremos con las piedras -. Denis decía mientras se acercaba a Jack para levantarlo del suelo - Como sé que no es una trampa -. El monje desconfiaba de las palabras de los dos por alguna razón. - Es lo que buscas, no es así, si no las quieres o no nos crees, tú te lo pierdes-. Intervino una vez más Denis mirando fijamente al agresor. - O puedo matarlos en este preciso instante y después buscar a sus amigas para obligarlas a decirme en donde están las piedras. Jack se recargo en los hombros de Denis que miraba una vez más retante a Dorian, este la miraba con odio tratando de contenerse y no matarlos. Ella con el dedo índice le señalo hacia una dirección. - Mi carro esta por haya, te prometo que te llevaremos donde están las piedras y tú nos prometerás algo... - ¿Qué es lo que quieres? - Debes prometernos que no nos harás daño a mí, a mi hermano y a mis amigas, entendido - Como sé que es lo que busco - Cuatro piedras que simbolizan los elementos de la naturaleza: aire, agua, fuego y tierra -. Esta vez intervino Jack levantando su rostro un poco para mirar al monje Dorian miro contento a los hermanos y feliz del dijo. - Se los prometo después de esto jamás sabrán de mí. Tras conducir por una hora Denis dirigió su carro hacia la neblina de las antiguas ciudades lo cual provoco que Dorian de exaltara un poco. - Tranquilo \"amigo\" crees que tendríamos las piedras en la superficie -. Jack dijo al mirar la expresión de aquel hombre que iba sentado junto a él en la parte trasera del auto. Después de media hora Denis se detuvo enfrente de una gran pila de basura alrededor de ellos algunos edificios que servían de base para las nuevas ciudades y una niebla densa que muy poco dejaba ver. - Aquí es, nos esperas en el carro o vas con nosotros -. Denis miro al monje por el retrovisor Dorian se sentía muy emocionado por lo que estaba pasando y acento con la cabeza. El primero en bajar fue Jack que espero que el monje hiciera lo mismo, cuando el albino abrió la puerta y coloco un pie fuera del automóvil fue recibió un tremendo golpe en la espalda proveniente del joven Dallas que se columpio en la entrada del carro para tomar mayor fuerza. Dorian cayó al suelo adolorido por el golpe, enseguida Denis encendió el vehículo y su hermano cerro las puertas. Afuera el monje se levanta enfurecido tanto que enloquecido se levantó y antes que arrancara el carro golpeo el vidrio donde iba Jack el impacto rompió el cristal y los nudillos del albino, pero no pudo evitar que el automóvil diera marcha en reversa a toda velocidad en un rápido movimiento logro subirse al cofre del carro que siguió en movimiento, adentro Denis veía fijamente a los ojos de Dorian con tanta furia por lo que le había hecho a Anthony y sus hermanas. Dorian se colocó de cuclillas sosteniéndose con una mano de los limpiadores mientras levanto la otra llena de sangre cerrándola listo para arremeter contra el vidrio, sin más lanzó su puño con todas sus fuerzas, pero bruscamente se detuvo el carro lo que hizo que se desprendiera el limpiador, rápidamente el auto acelero lo que provoco que el monje callera al suelo, en un segundo movimiento el vehículo se fue de reversa a toda velocidad y la conductora solo levanto su mano diciéndole adiós con una sonrisa burlona para después dirigirse a la superficie. El albino miro a su alrededor estaba solo, los recuerdos de su desventurada infancia lo llenaron de cólera golpeo al suelo manchando la tierra con su sangre, estaba ahí en medio de la nada sin nadie que lo ayudara. Horas más tarde llegaron a la mansión Dallas Denis y Jack donde ya los esperaba Jayson en la sala, cuando llegaron junto a él los miro aliviado. - Milagro… creí que nunca llegarían -. Jayson miro sucio a su hermano y no pudo evitar decir. – Mírate Jack deberías irte a bañar a ver si así se te limpian los pecados... o tal vez es por eso que no te bañas, porque eres un sucio pecador. El aludido camino enojado hacia Jayson pero se detuvo al sentir como Denis lo tomaba por la mano. - Jack…-. Denis vio al padre y después continuo.- así que las cosas no resultaron como las planeamos. - Así es, el capitán Korben se llevó a Lucy y Nancy bajo custodia. Lo poco que se es que el monje legalmente no existe, no se sabe de dónde vino, donde vive o que hace es como un demonio que aparece y desaparece para hacer el mal. - Basura…-. Dijo Jack dirigiéndose al elevador. – ese monje no fue capaz de hacernos daño a nosotros, menos mal que no lo veremos en un largo tiempo. - Enserio, el tiempo suficiente para evitar que este aquí el día del juicio final -. Entró Jayson al elevador mientras preguntaba - Bueno no tanto yo pienso que en un par de meses o más andaría de nuevo buscándonos -. Decía Denis que ya se encontraba dentro del elevador. - Pero no nos encontrara -. Ahora intervino Jack pulsando el botón que los llevaría a la cocina. - ¿Por qué? -. La interrogante venia del padre Jayson - Es evidente que nos iremos de este planeta Lucy y Nancy vendrán con nosotros -. Contesto el hermano. - … y tú también así que no hay de qué preocuparse -. Añadió Denis - ¿Qué están locos y la tierra? -. Preguntó una vez más el padre que no podía entender porque sus hermanos aun no creían que el día del juicio final se acercaba. - Regresaremos dentro de cinco mil años cuando el día del juicio final llegue -. Esta vez intervino Denis. El elevador se detuvo pero ninguno de los tres salió del elevador. - ¿Qué?... no lo entienden ese día se acerca y no será dentro de cinco mil años será pronto no pueden irse -. Explicaba Jayson tratando de convencer a sus hermanos, los necesitaba si quería detener la destrucción de la tierra. - Tú eres el quinto elemento…-. Señalo Jack al su hermano empezándose a alterar estaba harto de escuchar sobre ese tema. – tu deber es detener el día del juicio final para eso fuiste creado para proteger la vida de este planeta y del universo… nosotros salimos sobrando. - ¿Y los cuatro elementos?-. Hizo una pausa mirando a sus hermanos tenía que existir alguna forma de convencerlos que eran indispensables para esta misión no podía hacerlo solo era evidente pero para sus hermanos era algo que él solo debía de hacer. –Esto es algo que yo y los cuatro elementos debemos hacer proteger la vida del universo…no pueden irse -. Termino de decir preocupado. - Es absurda tu idea de que el fin del mundo se acerca… no tienes pruebas -. Jack se dio la vuelta dándole la espalda a su hermano y cruzándose de brazos. - Te equivocas Jack dentro de tres meses será el equinopsio de primavera y los nueve planetas se alinearan será el comienzo del día final. - Que locura además de padrecito eres astrónomo, en verdad crees que te voy a creer, que porque va a pasar eso el día del juicio final llegara, estás loco -. Jack miro a través del espejo del elevador a su hermano. - Eso fue lo que paso cuando el capitán Korben salvo la tierra y por alguna extraña razón ese fenómeno se repetirá… Jack tienes que creer es verdad lo que te digo -. Dijo determinante Jayson que estaba profundamente preocupado porque no le creían Denis miro la preocupación del padrecito tenía razón también estaba el hecho de que el monje estaba obsesionado por encontrar los cuatro elementos. - Te creo Jayson y por eso nos quedaremos -. Denis se acercó al padrecito colocando su mano en el hombro del religioso para tranquilizarlo. Jack miro aquella escena enojado salió del elevador y se sentó en la mesa furioso porque tal vez las palabras de su hermano también habían logrado convencerlo.

","Summary":" Triste Destino Esta historia comienza después de que la tierra fue salvada de las garras del mal y "},{"Movie":"Forrest Gump","Title":"Alguien que si te amé","Author":"No soy Carol","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12778551","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Sé que esta pareja está muy rebuscada y esta historia creo que ya nadie la recuerda, pero el otro día vi la película por enésima vez y una vez más renegué de que Jenny nunca aprecio ese amor, Forrest merecía que alguien si le hubiera querido como solo él sabía querer, y quien mejor para cumplir ese deber que el Teniente Dan quien de verdad lo necesitaba Ninguno de los personajes me pertenece, basado en la película de Forrest Gump (1994) a su vez basada en la novela homónima del escritor Winston Groom Las cálidas noches en Vietnam eran muy calmadas a pesar del constante estado de alerta de las tropas, para Forrest no había nada como sentarse a un lado del camino y ver las estrellas para una vez más pensar en lo único que de verdad le llegaba a preocupar desde hace años \"¿Qué estará haciendo Jenny? ¿dónde estará?\" esa idea de saber cómo estaría ella era una constante que prácticamente lo guiaba, el soñar con abrazarla una vez más y sentir sus besos suaves como el algodón de azúcar, la amaba como a nada en la vida, un amor tan idealizado y platónico… el mismo sabía que ella no le amaba ni le miraría como a un amante, ella solo le veía como ese amigo de toda la vida, no importaba cuantas veces le ofreciera su corazón ella siempre declinaría a sus propuestas de una vida juntos - Jennny – murmuro solitario y triste - ¿otra vez esa Jenny? – pregunto el Teniente que estaba a su lado El Teniente Dan era un hombre bueno, seguro y decidido, Forrest le miraba siempre lleno de profundo respeto y admiración, ese hombre a pesar de ser unos cuantos años mayor, se veía tan joven como el mismo Forrest, esa mirada perspicaz y fiera que se dibuja en esos pálidos ojos azules eternamente atentos y curiosos, aunque le diera vergüenza admitirlo ni los ojos de Jenny eran así de bonitos, Jenny tenía esa mirada suave y triste pero el Teniente bueno el Teniente era tan determinado y atento que Forrest no hacía más que seguirle como un pollito tras una gallina, obedeciendo cada advertencia cada orden, con un solo gesto el Teniente ya tenía al soldado a su disposición dispuesto a recibir órdenes y cumplirlas a la perfección - Jennny es mi muy mejor amiga, señor – respondió el hombre parándose derecho - ¿la amas? –pregunto curioso Forrest volvió la vista para ver que el Teniente estaba como cosa rara sin camisa, exhibiendo esa ancha espalda y esos fornidos brazos, era tan blanco como un vaso de leche a pesar de lo duro que podía ser el viaje, su piel seguía intacta sin manchas, sin picaduras sin quemaduras, era perfecto, Forrest no sabía sin sentir una vez más admiración o celos ante semejante hombre… el Teniente dan se sentó a su lado mirándole desde abajo solo siguió acomodándose entre la hierba, era suave y húmeda, los bichos cantaban haciendo que los suaves murmullos entre ellos no fueran nada, era imposible despertar al pelotón mientras susurraran - Ella es mmi chica – suspiro algo avergonzado de decir semejante cosa Al final de cuentas todos sus conocidos hablaban así de sus esposas y novias, sus chicas desde que estaba en la universidad sus compañeros del equipo hablaban de sus chicas, de sus amantes y ligues de una noche, siendo gráficos y hasta vulgares, eso le espantaba demasiado, así que él lo tomaba más por un lado más familiar para él, su amiga y el hecho de amarla incondicionalmente - ¿ella te espera? ¿allá en Alabama? – el Teniente estaba aburrido por el modo en que preguntaba, probablemente solo estaba haciéndole charla - No… ella se fue lejos - ¿entonces como sigue siendo tu chica? – estaba intrigado por como enarcaba su ceja - Emmmm ella solo es mmi chica especial – se explicaba lentamente tratando de pensar El Teniente sujeto a Forrest del brazo bajándolo a su nivel entre la hierba, Forrest solo se acomodó obediente como el dulce chico que era, se le quedo viendo en silencio mientras el Teniente solo le analizaba de arriba abajo y con una sonrisita de medio lado le inquirió - ¿eres tonto? ¿acaso crees que ella te esperara? - Ella… ella… - eso le había dolido ¿acaso ella tenía que hacerlo? - ¿si quiera te beso? – pregunto intentando entender el retraso mental del soldado - Si… y me abrazo… - intento recordad bastante patidifuso – Tenniente Dann El Teniente solo negaba con la cabeza impresionado por la ingenuidad de su soldado preferido, era tan buen muchacho que simplemente le ofendía que esa tal \"Jenny\" no le hablara claro, si no le quería que lo mandara a freír espárragos de una buena vez, solo no podía entender cómo era posible escribirle y suspirar por ella sin siquiera una respuesta o alguna esperanza esperándole en casa, se sintió identificado en eso… no tenía a nadie esperándole en casa, estaba mejor en esa jungla infestada de charlies que en New York - Forrest, tú te mereces a alguien que si te aprecie – sentencio finalmente - Ella mme a precia – respondió sumamente ofendido - No, alguien que te \"quiera\" alguien que esté dispuesto a amarte – intento explicarse Un silencio sumamente incómodo y tenso inundo la noche ni los grillos o las chicharras podían hacer más ameno el ambiente, Forrest estaba perdido en la seria mirada del Teniente, ese aire de preocupación era nuevo, era íntimo y acogedor, se sentía más seguro al lado del Teniente de lo que había estado en mucho tiempo, si debía combatir toda esta guerra rogaba a Dios que siempre pudiera estar al lado del su Teniente, no por nada siempre se ofrecía a hacer la guardia junto a él, era la más pesada al estar revisando todo y rondando \"por si acaso\" nadie más estaba dispuesto a pasar casi media noche en esas junto al superior juzgándoles por su ineptitud - ¿Cómmo quién? – pregunto una vez más profundamente perdido - Debes buscar a alguien a quien amar y que te amé de igual manera – sugirió encogiéndose de hombros – tu tienes que buscarla… eso ya es problema tuyo - ¿P-por qué no Jennny? – pregunto con la mirada mucho más sombría de lo normal - Si tengo entendido, Jenny no te ama… te quiere como un hermano no como un novio Era verdad Forrest hablaba de Jenny día y noche, incluso los demás soldados bromeaban al respecto, pero solo con Bubba y el Teniente tenían suficiente confianza como para mencionar esos detalles tan personales llenos de sus inseguridades y realidades muy complicadas para su gusto, era mejor el día a día ocupándose en lo que fuera antes de volver a suspirar por los eternos risos dorados de Jenny, esas suaves manos cálidas y esa voz tan dulce y amorosa como de un ángel - ¿Cómo es el amor de un novio? – estaba intrigado, él nunca había tenido novia El Teniente se quedó perplejo, era la respuesta más difícil de decir, no sabía cómo explicar el amor que se le tiene a una amante, mucho menos a alguien tan sencillo y suave como Forrest - Un novio se preocupa, se… se… siente feliz y hace feliz a su novia, tu sabes hacen… cosas Estaba siente indo que él era el tonto a estas alturas, no sabía ni como decirlo, estaba muy apenado de su ineptitud como mentor, el mismo había fracasado como novio y amante desde hace años, la milicia le había consumido su vida social y sentimental, el solo vivía por su honor, su destino y por supuesto su patria… o eso creía hasta que recibió a esos nuevos soldados, cuando Forrest se presentó y le juro que haría hasta lo imposible para no fallarle se sintió alagado, se sintió con una enorme responsabilidad para con ese soldado, no debía fallarle, debía protegerle de todo mal y peligro, ese apego cada día mas fuerte hacia ese tonto que solo sabía asentir con una suave sonrisita le estaba comenzando a cobrar factura… estaba comenzando a sentir esa necesidad de estar a su lado y guiarle, de cuidarle, abrigarle - Gump no es por nada… pero tú ya la amas como un novio ama Esa conclusión confundió al pobre soldado, si él Amaba así ¿Por qué estaba mal? - ¿ella me ammara así? – pregunto al aire completamente ensimismado Apretando los puños, solo tomo aire intentando calmarse, estaba asustado y triste de pensar en semejantes cosas, Jenny no era así... ella era dulce con él... ella algún día sabría amarlo como él la amaba a ella en cuerpo y alma, hasta el final - Ni idea – respondió el Teniente con una actitud más reservada - Tenniente Dann – pregunto con la voz algo quebrada - Dime… - asintió preocupado por ese gesto Forrest de repente estaba con los ojos llorosos, las mejillas y la nariz rojas y temblando como un niño que trata en vano de calmar el llanto, gimoteando por lo bajo solo pudo sollozar entre susurros tristes y desolados que por poco le desgarran el alma a Dan Taylor - ¿alguien po-podria amarmme así? – concluyo destrozado Si el Teniente dudaba hasta del eterno amor de Jenny solo significaba una cosa. Forrest no era digno de ser amado ante los ojos de nadie, era un retardado como todos le gritaban, era un bobo que no merecía ser amado, nadie le amaría y solo merecía la lastima de otros, estaba destrozado con pensar en algo tan triste, ¿Qué hizo mal? ¿había algo malo con él? Estaba sumamente triste a estas alturas rompiendo en un llanto silente y amargo, empapándose en sus propias lagrimas - Claro que te amaran así – aseguro el superior con un brillo especial en su mirada - ¿Lo… lo cree? – gimoteo con un hipo bastante tierno e infantil - Si – asintió solemnemente – que me parta un rayo si nadie te llega apreciar Forrest sintió de nuevo arder la esperanza en su pecho y con una débil sonrisa en la comisura de los labios se arrimó al Teniente para darle un tierno abrazo, Forrest era de los que no le ven nada de malo a un abrazo o a demostrar afecto a los demás, su madre le había enseñado así - Forrest – susurro el Teniente algo incomodo - ¿Si? - Quítate. Habían pasado unos días y Forrest estaba aún más incómodo ante la presencia del Teniente, Bubba ahora hacia la guardia con el Teniente, el cual estaba muy en lo suyo protegiendo y guiando a sus hombres, era como el pastor de este rebaño asegurándose de la supervivencia de hasta el último de ellos, era tan noble y valeroso, quería seguirle hasta el fin del mundo, quería demostrarle su aprecio, su cariño, su amor… era difícil de explicar cómo el apego que siente por Jenny era tan distinto y similar al que sentía por el Teniente, el Teniente era algo menos idealizado y perfecto ante sus ojos, era más una cuestión humana, una cosa terrenal, como si algo en su pecho se sintiera cálido y suave a su lado, no tuviera miedo, dolor o cansancio alguno, como un bálsamo que le aliviaba y le hacía fuerte. Jenny era otra historia ella se sentía como una enorme felicidad, como una calma indescriptible, como cuando se va a la feria todo consiste en la expectativa y la diversión que significa el riesgo de las atracciones, las golosinas y la buena compañía, el Teniente Dan era como beber una Dr Pepper bien fría durante el mediodía en el cálido verano de Greenbow, algo que más que imaginárselo y luego vivir el sueño para sentirse vacío después, se sentía tan propio y llenador, como que quieres otro sorbo y beber hasta quedar sin aliento - Gump hoy te toca guardia – ordeno a lo lejos con su cigarrillo en los labios - Si señor – respondió obediente como siempre Agachando la cabeza amarro sus zapatos y marcho para hacer la guardia, esperando una vez más a Bubba para su turno, pero valla sorpresa cuando el Teniente llego para plantarse a su lado con un aire desafiante, Forrest sol respingo un poco tratando de contener la alegría de ver al Teniente, estaban cubiertos de tierra y hojas, habían caminado muchísimo entre la espesa jungla, no habían caminos y esta noche las estrellas no se podrían ver por las altas copas de los árboles, el Teniente estaba armado hasta los dientes ya que no estaban seguros si habrían animales peligrosos en la zona, Forrest paso saliva y siguió en lo suyo vigilando el campamento a lo lejos - ¿Cómo estás? – pregunto el Teniente con voz suave y cansada - Bien – asintió el soldado con una suave sonrisita - Bien… estas hecho mierda, muchacho – le regaño al ver lo pálido que estaba - Estoy bien-n Tenniente Dan - afirmo algo nervioso por esa nueva actitud El Teniente solo asintió viéndole fijamente, estaba muy pálido y nervioso ¿estaría enfermo? O acaso desobedeció sus indicaciones de seguridad y tenía los pies destrozados eso le hizo sentir un enorme vacío en la boca del estómago como si la culpa recayera en sus hombros, si el no podía cuidar se sus hombres ¿Quién más lo haría? Como su superior insistió mucho más serio - Gump ¿Qué tienes? ¿te hirieron o algo? - No señor – respondió cabizbajo - ¿Te volvieron a tratar de tonto? – pregunto algo enojado No había nada que hiciera enojar más en el mundo al Teniente Dan que el hecho de que trataran a Gump de tonto o idiota, simplemente no lo toleraba - No – Forrest se veía muy incómodo – señor - ¿Qué te duele? ¿estas enfermo? – el superior estaba frunciendo el ceño en un gesto grave - Señor… ¿Cuándo volveremmos a casa? Esa pregunta le dejo helado ¿ellos podrían si quiera volver a casa? No lo sabía y debía ser sincero ante el hecho que en cualquier momento caerían o serian atacados - Es una guerra Forrest, no hay mucho que hacer - ¿solo nno dejarse mmatar? – pregunto mucho más serio - Exacto… si le pasa algo a alguno de ustedes seria mi culpa – se explicaba encogido de hombros – si algo te pasara Gump no me lo perdonaría… Forrest se le quedo viendo fijamente con los labios entreabiertos, y un silencio sumamente profundo, no era un ambiente incómodo, al contrario, era un silencio acogedor y cálido - Ojalá pudiera acabar la guerra – continuo el Teniente – ojalá pudieras volver a casa - No immporta si no acaba la guerra – concluyo el hombre más joven ensimismado - ¿Por qué? – respondió confundido - Porque, por lo menos puedo estar junto al Teniente – concluyo con una dulce sonrisa Dan se sintió diminuto y frágil ante semejante conclusión, Forrest siempre le decía que su madre hablaba de una caja de chocolates, pues para Dan Taylor Forrest era esa caja de chocolates, nunca sabia con qué le iba a salir ahora, se sintió tan pequeño en esa inmensa y oscura selva viendo fijamente a esos ojos que no era ni azules ni verdes, esa mirada tan dulce y suave le lleno de una calidez que no recordaba en años, no había sentido tanto cariño en un millón de años, se sentía profundamente en deuda con ese soldado pasara lo que pasara debería cuidarlo cual tesoro - No seas tonto, la guerra es mala… - Mammá dice que tonto es el que hace tonterías – respondió - Pues querer estar conmigo en la guerra es una tontería – explicaba el mayor - ¿es mmalo querer estar con usted? – pregunto arrugando ligeramente la frente - Si… yo estoy aquí porque es mi destino y tengo tanto por demostrar, tu no entiendes - Mammá dice que la vida es como un… - Si ya se ya se… como una caja de chocolates… no sabes que te va a tocar Se siguieron mirando en silencio, allí de pie sin decirse o hacer nada, pudieron pasar dos minutos o mil años, pero se sintió como si el mundo solo se hubiera detenido en ese instante, sus miradas estaban fijas en el otro, una suave sonrisa se dibujó en la comisura de los labios del Teniente, ya no se sentía en una enorme selva en el fin del mundo, Forrest se sonrojó ligeramente al verle sonreír y bajando la mirada tímidamente al suelo - Forrest – le llamó suavemente tomándole del hombro - Si señor – respondió el soldado sin mirarle a la cara Dan solo tomo aire y antes de darle tiempo a cualquier duda o reacción le planto un beso en la mejilla justo donde iniciaban los labios del joven, esperando una reacción violenta se alejó un poco, pero solo encontró con que el muchacho estaba rojo como un tomate, temblando como un plato de gelatina, prendado de tanta dulce inocencia e ingenuidad que no eran dignas de este mundo y menos de esta guerra tan larga y cruenta, dan solo suspiro enarcando la ceja - Tenniente Dann – dijo finalmente con apenas un hilito de voz - Dime – respondió en apenas un susurro Y contra todo pronóstico volvió la vista fija a su Teniente, el hombre mayor apenas si titubeo un segundo antes de que el joven soldado le devolviera el beso, un casto beso en los labios, sin caricias o abrazos como lo hacen las personas normalmente, solo poso firmemente sus labios sobre los suyos, se sentían cálidos, no eran suaves como los besos de Jenny, sus labios se sentían secos y rotos, su aliento era cálido, Forrest había cerrado los ojos con tal fuerza que veía chispitas como cuando los aprietan con las manos, tenía tanta pena de hacer esto pero algo en su interior le pedía a gritos hacerlo, no podría vivir o morir un día más en Vietnam hasta besar a ese amable y valeroso hombre, en su momento no le pareció malo o sucio, ¿acaso no besas a alguien cuando lo amas? Recordó cuando una vez hacia un par de años atrás pilló por error a dos de sus compañeros del equipo de football besándose bajo las gradas, no eran besos tiernos o ligeros como cuando veía a su vecina darle besos de despedida a su novio, eran besos muy profundos y bruscos, como si se pelearan y a la vez se dieran cariño, intrigado solo vio en silencio por un corto instante para luego irse, no dijo nada porque él tenía más vergüenza por fijarse en esas cosas que por meterse en la vida de otros, no le parecía educado o cortes decirles algo después en los entrenamientos. El Teniente no retrocedió en cambio devolvió nuevamente el beso, otro beso igual de casto y gentil, tomo suavemente su mano, no como para agarrarla solo posando ligeramente su mano sobre la del soldado, el más joven dejo de temblar, y entreabriendo un poco los labios indico que estaba listo para un beso más apasionado, Dan comenzó a besarle con más fuerza, moviendo sus labios mientras el soldado seguía el compás con torpeza y pudor, Forrest le tomo la otra mano y entrelazando los dedos le sujeto gentilmente para acercarlo mas, los besos iban y venían los suspiros silenciosos y exhalaciones ahogadas ni se sentían entre el ruido suave y a su vez ensordecedor de la jungla - Tenniente Dann – suspiro finalmente ya sin aire en sus pulmones Separándose un poco se miraron en silencio, acalorados y temblorosos tenían tanta adrenalina corriendo por sus sistemas más que en cualquier batalla, Forrest se sujetó con fuerza de la mano del capitán que solo le miraba sonrojado y nervioso, temía por que les pillaran prefería morir con el enemigo que ser descubierto por alguno de sus soldados. Había pasado un rato estaban en un cómodo y cariñoso silencio entre miradas tiernas y uno que otro besito fugaz en cualquier lado de la cara, las manos sudorosas de Forrest se negaban a soltar el tembloroso agarre del Teniente - Forrest – llamo su atención finalmente Forrest asintió mientras sonreía, estaba tan dichoso que no cabía en sí, era como vivir el sueño, su mayor sueño sentir el calor del Teniente, su cariño y admiración eran tan grandes que no hacía más que pensar en él, siempre que veía el cielo estrellado pensaba en Jenny y le extrañaba en silencio, pero la oscuridad, el camino, las explosiones incluso la sola amenaza de morir en alguna trampa le recordaba que él estaría allí para protegerle, Forrest quería sentir ese abrigo por siempre, no le gustaba que le cuidaran o le trataran como un inútil pero cuando el Teniente le guiaba hasta el mismo se hacia el Tonto - ¿podrías guardar el secreto? – pregunto el mayor trayéndole a la realidad - ¿Cuál Secreto? – susurro confundido - Este secreto – explico en murmullos – este es nuestro secreto - ¿nuestro secreto? – frunció el ceño sintiéndose caer en picada de la nube - Esto es el ejército ¿recuerdas? Esto no puede salirse de la jungla – anuncio cabizbajo - Okay – asintió resignado ¿acaso se avergonzaba de él? - Bien – suspiro plantándole un beso en la frente como a un niño pequeño – te quiero - Yo tammbién lo quiero Teniente Dan Volviendo a abrazar al soldado esta vez el fuego se había apagado, la cruda realidad era otra y no importaba el ensueño de un fugaz instante en medio de la espesa selva, estaban de guardia y faltaba bastante para que esa guerra acabara y mucho más para poder si quiera ser algo más que un Teniente y su subordinado y quien sabe cuánto más para que pudieran tomarse de la mano en público y en plena luz del día, probablemente eso nunca pasara pero para Dan Taylor ese instante en medio de la noche sería probablemente su único buen recuerdo del infierno que fue Vietnam[Chapter 2] Una vez más estaban caminando en medio de los caminos enlodados e inundados, el monzón había aparecido y no había un solo instante en que no estuviera lloviendo, si creían que el Mekong les llegaba a la cintura era porque no habían visto lo que era tener que cargar las armas en el aire mientras el agua les llegaba al cuello nunca antes mejor dicho, Bubba hablaba de pescar camarones (una vez más) y Forrest le seguía la idea de montar un negocio con un barco camaronero (una vez mas) el Teniente pues estaba por ahí renegando entre dientes mientras el último de sus cigarrillos desaparecía entre algún charco tan profundo como una laguna - ¡Gump! – llamo de muy malas pulgas - Si señor – respondió el soldado poniéndose firme como pudo entre el lodo - Es tu turno de hacer guardia – ordeno marchando furibundo – lleva un arma - ¿Un arma? – pregunto algo intrigado - Esos Charlies están cerca – anuncio con cierto pesimismo Forrest asintió y con una ametralladora en las manos marcho como pudo tras el Teniente, esperaba alguna otra indicación, pero solo encontró que el Teniente le guiaba silente y misterioso, con el ceño fruncido y murmurando entre dientes, Dan Taylor solo pateaba todo lo que se le atravesaba en el camino, ¿de dónde salía tanta maleza? Estaba harto, simple y llanamente ya se le había acabado la paciencia, habían pasado meses y no paraba de llover pero esa noche era distinta, solo en algunos instantes la lluvia menguaba, aunque sea un poco lo suficiente para ver el sol brillar tras las nubes grises o ver una pisca de la luna asomarse, esta noche seria así las suaves y heladas gotitas que chispeaban haciéndole imposible abrir bien los ojos, todo estaba inundado y no había un solo rincón donde no chispeara el agua o escurriera como en una ducha - Tenniente ¿a donnde vamos? – pregunto suavemente - Shhhhh – le mando callar caminaron unos diez minutos, Forrest sabía que estaba alejándose demasiado del campamento y de las tropas, echando un leve vistazo atrás noto que ya no se veían las tenues sombras de los soldados, ya no podía encontrar a Bubba que estaría recostando la cabeza en el barro, él siempre le decía que se apoyaran de espaldas el uno contra el otro, así no tendrían que dormir en el suelo, quería muchísimo a Bubba como a un hermano mayor y los hermanos se cuidan mutuamente, viendo nuevamente al Teniente solo recordó por un instante que no le había escrito nada a Jenny en días, se sintió muy mal por eso, aunque le dolía mas admitir que últimamente ni se acordaba de ella, estaban tan ocupados con esta guerra, él estaba tan distraído con el Teniente que simplemente se olvidaba del mundo entero por completo, sintió como la cara le ardía no por el cansancio o el frio del clima, sentía que era vergüenza, cuando estaban solos las rodillas se le doblaban y el corazón se le desbocaba como si le palpitara en los oídos, sus manos temblorosas apretaron el arma para que no se le cayera en el oscuro lodo que ya le llegaba a las rodillas - Mira muchacho – anuncio finalmente El Teniente había encontrado una nueva ruta, la usarían mañana, pero conociendo al Teniente lo más probable es que se la pasarían revisando cada piedra y arbusto que le dieran mala espina (todo le Daba mala espina a ese hombre) Forrest avanzo, pero entonces se estrelló con la palma del Teniente que le detuvo de golpe y mirando el cielo señalo - Mira… Subiendo la mirada a donde guiaba su Teniente encontró un enorme cielo estrellado, había pasado tanto de poder ver el cielo y más así de bello que sintió una enorme calidez en su pecho y con una enorme sonrisa solo asintió maravillado - Las estrellas, las extrañaba - suspiro el Teniente algo más calmado - Yo igual – susurro Forrest con un brillo de inocencia en la mirada Se miraron a los ojos y por esa fracción de segundo fue como si la lluvia hubiera desaparecido, el ruido y la brisa eran suaves y les arrullaban junto con la tenue luz del cielo salpicado de constelaciones enteras que no se podrían ver igual en ninguna otra parte o en ninguna otra noche - Forrest, mañana será un largo día, ya encontramos nuestro camino – anuncio triunfante - Si señor – asintió Gump bastante sonrojado Ese momento fue mágico bajo ese pequeño fragmento de cielo rodeado por la oscura selva, Dan extendió su mano para que Forrest la tomara y marchando sin soltarse entrelazaron sus dedos de regreso a la guardia de siempre, estaba oscuro como boca de lobo y Forrest tenía miedo de chocar con algo o caer en alguna trampa (ahora todo le daba mala espina también) apretó la mano del Teniente que solo le hizo un gesto cariñoso con una suave sonrisa dibujada en los labios, Forrest se arrimó más y en casi un abrazo se quedó allí estático ocultando su rostro en el cálido hombro del otro buscando un refugio a la lluvia - ¿Qué pasa soldado? – bromeo en un suave murmullo lleno de ternura - Todo mme da mala espinna – murmuro como un niño asustado - Shhhh es seguro… creo – le animo Posando su mano sobre la cabeza de Gump acaricio los oscuros cabellos, Dan Taylor nunca pararía de sorprenderse de lo impredecible que podía llegar a ser Gump allí acurrucado solo le dedico una dulce mirada como si fuera un cachorro asustado, riendo por lo bajo le dio un besito en la frente como se le había vuelto costumbre cuando estaban solos - Tenniente Dan – susurro mirándole con dulzura - ¿Qué quieres ahora? – inquirió intrigado - ¿Me daría otro beso? - respondió suplicante Antes de que dijera algo más Dan ya le estaba robando el aliento entre besos bruscos y apasionados, casi ahorrándolo mientras lo sujetaba fuertemente del cuello de la camisa, a lo que el más joven ni corto ni perezoso devolvía los besos abrazando el pecho del Teniente, ahogados y temblorosos seguían dándose besos largos y profundos bajo la lluvia que volvía a su estado habitual, no era de esa lluvia ladeada o esa delgada que te pellizca era esa que te golpea con una fuerza inexplicable en cada gota, las gruesas gotas de agua helada les empapaba una vez más en el día, pegados y jadeantes cedían ante la pasión que se encendía en cada roce y cada gemido ahogado entre cada beso, habían olvidado sus impermeables por lo que sus uniformes quedaron escurriendo agua como si se hubieran caído a un rio, pero eso no les detuvo. Dan solo podía sujetar el rostro del otro entre sus manos para no perderle el rastro y Forrest que apenas apretaba los ojos se aferraba a la espalda y hombros de su amante, fue allí cuando lo noto, no era algo ajeno o muy desconocido para el… pero seguía siendo algo tabú, su entre pierna le dolía mientras se inundaba en sensaciones placenteras y cálidas, algo le pedía más pero él no sabía cómo, solo rogo que el teniente no se hubiera dado cuenta de su erección, una mano fue a parar allá para ocultarla y con la otra empujo al teniente alejándole para que no le viera, agachando la cabeza sumamente avergonzado, tenía muy malas experiencias de ello como cuando él y Jenny estaban en el dormitorio de chicas o cuando eran más jóvenes y Jenny aun insistía en dormir junto a él, pero ya no eran tan niños como antes, las cosas se habían tornado raras e incomodas a esas alturas - ¿Qué pasa? – pregunto sorprendido ¿podía sorprenderse tantas veces al día? - Perdón – susurro cabizbajo y terriblemente compungido - ¿Qué? – rio suavemente - ¿Por qué te disculpas? Bajo un poco la mirada y aunque la noche y la casi nula luz que les amparaba básicamente los dejo ciegos él pudo notar por que el soldado se alejaba y sumando uno más uno solo concluyo con un - Oh, es eso… Forrest se alejó cubriéndose agachado, le dolía mucho porque ya no era agradable era humillante - ¿alguna vez estuviste con alguien? - Nno… La primera vez que escucho esa pregunta no la entendió, pero habían pasado años y ya tenía una idea (no muy clara y bastante vaga y hasta confusa, la verdad) de lo que era \"estar\" así con alguien, eso no terminaría bien eso nunca terminaba bien para Forrest - ¿ni con una chica? – El teniente dudaba si creerle o no - Nno – negó apenas con susurro inaudible - ¿te gustaría estar conmigo? – pregunto con delicadeza Gump solo volvió la vista a su teniente, abrió los ojos como platos y en un gesto de terror solo le miro en silencio, ¿Qué acababa de decirle? ¿eso se puede? - ¿Cómmo? – pregunto aterrorizado - ¿no sabes cómo se hace el amor? – pregunto una vez más enarcando la ceja Su madre le dijo que las personas hacían el amor efectivamente cuando se amaban demasiado, pero nunca había escuchado eso antes, ¿\"estar\" con alguien era como hacer el amor? - Eso… ¿Cómo se hace? – pregunto con casta timidez - Si quieres te enseño – bromeo el teniente bastante sonrojado - ¿A hacer el amor? – corroboro arrugando la frente sumamente perdido - Si quieres – respondió encogiéndose de hombros – si quieres te hago el amor - Bu-bueno – asintió sonrojándose hasta parecer un tomate El Teniente asintió también sonriendo encantado no importaba con que estupidez le saliera el soldado Forrest Gump él siempre se sorprendía y disfrutaba cada una de sus monerías… Las siguientes noches Gump se la paso escribiéndole cartas a Jenny, allí acurrucado bajo su impermeable apenas pudiendo iluminar con la linterna una arrugada hojita de papel que cuidadosamente garabateaba con miedo mojarla o romperla apoyándose en una roca, le contaba sobre los paisajes, sobre o curioso del idioma y la comida local, le contaba sobre las lluvias y anunciaba que estaba bien y suplicaba por una respuesta \"aunque sea una carta\" era duro enviar cartas que nunca eran respondidas, el teniente le había explicado que era muy difícil enviarlas y más recibirlas, era mejor esperar otro momento, \"paciencia soldado\" le decía cada vez que se sentaban a comer y como cosa rara le contaba sobre ella en Alabama. Hablaba de su amistad y como ella suplicaba a Dios para convertirla en ave, Forrest lo contaba todo desde una perspectiva bastante ajena y despreocupada \"su padre era muy amoroso se la pasaba besándola a ella y a sus hermanas\" eso le había hecho caer en cuenta de muchas cosas, el teniente sabia interpretar mejor la situación, asintiendo horrorizado solo suplico porque esa pobre chica no saltara de algún edificio o se volviera una hippie de esas que vagan sin hogar rodeadas de drogadictos o que por lo menos ya no trabajara en ese bar - El teniente es un hombre muy sabio – sugirió el soldado en un leve coqueteo - ¿Sabio? No es eso… solo desconfiado, haces bien en cuidarla – respondió mientras comía - El teniente entiende – explicaba sonrojándose más y más con cada palabra como si fuera su declaración de amor- hasta las cosas que todos me dicen que son muy complicadas – suspiro embelesado con una mirada llena de un amor mucho más suave y gentil - usted tiene ese modo de explicarlo todo hasta para que alguien como yo entienda - ¿Cuántas veces tengo que decirte que no eres tonto? – le reprocho - yo soy idiota desde que nací, no es tan malo el teniente le tomo del hombro y mirándole sumamente enfadado solo le regaño una vez mas - tú no eres un idiota, eres la persona más sencilla y lista que conozco, puedes ser torpe a veces, pero… pero… pero eres el mejor – concluyo finalmente sonrojado y furibundo el teniente siguió comiendo sus raciones en silencio, frunciendo el ceño solo cuchareaba sumamente callado Forrest estaba temblando de emoción, nadie le había dicho que era listo o le había halagado con semejante sinceridad, agachando la cabeza se mordía el labio inferior tratando de calmarse antes de salir con alguna cosa fuera de lugar, pero solo pudo concluir con que no importaba que Jenny fuera su chica, pero que el Teniente Dan era probablemente el mejor hombre del mundo, no podría querer a alguien como quería al teniente, él era el hombre de su vida y nunca habría nadie en el mundo que ocupar ese lugar su \"chico\" especial, de no haber estado allí sentados comiendo le hubiera saltado al cuello solo para besarle - tienes un corazón de oro – murmuro el hombre con la boca llena Gump solo le vio en silencio una vez más… con esa curiosidad y ese fuego que le brillaba en la mirada cuando lo miraba a los ojos, no sabía cómo expresar esa profunda admiración, ese eterno respeto y amor que sentía por él, no con palabras, era malo para las palabras sin mencionar que el un completo desastre con eso de \"hacer el amor\", pero sentía esa necesidad de enorgullecerlo de hacerle saber que le amaba con el alma como solo un \"idiota\" podía amar. Un par de días después seguían marchando como siempre, ¡diez kilómetros al norte!, había anunciado el Teniente mientras los demás asentían silenciosos, hasta que alguien le bromeo a Bubba por lo bajito - sí que está de buen humor el Teniente ¿no? - Si – asintió el pescador - De seguro se tiro a alguna vietnamita del arrozal de ayer – bromeo otro soldado - ¿solo a una? Debió tirarse a medio pueblo – refunfuño otro que marchaba atrás - y saqueado todos los cigarrillos del ejercito – dijo uno más que estaba junto a Gump Forrest los miro de reojo, frunció el ceño mientras les escuchaba murmurar, se sintió sumamente ofendido de que hablar así de su Teniente, algo que había aprendido del ejercito era a respetar a los superiores y si aún estuvieran allá en el campo de entrenamiento los hubieran hecho trotar hasta morir de cansancio rodeando el lugar, pero lo que más le hacía doler justo en el pecho era que hablaran mal del teniente, de todos los sargentos coroneles y hasta otros tenientes solo el Teniente Dan había ganado su respeto y admiración como lo había hecho y no había nada que le doliera más, que el hecho de cómo sus hombres se le burlaran mientras él seguía manteniéndolos a todos vivos y a salvo, no era tan tonto y sabía lo que les habían pasado a los otros pelotones que habían tomado la otra ruta, en el radio hablaron del napalm y como otros fueron tomados prisioneros, alguien alguna vez le dijo \"es mejor morir antes que se apresado por el Vietcong\" cuando los capturaban era mejor darlos por muertos, nadie sabía cómo los torturaban hasta matarlos o nadie era capaz de decirlo frente a Forrest una de las ventajas de ser un completo idiota ante los demás es que por lo menos no eran tan directos con esos temas, ya habían visto y vivido suficientes bombardeos como para saber que el entendía - Shhhh – les mano callar señalando el hecho de que no estaba tan lejos - ¿Qué tú también quieres cogerte a alguna amarilla? – renegó un chico con gafas Forrest le lanzo una mirada de reproche impresionante, algo por lo que se conocía al soldado Gump era por su calma y obediencia, no se había metido en ningún lio básicamente nunca, era bastante afable y atento dependiendo la situación y a la hora de luchar peleaba con todo, seguía siendo un hombre alto y robusto por lo que fuerza no le faltaba, nadie quería probar un puño del idiota que sabe cómo reventarle la cara a alguien de un cabezazo… si el hombre más gentil y apacible de toda la armada estadounidense perdía la paciencia y estallaba, simplemente no había donde esconderse y ellos no se salvarían de una buena paliza - Que genio – bromeo el soldado que aseguraba venir de Detroit - Miren – señalo buba a los cielos con una enorme sonrisa en el rostro \"Fue como si se hubiera cerrado un grifo\" explicaría luego, la lluvia solo desapareció y el sol volvió a iluminar con ese brillo cálido y amarillo que tanto extrañaban después de no ver todo ese color en meses, un poco de calidez simplemente inundo sus cansadas almas para dar paso a una leve sorpresa llena de alivio y felicidad, nunca un hombre habría estado tan feliz de ver el sol brillándole justo en la cara hasta cegarlo como lo estaba Forrest en ese instante - Como si fuera un maldito grifo – renegó el teniente Dan entre las risas del pelotón Volviendo la vista se encontró a un Forrest alegre y calmado que apenas si le lanzo una fugaz mirada cargada de ternura y diversión, como si él también hubiera pensado lo mismo, a veces parecía que se pusieran de acuerdo otras solo era que el teniente le entendía mejor que nadie en el mundo, adoraba poder ver ese fuego ese no sé qué en sus ojos que le llenaba de vida… una lástima que los enemigos abrieran fuego y el infierno se desatara sobre ellos una vez más y lo poco que el teniente pudo recordar fue como se arrastraba para llamar refuerzos por la radio y abrieran fuego desde el aire, tomo su arma para disparar y entonces se encontró con la mirada aterrada del soldado Gump que estaba a su lado aun intentando dispararle al enemigo como podía - ¡corre! – ordeno - Pero… - murmuro aún bastante shockeado por el ataque - ¡maldita sea corre de una buena vez! ¡retírense todos! Le sujeto del uniforme y levantándolo del suelo le empujo para que comenzara a correr, el tipo era como un caballo y en menos de nada ya no le podía ver entre las balas y el humo, suspiro aliviado era hora de encontrarse con su destino y encararlo, estaba profundamente agradecido de hacer conocido a Gump, estaba listo y no habría marcha atrás, sintió como el teléfono con el que se comunicaban con la radio dio un fuerte tirón mientras Colman caía muerto, tiro aún más del cable cuando el mismo fue víctima de una granada, era su hora y debería caer con todas las de la ley tomando su arma pido una vez más refuerzos, rogando que sus hombres alcanzaran a huir solo veía como las sombras pasaban fugazmente gritando y corriendo entre el fuego, el dolor le estaba matando pero debía seguir pidiendo ese ataque si debían caer no caerían solos y esos malditos Charlies arderían en napalm, seguía gritando ordenes por la radio que pedían su ubicación no sabía ni como podía seguir siendo coherente mientras se arrastraba en un charco de su propia sangre tirando del cable con tal de seguir dando la alerta - ¡Colman está mmuerto! – grito Forrest agitado y sin alientos ¿Por qué volvió? Debía estar en la costa esperando los helicópteros, a salvo del fuego y los enemigos ¿para que volver? En definitiva, Gump era un idiota - ¡todos lo están, todo mi pelotón está muerto! – espeto sin soltar el radio - Ataque aéreo inminente, evacuen la zona, cambio – anunciaban al otro lado Forrest no se lo pensó solo actuó como era necesario le arranco la maleta y tomándolo como a un costal le llevo lejos, no importaron los gritos ni los puñetazos, el teniente se estaba desangrando y no era capaz ni de mirar las heridas que tenía, se le podía ver la carne destrozada y parte del hueso, sus piernas estaban hechas añicos - ¡suéltame hijo de perra! – gritaba desgarrándose la garganta - ¡debo morir con ellos! ¡es una orden, soldado! ¡lárgate y sálvate tú! Forrest solo seguía corriendo como podía intentando recordar por donde había llegado, él estaba buscando a Bubba pero simplemente no era capaz dejarlos morir así, debía salvarlos, \"si algo te pasara Gump no me lo perdonaría\" recordó fugazmente mientras ahora solo escuchaba los gritos incoherentes del Teniente, estaba furioso gritando sobre el destino y mil burradas más, pero lo que de verdad le estaba haciendo correr a pesar de todo era el hecho de que le siguiera pidiendo que escapara para ponerse a salvo - ¡olvídate de mí, sálvate tu solo! Gump estaba demasiado ocupado como para decir cualquier cosa, una explosión y una ráfaga de disparos los derribo, el teniente ni corto ni perezoso se incorporó como pudo y abrió fuego a lo que sea que estuviera allí, ya no estaba en sus cabales, pero seguía siendo un guerrero - ¡muéranse malditos! – gritaba a todo pulmón Protegiendo a Forrest el cual se levantó a duras penas para tomarlo de la mano y arrastrarlo a donde estaban los demás, no importaba nada a estas alturas o por lo menos eso pensaba el Taylor que no paraba de gritar y tratando de zafarse para que el soldado huyera de una maldita vez… llegaron con los demás y allí tirado en el suelo el teniente le agarro con todas sus fuerzas - ¡no debías sacarme de allá! Forrest una vez mas no dijo nada solo le vio con ojos suplicantes y aterrados antes de marcharse de nuevo ¿qué estaba haciendo ese condenado? - ¡están por bombardearlo todo! ¡arrasaran la zona! ¿a dónde vas? - ¡debo encontrar a Bubba! – explico finalmente Una vez más el teniente lo entendió todo, no sabía cómo el siempre entendía a Gump a final de cuentas era un hombre de mente simple y alma sencilla… soltando al soldado lo dejo irse corriendo a su inminente muerte, pronto todo sería consumido por el fuego, hasta el mismo seria víctima de las bombas o quizás sus heridas lo matarían finalmente, no había nada que hacer solo dejar al destino hacer lo suyo, vio cómo se alejaba corriendo como solo Gump sabia correr, y en silencio Dan Taylor solo se quedó allí escuchando las explosiones como si fuesen truenos a lo lejos, el humo lo inundaba todo y los gritos de sus hombres al morir, era su hora y estaba más que listo por que oficialmente lo había perdido todo y no había nada por que vivir, pronto Forrest Gump sería un montón de cenizas, de carne muerta y no había nada que el pudiera hacer, era el fin[Chapter 3] Las cálidas noches en Vietnam eran muy calmadas a pesar del constante estado de alerta de las tropas, para Forrest no había nada como sentarse a un lado del camino y ver las estrellas para una vez más pensar en lo único que de verdad le llegaba a preocupar desde hace años \"¿Qué estará haciendo Jenny? ¿dónde estará?\" esa idea de saber cómo estaría ella era una constante que prácticamente lo guiaba, el soñar con abrazarla una vez más y sentir sus besos suaves como el algodón de azúcar, la amaba como a nada en la vida, un amor tan idealizado y platónico… el mismo sabía que ella no le amaba ni le miraría como a un amante, ella solo le veía como ese amigo de toda la vida, no importaba cuantas veces le ofreciera su corazón ella siempre declinaría a sus propuestas de una vida juntos - Jennny – murmuro solitario y triste - ¿otra vez esa Jenny? – pregunto el Teniente que estaba a su lado El Teniente Dan era un hombre bueno, seguro y decidido, Forrest le miraba siempre lleno de profundo respeto y admiración, ese hombre a pesar de ser unos cuantos años mayor, se veía tan joven como el mismo Forrest, esa mirada perspicaz y fiera que se dibuja en esos pálidos ojos azules eternamente atentos y curiosos, aunque le diera vergüenza admitirlo ni los ojos de Jenny eran así de bonitos, Jenny tenía esa mirada suave y triste pero el Teniente bueno el Teniente era tan determinado y atento que Forrest no hacía más que seguirle como un pollito tras una gallina, obedeciendo cada advertencia cada orden, con un solo gesto el Teniente ya tenía al soldado a su disposición dispuesto a recibir órdenes y cumplirlas a la perfección - Jennny es mi muy mejor amiga, señor – respondió el hombre parándose derecho - ¿la amas? –pregunto curioso Forrest volvió la vista para ver que el Teniente estaba como cosa rara sin camisa, exhibiendo esa ancha espalda y esos fornidos brazos, era tan blanco como un vaso de leche a pesar de lo duro que podía ser el viaje, su piel seguía intacta sin manchas, sin picaduras sin quemaduras, era perfecto, Forrest no sabía sin sentir una vez más admiración o celos ante semejante hombre… el Teniente dan se sentó a su lado mirándole desde abajo solo siguió acomodándose entre la hierba, era suave y húmeda, los bichos cantaban haciendo que los suaves murmullos entre ellos no fueran nada, era imposible despertar al pelotón mientras susurraran - Ella es mmi chica – suspiro algo avergonzado de decir semejante cosa Al final de cuentas todos sus conocidos hablaban así de sus esposas y novias, sus chicas desde que estaba en la universidad sus compañeros del equipo hablaban de sus chicas, de sus amantes y ligues de una noche, siendo gráficos y hasta vulgares, eso le espantaba demasiado, así que él lo tomaba más por un lado más familiar para él, su amiga y el hecho de amarla incondicionalmente - ¿ella te espera? ¿allá en Alabama? – el Teniente estaba aburrido por el modo en que preguntaba, probablemente solo estaba haciéndole charla - No… ella se fue lejos - ¿entonces como sigue siendo tu chica? – estaba intrigado por como enarcaba su ceja - Emmmm ella solo es mmi chica especial – se explicaba lentamente tratando de pensar El Teniente sujeto a Forrest del brazo bajándolo a su nivel entre la hierba, Forrest solo se acomodó obediente como el dulce chico que era, se le quedo viendo en silencio mientras el Teniente solo le analizaba de arriba abajo y con una sonrisita de medio lado le inquirió - ¿eres tonto? ¿acaso crees que ella te esperara? - Ella… ella… - eso le había dolido ¿acaso ella tenía que hacerlo? - ¿si quiera te beso? – pregunto intentando entender el retraso mental del soldado - Si… y me abrazo… - intento recordad bastante patidifuso – Tenniente Dann El Teniente solo negaba con la cabeza impresionado por la ingenuidad de su soldado preferido, era tan buen muchacho que simplemente le ofendía que esa tal \"Jenny\" no le hablara claro, si no le quería que lo mandara a freír espárragos de una buena vez, solo no podía entender cómo era posible escribirle y suspirar por ella sin siquiera una respuesta o alguna esperanza esperándole en casa, se sintió identificado en eso… no tenía a nadie esperándole en casa, estaba mejor en esa jungla infestada de charlies que en New York - Forrest, tú te mereces a alguien que si te aprecie – sentencio finalmente - Ella mme a precia – respondió sumamente ofendido - No, alguien que te \"quiera\" alguien que esté dispuesto a amarte – intento explicarse Un silencio sumamente incómodo y tenso inundo la noche ni los grillos o las chicharras podían hacer más ameno el ambiente, Forrest estaba perdido en la seria mirada del Teniente, ese aire de preocupación era nuevo, era íntimo y acogedor, se sentía más seguro al lado del Teniente de lo que había estado en mucho tiempo, si debía combatir toda esta guerra rogaba a Dios que siempre pudiera estar al lado del su Teniente, no por nada siempre se ofrecía a hacer la guardia junto a él, era la más pesada al estar revisando todo y rondando \"por si acaso\" nadie más estaba dispuesto a pasar casi media noche en esas junto al superior juzgándoles por su ineptitud - ¿Cómmo quién? – pregunto una vez más profundamente perdido - Debes buscar a alguien a quien amar y que te amé de igual manera – sugirió encogiéndose de hombros – tu tienes que buscarla… eso ya es problema tuyo - ¿P-por qué no Jennny? – pregunto con la mirada mucho más sombría de lo normal - Si tengo entendido, Jenny no te ama… te quiere como un hermano no como un novio Era verdad Forrest hablaba de Jenny día y noche, incluso los demás soldados bromeaban al respecto, pero solo con Bubba y el Teniente tenían suficiente confianza como para mencionar esos detalles tan personales llenos de sus inseguridades y realidades muy complicadas para su gusto, era mejor el día a día ocupándose en lo que fuera antes de volver a suspirar por los eternos risos dorados de Jenny, esas suaves manos cálidas y esa voz tan dulce y amorosa como de un ángel - ¿Cómo es el amor de un novio? – estaba intrigado, él nunca había tenido novia El Teniente se quedó perplejo, era la respuesta más difícil de decir, no sabía cómo explicar el amor que se le tiene a una amante, mucho menos a alguien tan sencillo y suave como Forrest - Un novio se preocupa, se… se… siente feliz y hace feliz a su novia, tu sabes hacen… cosas Estaba siente indo que él era el tonto a estas alturas, no sabía ni como decirlo, estaba muy apenado de su ineptitud como mentor, el mismo había fracasado como novio y amante desde hace años, la milicia le había consumido su vida social y sentimental, el solo vivía por su honor, su destino y por supuesto su patria… o eso creía hasta que recibió a esos nuevos soldados, cuando Forrest se presentó y le juro que haría hasta lo imposible para no fallarle se sintió alagado, se sintió con una enorme responsabilidad para con ese soldado, no debía fallarle, debía protegerle de todo mal y peligro, ese apego cada día mas fuerte hacia ese tonto que solo sabía asentir con una suave sonrisita le estaba comenzando a cobrar factura… estaba comenzando a sentir esa necesidad de estar a su lado y guiarle, de cuidarle, abrigarle - Gump no es por nada… pero tú ya la amas como un novio ama Esa conclusión confundió al pobre soldado, si él Amaba así ¿Por qué estaba mal? - ¿ella me ammara así? – pregunto al aire completamente ensimismado Apretando los puños, solo tomo aire intentando calmarse, estaba asustado y triste de pensar en semejantes cosas, Jenny no era así... ella era dulce con él... ella algún día sabría amarlo como él la amaba a ella en cuerpo y alma, hasta el final - Ni idea – respondió el Teniente con una actitud más reservada - Tenniente Dann – pregunto con la voz algo quebrada - Dime… - asintió preocupado por ese gesto Forrest de repente estaba con los ojos llorosos, las mejillas y la nariz rojas y temblando como un niño que trata en vano de calmar el llanto, gimoteando por lo bajo solo pudo sollozar entre susurros tristes y desolados que por poco le desgarran el alma a Dan Taylor - ¿alguien po-podria amarmme así? – concluyo destrozado Si el Teniente dudaba hasta del eterno amor de Jenny solo significaba una cosa. Forrest no era digno de ser amado ante los ojos de nadie, era un retardado como todos le gritaban, era un bobo que no merecía ser amado, nadie le amaría y solo merecía la lastima de otros, estaba destrozado con pensar en algo tan triste, ¿Qué hizo mal? ¿había algo malo con él? Estaba sumamente triste a estas alturas rompiendo en un llanto silente y amargo, empapándose en sus propias lagrimas - Claro que te amaran así – aseguro el superior con un brillo especial en su mirada - ¿Lo… lo cree? – gimoteo con un hipo bastante tierno e infantil - Si – asintió solemnemente – que me parta un rayo si nadie te llega apreciar Forrest sintió de nuevo arder la esperanza en su pecho y con una débil sonrisa en la comisura de los labios se arrimó al Teniente para darle un tierno abrazo, Forrest era de los que no le ven nada de malo a un abrazo o a demostrar afecto a los demás, su madre le había enseñado así - Forrest – susurro el Teniente algo incomodo - ¿Si? - Quítate. Habían pasado unos días y Forrest estaba aún más incómodo ante la presencia del Teniente, Bubba ahora hacia la guardia con el Teniente, el cual estaba muy en lo suyo protegiendo y guiando a sus hombres, era como el pastor de este rebaño asegurándose de la supervivencia de hasta el último de ellos, era tan noble y valeroso, quería seguirle hasta el fin del mundo, quería demostrarle su aprecio, su cariño, su amor… era difícil de explicar cómo el apego que siente por Jenny era tan distinto y similar al que sentía por el Teniente, el Teniente era algo menos idealizado y perfecto ante sus ojos, era más una cuestión humana, una cosa terrenal, como si algo en su pecho se sintiera cálido y suave a su lado, no tuviera miedo, dolor o cansancio alguno, como un bálsamo que le aliviaba y le hacía fuerte. Jenny era otra historia ella se sentía como una enorme felicidad, como una calma indescriptible, como cuando se va a la feria todo consiste en la expectativa y la diversión que significa el riesgo de las atracciones, las golosinas y la buena compañía, el Teniente Dan era como beber una Dr Pepper bien fría durante el mediodía en el cálido verano de Greenbow, algo que más que imaginárselo y luego vivir el sueño para sentirse vacío después, se sentía tan propio y llenador, como que quieres otro sorbo y beber hasta quedar sin aliento - Gump hoy te toca guardia – ordeno a lo lejos con su cigarrillo en los labios - Si señor – respondió obediente como siempre Agachando la cabeza amarro sus zapatos y marcho para hacer la guardia, esperando una vez más a Bubba para su turno, pero valla sorpresa cuando el Teniente llego para plantarse a su lado con un aire desafiante, Forrest sol respingo un poco tratando de contener la alegría de ver al Teniente, estaban cubiertos de tierra y hojas, habían caminado muchísimo entre la espesa jungla, no habían caminos y esta noche las estrellas no se podrían ver por las altas copas de los árboles, el Teniente estaba armado hasta los dientes ya que no estaban seguros si habrían animales peligrosos en la zona, Forrest paso saliva y siguió en lo suyo vigilando el campamento a lo lejos - ¿Cómo estás? – pregunto el Teniente con voz suave y cansada - Bien – asintió el soldado con una suave sonrisita - Bien… estas hecho mierda, muchacho – le regaño al ver lo pálido que estaba - Estoy bien-n Tenniente Dan - afirmo algo nervioso por esa nueva actitud El Teniente solo asintió viéndole fijamente, estaba muy pálido y nervioso ¿estaría enfermo? O acaso desobedeció sus indicaciones de seguridad y tenía los pies destrozados eso le hizo sentir un enorme vacío en la boca del estómago como si la culpa recayera en sus hombros, si el no podía cuidar se sus hombres ¿Quién más lo haría? Como su superior insistió mucho más serio - Gump ¿Qué tienes? ¿te hirieron o algo? - No señor – respondió cabizbajo - ¿Te volvieron a tratar de tonto? – pregunto algo enojado No había nada que hiciera enojar más en el mundo al Teniente Dan que el hecho de que trataran a Gump de tonto o idiota, simplemente no lo toleraba - No – Forrest se veía muy incómodo – señor - ¿Qué te duele? ¿estas enfermo? – el superior estaba frunciendo el ceño en un gesto grave - Señor… ¿Cuándo volveremmos a casa? Esa pregunta le dejo helado ¿ellos podrían si quiera volver a casa? No lo sabía y debía ser sincero ante el hecho que en cualquier momento caerían o serian atacados - Es una guerra Forrest, no hay mucho que hacer - ¿solo nno dejarse mmatar? – pregunto mucho más serio - Exacto… si le pasa algo a alguno de ustedes seria mi culpa – se explicaba encogido de hombros – si algo te pasara Gump no me lo perdonaría… Forrest se le quedo viendo fijamente con los labios entreabiertos, y un silencio sumamente profundo, no era un ambiente incómodo, al contrario, era un silencio acogedor y cálido - Ojalá pudiera acabar la guerra – continuo el Teniente – ojalá pudieras volver a casa - No immporta si no acaba la guerra – concluyo el hombre más joven ensimismado - ¿Por qué? – respondió confundido - Porque, por lo menos puedo estar junto al Teniente – concluyo con una dulce sonrisa Dan se sintió diminuto y frágil ante semejante conclusión, Forrest siempre le decía que su madre hablaba de una caja de chocolates, pues para Dan Taylor Forrest era esa caja de chocolates, nunca sabia con qué le iba a salir ahora, se sintió tan pequeño en esa inmensa y oscura selva viendo fijamente a esos ojos que no era ni azules ni verdes, esa mirada tan dulce y suave le lleno de una calidez que no recordaba en años, no había sentido tanto cariño en un millón de años, se sentía profundamente en deuda con ese soldado pasara lo que pasara debería cuidarlo cual tesoro - No seas tonto, la guerra es mala… - Mammá dice que tonto es el que hace tonterías – respondió - Pues querer estar conmigo en la guerra es una tontería – explicaba el mayor - ¿es mmalo querer estar con usted? – pregunto arrugando ligeramente la frente - Si… yo estoy aquí porque es mi destino y tengo tanto por demostrar, tu no entiendes - Mammá dice que la vida es como un… - Si ya se ya se… como una caja de chocolates… no sabes que te va a tocar Se siguieron mirando en silencio, allí de pie sin decirse o hacer nada, pudieron pasar dos minutos o mil años, pero se sintió como si el mundo solo se hubiera detenido en ese instante, sus miradas estaban fijas en el otro, una suave sonrisa se dibujó en la comisura de los labios del Teniente, ya no se sentía en una enorme selva en el fin del mundo, Forrest se sonrojó ligeramente al verle sonreír y bajando la mirada tímidamente al suelo - Forrest – le llamó suavemente tomándole del hombro - Si señor – respondió el soldado sin mirarle a la cara Dan solo tomo aire y antes de darle tiempo a cualquier duda o reacción le planto un beso en la mejilla justo donde iniciaban los labios del joven, esperando una reacción violenta se alejó un poco, pero solo encontró con que el muchacho estaba rojo como un tomate, temblando como un plato de gelatina, prendado de tanta dulce inocencia e ingenuidad que no eran dignas de este mundo y menos de esta guerra tan larga y cruenta, dan solo suspiro enarcando la ceja - Tenniente Dann – dijo finalmente con apenas un hilito de voz - Dime – respondió en apenas un susurro Y contra todo pronóstico volvió la vista fija a su Teniente, el hombre mayor apenas si titubeo un segundo antes de que el joven soldado le devolviera el beso, un casto beso en los labios, sin caricias o abrazos como lo hacen las personas normalmente, solo poso firmemente sus labios sobre los suyos, se sentían cálidos, no eran suaves como los besos de Jenny, sus labios se sentían secos y rotos, su aliento era cálido, Forrest había cerrado los ojos con tal fuerza que veía chispitas como cuando los aprietan con las manos, tenía tanta pena de hacer esto pero algo en su interior le pedía a gritos hacerlo, no podría vivir o morir un día más en Vietnam hasta besar a ese amable y valeroso hombre, en su momento no le pareció malo o sucio, ¿acaso no besas a alguien cuando lo amas? Recordó cuando una vez hacia un par de años atrás pilló por error a dos de sus compañeros del equipo de football besándose bajo las gradas, no eran besos tiernos o ligeros como cuando veía a su vecina darle besos de despedida a su novio, eran besos muy profundos y bruscos, como si se pelearan y a la vez se dieran cariño, intrigado solo vio en silencio por un corto instante para luego irse, no dijo nada porque él tenía más vergüenza por fijarse en esas cosas que por meterse en la vida de otros, no le parecía educado o cortes decirles algo después en los entrenamientos. El Teniente no retrocedió en cambio devolvió nuevamente el beso, otro beso igual de casto y gentil, tomo suavemente su mano, no como para agarrarla solo posando ligeramente su mano sobre la del soldado, el más joven dejo de temblar, y entreabriendo un poco los labios indico que estaba listo para un beso más apasionado, Dan comenzó a besarle con más fuerza, moviendo sus labios mientras el soldado seguía el compás con torpeza y pudor, Forrest le tomo la otra mano y entrelazando los dedos le sujeto gentilmente para acercarlo mas, los besos iban y venían los suspiros silenciosos y exhalaciones ahogadas ni se sentían entre el ruido suave y a su vez ensordecedor de la jungla - Tenniente Dann – suspiro finalmente ya sin aire en sus pulmones Separándose un poco se miraron en silencio, acalorados y temblorosos tenían tanta adrenalina corriendo por sus sistemas más que en cualquier batalla, Forrest se sujetó con fuerza de la mano del capitán que solo le miraba sonrojado y nervioso, temía por que les pillaran prefería morir con el enemigo que ser descubierto por alguno de sus soldados. Había pasado un rato estaban en un cómodo y cariñoso silencio entre miradas tiernas y uno que otro besito fugaz en cualquier lado de la cara, las manos sudorosas de Forrest se negaban a soltar el tembloroso agarre del Teniente - Forrest – llamo su atención finalmente Forrest asintió mientras sonreía, estaba tan dichoso que no cabía en sí, era como vivir el sueño, su mayor sueño sentir el calor del Teniente, su cariño y admiración eran tan grandes que no hacía más que pensar en él, siempre que veía el cielo estrellado pensaba en Jenny y le extrañaba en silencio, pero la oscuridad, el camino, las explosiones incluso la sola amenaza de morir en alguna trampa le recordaba que él estaría allí para protegerle, Forrest quería sentir ese abrigo por siempre, no le gustaba que le cuidaran o le trataran como un inútil pero cuando el Teniente le guiaba hasta el mismo se hacia el Tonto - ¿podrías guardar el secreto? – pregunto el mayor trayéndole a la realidad - ¿Cuál Secreto? – susurro confundido - Este secreto – explico en murmullos – este es nuestro secreto - ¿nuestro secreto? – frunció el ceño sintiéndose caer en picada de la nube - Esto es el ejército ¿recuerdas? Esto no puede salirse de la jungla – anuncio cabizbajo - Okay – asintió resignado ¿acaso se avergonzaba de él? - Bien – suspiro plantándole un beso en la frente como a un niño pequeño – te quiero - Yo tammbién lo quiero Teniente Dan Volviendo a abrazar al soldado esta vez el fuego se había apagado, la cruda realidad era otra y no importaba el ensueño de un fugaz instante en medio de la espesa selva, estaban de guardia y faltaba bastante para que esa guerra acabara y mucho más para poder si quiera ser algo más que un Teniente y su subordinado y quien sabe cuánto más para que pudieran tomarse de la mano en público y en plena luz del día, probablemente eso nunca pasara pero para Dan Taylor ese instante en medio de la noche sería probablemente su único buen recuerdo del infierno que fue Vietnam[Chapter 4] En menos de nada y así como así el soldado Gump recibió otra condecoración (cosa que no le causo ninguna impresión) para finalmente marcharse dando por terminado su servicio militar, fue cuestión de recibir la noticia para cuando él ya estaba corriendo a buscar un teléfono y llamar a Dan que probablemente estaría bebiendo sin importar que fuese medio día, desde que relativamente habían hecho las paces se la pasaba llamándolo a diario y si tenía mucha suerte puede que el ex teniente estuviera de buen humor y le llamara también - ¿bueno? – contestaron respondiendo con ese tono ronco y desganado tan habitual - Soy yo – saludo a su teniente jugueteando con el cable del teléfono – ya nno estoy en el ejército – anunciaba con dulzura - ¿puedo ir a quedarmme allá? Al otro lado de la línea se escuchó una risita seca seguida de una toz, era curioso como la hostilidad del teniente iba y venía como las mareas, todo era cuestión de pillarle en un buen momento, después de recuperar un poco la compostura le aseguro con algo de habilidad - Mi casa es tu casa - Iré hoy mismo – dijo Gump bastante alegre y con una enorme sonrisa en los labios - Apropósito de eso ¿Qué paso con la promesa que le hiciste a Bubba? –pregunto en un tono sumamente serio - ¿no que serias capitán? ¿eh Gilligan? – insistió al no recibir respuesta del soldado - Si… - ¿entonces? Debes ir a donde sea que tenían ese pozo mágico de camarones – explico irónicamente antes de hacer una pequeña pausa - ¿no quieres ir a ver a tu mamá? Forrest se alejó un poco de la bocina del teléfono mirando el infinito, la bomba que le había soltado lo había dejado en blanco, odiaba cuando el Teniente le decía cosas tan complicadas o enredadas que ni el mismo podía explicar, recapacito un poco arrugando la frente, pesando las posibilidades y la importancia de lo que estaba por decidir, acercándose otra vez el teléfono para contestar solo tenía una cosa clara, quería estar junto al Teniente Dan - Venga conmigo – sugirió con timidez - ¿a dónde? - pregunto bastante a la defensiva al juzgar ese tono hostil en su voz - A Greenbow Alabama – respondió encogiéndose de hombros - ¿me estas jodiendo? ¿cierto? – rio bastante alterado, hasta se escuchaba el crujir del plástico del teléfono como si apretara la bocina con fuerza - ¿sabes lo que pasaría si se enteran de que tú y yo…? Bueno… ya sabes… - ¡usted dijo que era por el ejército! – interrumpió bastante asustado de recibir un no - ¡ya no estamos en el ejército, Forrest! ¡es que tu no entiendes! - ¡yo no sé mucho de casi nada! – respondió temblando de frustración – pero… - ¿tienes idea de cómo es la gente en el sur con los negros? ¿acaso no me dijiste que estudiabas en esa universidad de Alabama? tienes idea de que pasaría si… - ¿Qué se supone que deba saber? – pregunto confundido y bastante regañado - Olvídalo… simplemente te lo voy a plantear así – explico pausadamente - ¿Cómo va a reaccionar tu madre si te ve conmigo en vez de con Jenny? ¿hmmm? - Ella no tiene que saber – sugirió enarcando una ceja - Oh, chico listo – rio suavemente al otro lado de la línea – y pensar que todos me decían que eras retardado… - ¿entonces sí? - pregunto con un gesto de absoluta confusión - … - no se escuchaba si no una leve respiración – sí, que demonios. Está bien iré - Buenno – respondió Gump suspirando al aire y poniendo ojitos de ternero degollado La señora Gump había recibido la llamada de su hijo avisándole de que por fin había salido de prestar su servicio militar, la guerra aún estaba, pero ¿acaso el chico no era héroe nacional? Lo mínimo que debían haber hecho era haberle devuelto a su hijo hacia años, ¡su pobre niño no la pudo visitar en años!, ella y la señorita Louis lo prepararon todo, el almuerzo, la habitación que llevaba tanto tiempo sin usarse que tenía una gruesísima capa de polvo sobre todo, el lugar tendría un par de días olor ha guardado pero ella estaba segura que él ni se daría cuenta mientras le contaba todo lo que vivió allá, en el mejor de los casos vendría con Jenny, \"ahí como ama a esa niña\" pensó risueña mientras escuchaba al taxi pitar en el camino frente a la entrada - Ya llego – anuncio la mujer de color - Está bien, acomoda esas raquetas Era un nuevo detalle, le había hecho tantas propuestas de negocio que ahora no sabía cómo le plantearía a su hijo todo el dinero de por medio si aceptaba un par de contratos de publicidad con artículos deportivos, abrió la puerta con el mosquitero cuando lo vio allí, derechito como una regla, perfectamente uniformado, sosteniendo ese pesado equipaje en la misma maleta con la que lo vio partir a la guerra y con esa luz en sus ojitos que tanto la hacían adorarlo - Hola mammá – la saludo con una tierna mirada La mujer lo abrazo y le dio un beso en la mejilla, estallando en lágrimas de alegría apenas saco su pañuelo para secar sus mejillas estaba dichosa de la vida, ella apenas si noto que el taxi seguía frente a la entrada, el conductor bajo un par de maletas más por lo que ella se imaginó que su hijo le traía recuerdos o alguna cosa así cuando vio como un hombre desaliñado y con una cara de pocos amigos impresionante se movía en una silla de ruedas para pagarle al conductor mientras renegaba manoteando y básicamente cabreado por todo - Mammá, él es mi amigo el Teniente Dann – explico Gump sonrojado tímidamente La mujer estaba boqui abierta al ver como el sujeto de largos y rizados cabellos se plantaba frente a ellos encendiendo un cigarro sin siquiera hacer un gesto o decir alguna palabra - Mucho gusto en conocerlo – se presentó ella finalmente - Encantado de conocerla Señora Gump, dígame Dan – dijo siendo sumamente educado - Tenniente Dan mi Mammá, Mammá el Teniente Dan – Forrest los presento sacando pecho La mujer bajo los escalones pasa darle la mano al hombre que primero se quitó los gastados guantes dedos que usaba para mover la silla, era un sujeto bastante casual, con esos dibujos hippy de su camisa, ella concluyo que al ser veterano de la guerra debió unirse a esos movimientos pacifistas o algo así, \"quizás era amigo de Jenny\" - Cariño ¿podemos hablar un instante? – pregunto a su hijo que se puso más pálido que un vaso de leche y abriéndole los ojos como si le fuera a dar la reprimenda de su vida - Buenno – asintió temblando como un plato de gelatina mientras miraba al Teniente Ella le pidió que entrara al porche y en un tono disimulado le reprocho bastante preocupada - Debiste avisarme que traerías amigos, cariño solo tenía lista una habitación - Nno te preocupes – aseguro el algo más aliviado – si quieres podemos compartir cuarto Ella apenas entrecerró los ojos haciendo una mueca divertida asintió - Bueno debes estar acostumbrado a dormir en la misma habitación con veinte muchachos más… de seguro dejar un colchón en tu cuarto no sea problema mientras mañana - Si… - movía la mano en un gesto despreocupado – cosa de todos los días, tu sabes… Cuando lograron subir las maletas ella vio impactada por la fuerza que tenía su hijo, tomando la silla de ruedas con todo y teniente lo subió hasta dejarle en el primer piso de la casa, el hombre apenas asintió agradecido con un aire de seriedad admirable - Gracias Gump – murmuro encendiendo un puro - ¿así que? ¿Qué lo trae por Greenbow Teniente Dan? – pregunto la mujer algo nerviosa - Vacaciones – respondió enarcando una ceja Comenzó a dar rienda suelta al numerito que habían ensayado con Forrest desde el principio, eran unas simples vacaciones, algo de hospitalidad cristiana y una amistad de muchos años y punto final. No más preguntas no más respuestas fuera de eso, el plan era perfecto y mientras no se dejarán ver en ninguna situación comprometedora podrían llevar su \"noviazgo\" sin problemas - Vera – explicaba bastante convincente – su hijo me hablo tan bien de Alabama que decidí conocerla- señalo el campo donde apenas se escuchaban las cigarras y los grillos - ¿tan interesante le pareció Alabama? – pregunto confundida - ¡Alabama es genial! – espeto Forrest bastante nervioso de mentirle a su madre - ¡si! – asintió el mayor viendo todo el pastizal atrás de el – ¡esta mejor de lo que pensé! - ¿desean almorzar? – interrumpió Louis al ver lo extraño que se estaba tornando todo Pasaron los días y Forrest estaba con su madre negociando el asunto de la raqueta de Ping Pong, ella insistía en que una mentira blanca no sería tan grave, por su parte el ex teniente se la pasaba sentado junto a un ventilador bebiendo cerveza, esa condenada casa por más grande bonita y acogedora que fuese tenia mil desniveles y un millar de escalones que lo tenían chocando contra todo, termino dejando la silla a un lado para arrastrarse por ahí para ver la televisión que tenía Forrest en su cuarto, dormían en habitaciones contiguas y compartían el mismo balcón, nada mal para estar en la mitad de la nada y a cuarenta minutos del pueblo, si no fuera por los demás inquilinos hasta se hubiera quedado directamente a vivir allá, pero las cosas estaban claras, toda esa calma era por tiempo limitado, mientras se le acababa el dinero de la pensión y tenía que volver a New York o en el peor de los casos y el mayor de sus miedos ocurría… Jenny regresaría dispuesta a volver con Forrest. Él sabía perfectamente que su amante no tardaría ni dos segundos en olvidarse de todas las empalagosas promesas de amor que se decían cuando estaban solos para correr a los brazos de la rubia que tanto amaba desde básicamente siempre - Creo que debería ir a New York – comento fumando uno de sus puros - ¿Por qué? ¿nno te gusta acá? – pregunto el menor arrugando la frente - Podría ser peor – murmuro encogiéndose de hombros – no debería estar acá, es todo… Forrest le tomo la mano y entrelazando sus dedos le miro con esos ojos suplicantes que le ponía siempre que comenzaba con su pesimismo mañanero - No entiendo – susurro en un suspiro cargado de tristeza - No me hagas esa cara – le reclamo rodando los ojos – ella sabe – cuchicheo señalando la apartada cocina donde estaba la madre de Forrest – ella lo sabe – aseguro enojado - Nno, ella no sabe – insistía tomándole la otra mano para que le viera a los ojos – ella no Dan apenas le miro un instante antes de bufar fastidiado, estaba más paranoico que cuando combatieron en Vietnam, tomando otra calada escupió el humo a un lado para luego zafar su mano y apagar el cigarro en el viejo cenicero que Forrest le regalo para que no dejara cenizas por todas partes y no causar problemas con su madre - Solo son unas vacaciones – explicaba algo más serio – no es como que vivamos aquí ¿o sí? - ¿Por qué nno? – ofreció Gump en una actitud conciliadora – me gusta aquí… - Si – le respondió con un aire bastante odioso – porque es tu casa… Forrest sonrió con un gesto travieso antes de robarle un suave y efímero besito, Dan le respondió con otro más brusco que por poco le da un cabezazo y algo más relajado le dijo - Soldado, no me vas a convencer con un par de mimos - Pues tendré que esforzarme – coqueteo para rematar besándole la mejilla La señora Gump se escuchaba a lo lejos llamando a su hijo para que la ayudara con el desayuno, Dan apenas agudizaba el oído para tratar de entender las ordenes que la mujer le daba al pelinegro cuando escucho algo que le hizo reír a carcajada limpia obviamente delatándolo - Y dile a tu amigo que deje de beber cerveza antes de las nueve de la mañana La señora Gump era un caso aparte ella había visto de todo gracias al pequeño negocio de rentar los cuartos, desde viajeros y turistas hasta fugitivos de la ley… Un hombre destrozado por la guerra no era nada que un hubiera visto antes, de seguro vivía de la pensión del gobierno (o eso le dijo su hijo) ya que se veía a kilómetros que ni familia debía tener, alguien con un hogar no se marchaba a un diminuto y olvidado condado en el último rincón de Alabama de \"vacaciones\". Ella siempre trataba de congeniar charlando de temas triviales como el clima y el siempre respondía bastante formal y directo cosa que cuando estaba Forrest presente cambiaba bastante, se veía que eran muy buenos amigos por la complicidad con la que se hablaban, la gentileza con la que Forrest le trataba, aunque siempre Dan le respondiera con tres piedras en la mano, cada día mientras ella lo encontraba bebiendo veía asomarse más y más la profunda tristeza y dolor en el que él vivía envuelto hasta que una tarde ella comenzó a llenarse de curiosidad por la amistad de esos dos… poco antes de que Forrest se marchara de nuevo, ella se sentó junto a Dan para preguntarle sobre Jenny, pero este solo se encogió de hombros mientras respondía bastante a la defensiva - Nunca la he visto, el me hablo mucho de ella, pero nunca la he podido conocer Taylor se la paso con un humor espantoso el resto del día no había nada que le hiciera cambiar de expresión o por lo menos eso pensó la señora Gump cuando vio como se le ilumino el rostro dibujando una pícara sonrisa al ver entrar a Forrest por la puerta con el recado… cualquiera diría que eran los mejores amigos aun con ese aire tan protector de Taylor para con Gump o esa amorosa dulzura con la que Forrest le seguía. \"Los mejores amigos en todo el mundo\" si no fuera por un pequeño detalle, fue cosa de que Forrest mencionara por casualidad o por error a la famosísima Jenny para desatar nuevamente los muy mal disimulados celos del ex teniente como si se tratara de una granada de mano - ¿si tanto la extrañas por que no la buscas? – espeto antes de marchar a su cuarto Gump se quedó paralizado mirando la puerta que acababan de azotar dudoso de acercarse o no a la boca del lobo, la señora Gump ahora estaba más que intrigada entonces una idea al principio bastante vaga y fugaz cruzo por su mente, pero cada vez se asentaba con más fuerza, echando raíces hasta ser una incógnita frecuente y nada silenciosa \"¿acaso a él le gusta Forrest?\". Esa misma noche ella se aproximó a su hijo y le entrego el cheque con el dinero, ella estaba dispuesta a preguntar algo más, pero prefirió guardar prudencia - ¿no crees que es hora de que tu amigo vuelva a casa? Cuando Forrest escucho a su mamá decirle semejante cosa se sintió tan diminuto y vacío que no pudo disimular la cara de espanto que puso mientras negaba con la cabeza ¿Cómo se le ocurría echar al teniente? Si el teniente volvía a estar solo no se lo perdonaría nunca, si con Jenny eran pan y mantequilla con el teniente eran como los polos opuestos de un imán, no podían estar el uno sin él otros y aunque los separaras volverían a juntarse - Él puede quedarse el tiempo que quiera – contesto finalmente frunciendo el ceño Ella sospechaba que tal vez esa amistad fuese algo más para Taylor, no por nada era tan posesivo, pero al ver la temerosa reacción de su hijo. Solo concluyo que eso no era del todo platónico… Fue cuestión de recibir el dinero para que Forrest arrancara para Bayou La Batre a cumplir la promesa que le hizo a Bubba, el teniente le dijo que se quedaría un tiempo allí, le gustaba la comida y estaba bastante cómodo cuando se sentaba en el banco de la entrada que se mecía haciendo crujir esas viejas cadenas \"es como un columpio\". Forrest salió de casa bastante desanimado de tener que ir solo, la verdad el esperaba que se fueran juntos para tener más privacidad por decirlo así, detestaba tener que mentirle a su mamá y odiaba más que solo podía entrar al cuarto del Teniente Dan cuando todos estaban dormidos. Después de comprar finalmente el barco y saludar la tumba de Bubba decidió enviarle una carta (bastante personal por no decir que sería la prueba incriminatoria definitiva si les pillaban en su dichoso secreto) a Dan avisándole de que ya era oficialmente el capitán de un barco, paso unos días tratando de aprender a navegar y unos más tratando de pescar algo que no fuera basura, siendo el hazmerreír de la mitad de los pescadores que se la pasaban en el puerto, un día mientras contaba los tres camarones que tenía en sus manos un viejo pescador que siempre le hablaba riéndose por básicamente todo miro el barco para luego advertirle - No puedes andar con un barco sin nombre, es de mala suerte. – explicaba sonriente Esa noche se la paso en vela meciéndose en la pequeña hamaca que instalo en el barco para poder dormir sin necesidad de pagar una renta (como le había dicho su muy mejor amigo), se la paso pensándolo una y otra vez: ¿Qué nombre podría ponerle? Fue allí cuando lo recordó, llenando de una suave y duce calidez su corazón y pensando en según el \"el nombre más bonito del mundo\" garabateo a la mañana siguiente el nombre de \"JENNY\" pensando en ella y extrañándola en un anhelo de saber si estaría bien, ¿estará sola? ¿será como Joan Báez? ¿será feliz? Se estaba entristeciendo de solo recordar sus lindos cabellos dorados con la brisa cuando por fin termino de pintar, orgulloso de lo bien escrito que le quedo volvió a zarpar. Estaba sucio y cansado mientras el picante sol del mediodía lo rostizaba cuando vio algo similar a un espejismo dibujándose en el puerto, justo donde se solía bajar de su barco lo vio de nuevo, tratando de ver más lejos lo noto, era el teniente Dan en su silla de ruedas saludándole - ¡es el! – grito con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja y sin pensarlo salto de barco Nado derecho a donde estaba el teniente sin fijarse en nada, llego allí como cuando un perro es llamado por su amo y este va a todas prisas… se encaramo al muelle como pudo, apenas tratando de recuperar el aliento mientras escuchaba la risa del teniente Dan que le miraba cariñosamente ladeando la cabeza - ¡Hola! – le saludo escurriendo agua completamente empapado Efectivamente era peor que un perro cuando ve regresar a su dueño, meneando la cola y ladrando entre saltitos de alegría y luego estaba su soldado favorito chapaleando en el mar, algo que Dan Taylor debía admitir, aunque le doliera el orgullo es que no había nada que le divirtiera más que ver la cara que pone el pelinegro cuando es feliz, esa mirada y ese modo de sonreír le hacían dichoso, aunque fuera un poco. no podía pasar un día sin poder verle sonreír, aunque sea un poco. - ¿Qué hace aquí? - pregunto agachándose para verle a los ojos El teniente que apenas fumaba de medio lado le miró fijamente esperando que no lo malinterpretara (o quizás eso era lo que quería) - He venido aquí, porque decidí dar \"el\" paso - Usted no tiene piernas – explicaba Forrest algo confuso - Eso ya lo sé – le renegó el ex teniente ya sacado de onda – me escribiste una carta ¿no? - Si – acepto mientras se sonrojaba de vergüenza al recordar \"todo\" lo que había escrito - Exacto – señalo mirándole con lo que parecía alegría – así que ahora eres capitán - Si señor – dijo orgulloso dedicándole una sonrisa traviesa – usted lo prometió - Y vine a cumplir mi promesa – coqueteo guiñándole el ojo – soy un hombre de palabra - Bueno – respondió Gump riendo dichoso, fue a darle la mano cerrando así el trato El teniente le apretó la mano y arrastrándole hasta que apenas si había distancia entre ellos sintiendo como le rozaba el aliento le advirtió con ese aire imponente que casi quemaba - Ni creas que te diré señor – advirtió mirándole a los ojos con rabia - Si señor – acepto Gump apenas mirando el suelo algo intimidado - ¿ese es tu barco? – señalo el barco que estaba a la deriva A la distancia se veía como un muelle era destruido por completo mientras un barco que navegaba sin pasajeros se estrellaba escandalosamente con el puerto - si ese es - respondió despreocupadamente como si eso pasara siempre. Cuando la señora Gump vio a su hijo irse de nuevo, pero no al teniente no solo disipo sus dudas si no que se sintió avergonzada de pensar mal de ambos, de malinterpretarlo todo. Su amistad no era más que eso ¿no? entonces por qué en menos de un mes ¿el teniente también se fue? Bueno puede que fuese un cariño no correspondido eso o que ella lo había mal interpretado todo desde el principio… - Hola mammá – saludo su muchacho viniendo de visita - Hola cielo ¿Cómo va el negocio? - El Teniente Dan está pescando mientras vine de visita – explico bastante cansado - ¿el Teniente Dan? – inquirió ella abriendo los ojos como platos - Si, él es el primer oficial – explico como si nada - Ya veo… ¿Por qué no lo invitas el próximo fin de semana- sugirió ella - Buenno Ahora sí que estaba convencida de los sentimientos que había entre esos dos, pero si su hijo no le decía nada al respecto ella no iba a presionarle, debía respetar sus decisiones a final de cuentas era su vida y si él prefería ir a pescar, dormir y vivir con su \"amigo\" era cosa suya, mientras la visitara de vez en cuando ella estaría bien. Cada fin de semana se aparecían por la casa, el mayor siempre era mandón y cada día más parlanchín con ella, puede que ya le tuviera algo más de confianza al no vivir bajo el mismo techo o quizás era el hecho de que ya llevaba tanto tiempo en Alabama que ya era normal verse solo los fines de semana después de ir obligado a la iglesia. Para Forrest todos los días eran divertidos, el sol y la brisa marina eran agradables y no importaba el cansancio o que les fuera muy pero muy mal en la pesca… los días eran buenos junto al Teniente Dan, como reía subiendo al mástil, como el viento lo despeinaba, incluso era gracioso cuando trataban de disimular la risa en medio de la cena en casa de su madre, mientras estaban juntos todo era color de rosa… una tarde mientras él dirigía la nave su primer oficial estaba dando órdenes a diestra y siniestra, que la brisa esto que la corriente aquello, no importaba que le tocara correr de un lado a otro siguiendo todas esas corazonadas de marino mientras Dan se viera mucho más alegre y lleno de vida de lo que lo había visto en muchísimo tiempo, el obedecería gustoso. Durante la tarde mientras buscaban, aunque sea un par de camarones entre toda la chatarra que habían atrapado en la red, el mayor bajo colgado de la polea haciendo gala de la impresionante fuerza que poseía en los brazos después de años y años de \"ejercitarlos\" - Dime ¿Dónde está tu dios? – pregunto sarcásticamente mientras le veía de reojo Forrest no chisto nada, solo le miro en silencio mientras sentía como la brisa sacudía el barco con más fuerza de la habitual. fue como si esa noche dios hubiera aparecido Forrest apenas podía sostenerse entre la cabina muriéndose de miedo con cada sacudida de las olas, el agua llovía a cantaros inundando todo a su alrededor, los truenos y relámpagos destellaban retumbando como si el mundo se fuera a acabar, apenas salió con su empapado impermeable amarillo, aferrándose a lo que sea que tuviera al lado con miedo a caerse por la borda al furioso mar, la oscuridad lo cubría todo apenas pudiendo ver con las luces de la nave - ¡estoy aquí! – se escuchaba al teniente Dan gritar a la distancia - ¡ven acá! Forrest salió a buscarlo, apenas pudiendo tenerse en pie con cada golpe de las aguas que le arrastraban con fuerza, temblando temeroso buscaba entre todo el caos a su primer oficial, le escuchaba gritar como loco, pero no le veía por ninguna parte, estaba tan asustado por la tormenta que apenas podía verle entre las violentas sacudidas de la embarcación - ¡solo somos tu y yo esta vez! – grito de nuevo mirando los rayos a la distancia Gump apenas seco un poco su rostro para poder abrir los ojos y ver como el primer oficial estaba encaramado en el mástil donde siempre solía sentarse apenas con sus pantalones puestos gritando a los cielos como poseído, enfrentándose de una vez por todas con el destino - ¡Dann! – grito como pudo - ¡es hora de arreglar cuentas! – gritaba a todo pulmón alzando su puño al oscuro cielo Con el amanecer el huracán se fue dando paso a la calma, un silencio incomparable, apenas Forrest podía mantenerse despierto, se había atado al timón del barco como un último esfuerzo para mantenerse a salvo mientras cuidaba de que Dan no se cayera perdiéndose en las oscuras aguas ahora mucho más claras entre el suave vaivén que las caracterizaba, las luces de la mañana lo cubrían todo y apenas pudo notar que había alguien sentado junto a él… - Buenos días – le saludo Dan viéndole con ternura – ¿tanto te gusta ese timón? Taylor apenas le miraba en silencio con una suave sonrisa dibujada en su rostro como en los viejos tiempos, con esa ternura protectora con la que le cuidaba desde que se conocieron - Sabes, no sé si el destino sea concreto o solo somos como una pluma en la brisa Le explicaba dulcemente mientras le desataba como si estuviese liberándole del terror que había sufrido durante toda esa noche, Gump apenas le veía ensimismado - ¿Qué tiene que ver? – pregunto confundido - Que, si el destino existe, mi destino no erra morir en batalla – concluyo mirándole Forrest apenas le miro impresionado por la calma con la que hablaba sobre Vietnam - Mi destino eras tú – rectifico señalándole con el dedo – siempre fuiste tu - ¿y-yo? – se señaló sonrojándose un poco - Mi destino era estar contigo, tú me salvaste y una y otra vez, volvías a mi sin importar nada, no importaba cual enojado estaba tu siempre estabas allí para mi… - ¿soy tu destino? – repitió amorosamente mientras miraba el mar - Eres mi destino y no sabes cuánto te agradezco eso – insistió antes de besarle la frente - Buenno – acepto abrazándole con todas sus fuerzas Sellaron todo con un suave beso mientras las primeras luces del día destellaban en el mar mientras un sol ámbar se comenzaba a alzar sobre las olas, para Gump era como si Dan hubiese hecho finalmente las paces con dios y con la vida, pero en realidad había hecho las paces consigo mismo dejando de culpar a Forrest de su infortunio, no importaban el destino que le habían impuesto o el que había escogido… ya no importaban sus miedos sobre el futuro y el dolor del pasado, ahora todo lo que les quedaba era ese presente el aquí y el ahora y ese era estar juntos incluso después de la tempestad apenas flotando en ese pequeño barco camaronero.[Chapter 5] Jenny curran bajaba del taxi justo frente a la residencia de los Gump, era igual de vieja, igual de bonita, pero había algo que no le cuadraba ¿y la gente? Recordaba ese lugar lleno de inquilinos, era de lo que vivía la señora Gump Jenny admitía el hecho de que no recordaba a su madre, pero esa señora era con ella lo más parecido a una, esa mujer era un pan de dios tan dulce y amorosa… todo lo que ella esperaba de una mamá - Bien es aquí – suspiro pesadamente mientras tomaba su diminuta maleta de viaje Llego con lo poco que poseía, la verdad se le caía la cara de la vergüenza de llegar allí sin motivo alguno, la señora Gump era su última opción y eso significaba que había agotado básicamente todas sus opciones, no tenía donde ir o a donde llegar… Sin familia o amigos solo quedaba quedarse un par de días ateniéndose al inmensa caridad y hospitalidad de la señora Gump. Suplico de corazón que él no estuviera allí, no se habían comunicado en años desde el asunto de las panteras negras y el hecho de que ella le había rechazado por enésima vez, pero eso no significaba que no pudieran verse y saludarse como en otros tiempos ¿o sí? - Es hora – murmuro ante el portón recién pintado al juzgar por el olor - ¿tú quién eres? – pregunto un hombre de temerarios ojos azul pálido - Buenos días – saludo ella rápidamente – busco a la señora Gump - Falleció hace un tiempo– explico el sujeto que le veía sentado en el banco del porche Ella se le quedo viendo, tenía el cabello bien recortado y un atuendo bastante casual y elegante a partes iguales (sin olvidar que se le hizo bastante intimidante), cualquiera diría que era un acaudalado hombre de negocios y no un vendedor ambulante que eran básicamente la mayoría de los inquilinos que frecuentaban la propiedad. El shock de la noticia le dejo sin aire ¿ahora a donde iría? No tenía con quien contar para básicamente nada, con esa trágica noticia su última esperanza se desvanecía yendo directamente al desagüe - ¿ahora la casa la maneja la señora Louis? – pregunto con un nudo en la garganta Trataba de contener el llanto, pero ya era tarde… gruesas y ardientes lagrimas corrían por sus mejillas mientras un doloroso nudo en su pecho se retorcía hasta dejarla sin voz, la sensación de perder de nuevo a su madre la invadió por completo haciéndole sollozar en silencio mientras el hombre no movía ni un musculo mirándole fijamente a la defensiva como si el supiera de antemano quien era ella \"como si viera mis pecados, mis culpas\" pensó aterrada - Señorita – le llamo chasqueando los dedos - ¿necesita algo más? - ¡Jenny! – se escuchó desde el interior de la casa Era el de todas las personas en el mundo tenía que ser Forrest Gump, ella se lo buscando yendo hasta allá, pero ¿en serio él estaba allí? eran adultos lo normal es que el viviera en otra parte, él le dijo que iría a Bayou La Batre a pescar camarones como le había prometido a su mejor amigo que había caído en batalla… pero no, él estaba allí plantado a menos de un metro viéndola con esa carita de felicidad que le estaba haciendo sentirse la peor persona del mundo por no haber venido antes, por no haber llamado nunca y peor aún por no haber asistido al funeral de la señora Gump - Hola Forrest – saludo ella enjugando sus lágrimas con afán El la aplasto envolviéndola en un enérgico y amoroso abrazo, uno que ambos necesitaban desde hace mucho más tiempo del que ambos querrían admitir - ¿Qué te paso? – pregunto angustiado al verle los ojos hinchados - Nada - ¡así que si eras Jenny! – espeto el hombre que estaba sin moverse en el banco Era la gota que había colmado el vaso, ella si apareció y todos sus miedos se volvieron realidad Forrest la veía con tanta dicha y esa inexplicable alegría en su mirar que le hizo doler el estómago de pura rabia, se mordió la lengua para no decir nada y guardar prudencia ante básicamente toda la situación, tomo su bastón y tambaleándose un poco se marchó cojeando con sus nuevas prótesis de aleación de titanio o como Forrest les decía \"sus piernas mágicas\". Le dolía admitirlo, pero había pensado tanto en que esto pasaría algún día que ya estaba más que resignado a marcharse, afortunadamente el aún era dueño de una parte de la compañía camaronera que ahora también era accionista de una empresa que era bastante fructífera, no necesitaría preocuparse por el dinero… ahora Forrest y su chica podrían vivir una bonita vida juntos, formar una familia y demás sin preocupaciones o dudas o nada malo en esa enorme casa, sin el estorbando o interfiriendo. Dan sabía perfectamente que ahora sobraba en esa casa - ¿A dónnde vas? – le pregunto Forrest mirándole confundido - A la cocina – murmuro apretando los puños para no estallar en gritos - Forrest, lamento mucho lo de tu mamá – sollozo Jenny sumamente consternada - Nno te preocupes… ¿quieres pasar? – le ofreció tomándola cálidamente de la mano - Forrest, no sé si deba… no sé si sea buena idea – se negó plantándose en la reja - ¿Por qué nno? – pregunto aún más perdido ¿Qué tenía de malo que ella se quedara? Jenny le vio con esos tristes ojos azul cielo que siempre recordaba de la niñez, ahora se veía cansada y vieja como si la vida le hubiese golpeado tanto, eso le enterneció y le hizo sentirse con la necesidad de cuidarla y protegerla, tomándola de la mano se la llevo a la casa y acomodándola en la sala noto como ella miraba por todas partes buscando algo - ¿Qué pasa? – pregunto en un tono suave y comprensivo - ¿este lugar esta solo? – estaba muy pensativa a ojos de Gump - No… estamos Dan y yo – respondió en un gesto divertido y relajado - ¿Dan? El Teniente de tus cartas ¿él no había perdido las piernas? – inquirió asombrada - Tiene piernas nuevas – rio suavemente volviendo la vista para buscarle en la cocina Ella asintió meditando lo silenciosa que era esa casa sin todo el ajetreo de sus recuerdos, se veía tan grande y acogedora, todo un hogar, aunque como cosa rara era el hogar de alguien mas - ¿él también está de visita? – se le veía curiosa – tu amigo - Él vive aquí – respondió encogiéndose de hombros - ¿vive aquí? – ella arrugo la frente algo confusa, indagando - ¿vives con alguien más? - No, la señora Louis no volvió – explicaba – ella extrañaba a Mammá… yo la extraño - Mi sentido pésame Forrest – le tomo de la mano como en los viejos tiempos - ¿Qué es Pesamme? – pregunto mirándola a los ojos con dulzura - Es complicado… ¿así que viven solo ustedes dos? – estaba más que intrigada a estas alturas – ya sabes… Dan… ¿Cuánto llevas viviendo así? - Un par de años ¿por? - estaba tan contento que no se fijaba en nada a su alrededor La rubia volvió la vista a la escalera donde se escuchaba crujir la madera del piso, efectivamente el sujeto cojeaba y caminaba bastante lento con su bastón, alguien le había ganado el puesto del caso de caridad y suspirando resignada vio de nuevo a Gump tan soñador y alegre como básicamente desde siempre, era una lástima ella debería volver a marcharse tratando de explicar que no importa cuánto le insista (dios santo era un hombre tan terco que ella no podía explicar) simplemente ella no podía amarle como a un hombre por que para ella siempre seria su amigo, su hermano y su ángel de la guarda, era difícil de explicar pero ella sentía en el alma que él siempre le cuidaría aun en la distancia, se aferraba a su recuerdo - Forrest ¿me puedo quedar un par de días? - Quédate el tiempo que quieras – ofreció con amabilidad - Gracias ¿no seré una molestia? - Para nada, Dan tendrá muchas cosas chistosas que contar, hoy volvió del condado y… Fue como si le hubieran invocado allí estaba el hombre mirándola de arriba abajo con un gesto de fastidio impresionante, no era bueno para manejar los celos y menos cuando se sabe que va a perder contra alguien que tenía años luz de ventaja - Gump - Si señor – contesto cual soldado - Me voy unos días – anuncio con una valija de viaje bastante grande - ¿Cuántos? – pregunto Forrest batiendo las pestañas - Muchos… demasiados – bufo antes de salir sin mirar atrás azotando la puerta Jenny estaba bastante impresionada por la familiaridad con la que se hablaban, cualquiera diría que esa era una escena de celos por el modo en el que él se marchó, aunque eso era tonto ¿no? Bueno ella había visto de todo y con todo se refería a todo… entonces lo noto, había un par de fotos sobre la chimenea de esos dos junto a un barco riendo como un par de tortolos enamorados, era curioso como Forrest quería a las personas las cuidaba y protegía de todo mal y peligro quizás el hombre lo había mal interpretado, quizás solo eran cosas suyas, lamento que Forrest siempre anduviera solo al final… sin saber entender el amor o quien le ame, así como el \"suele\" amar. - una lástima – susurro para sí misma - lastimma ¿de qué? Jenny – bastante extrañado solo la miraba con preocupación - ¿quieres comer algo? – sugirió ella - Estaba preparando el almuerzo cuando llegaste – asintió antes de abrir los ojos como platos con una expresión de espanto solo espeto- ¡él se fue sin almorzar! - ¿Quién? – cuestiono una vez más fuera de lugar en toda esta conversación - Dan, él se fue sin almorzar, sin despedirse, se fue… - contestaba mientras corría a la puerta Salió derecho a buscarle y pedirle que almorzara primero, siempre se quejaba de lo caro de la comida en los restaurantes (algo que Forrest no entendía si eran millonarios) y siempre hablaba de lo mucho que amaba almorzar en la meza que tenían en el patio trasero con vista al campo, pero fue cosa de que Jenny se sentara a platicar cuando ya estaba con ese equipaje saliendo sin decir nada, sintió como todo comenzaba a cobrar sentido ¿acaso lo estaba dejando? ¿sin decirle nada? Recordó que se lo había advertido ante \"esto no es para siempre\" y este era su posible ultimátum. Gump sentía que se le estaba destrozando el alma mientras caminaba apresurado rumbo a la entrada del portón donde le vio subiéndose a un taxi sin siquiera dudarlo - ¡DAN! – grito a todo pulmón, le sudaban las manos y temblaba como una hoja - ¡que! – le respondió asomándose entreabriendo la puerta del auto - ¡vas a volver! – pregunto sin disimular los nervios y el miedo a que le dijera la verdad - ¡No lo sé! – tomo aire antes de gritar lleno de ira- ¡pregúntale a tu amiguita! - ¡espera! – le llamo mientras corría al auto - ¿Por qué? – pregunto cómo en una súplica apenas en un hilito de voz con los ojos vidriosos - ¿Por qué Dan? - Eso mismo pienso yo… ¿Por qué debería estar acá? – renegó enarcando una ceja - Pero… pero… - Pero nada, decide que hacer con tu vida – ordeno amargamente – hasta luego Forrest El auto arranco apenas dejando una estela de polvo tras él, Forrest estaba petrificado tratando de procesar lo que sea que Dan le quiso decir, no pudo ni llorar… la verdad no sabía ni que pensar o hacer solo estaba allí viendo cómo se marchaba de su vida probablemente para siempre sin saber que paso. Jenny salió al porche apenas asomando los ojos por la puerta vio probablemente la escena más dramática que pudiera recordar, ni en casa blanca se despedían así, oficialmente sabía que estaba interfiriendo y hasta echando a perder lo que sea que tuvieran esos dos - Forrest – le llamo cuando lo vio congelado en el portón – almorcemos ¿sí? - Si… Efectivamente pasaron los días hasta llegar a ser semanas y Forrest ahora estaba en su mundo ideal tomando de la mano a su eternamente idealizada Jenny con ese vaporoso vestido blanco que la hacía lucir como un ángel y ese hermoso cabello ondeando con la brisa mientras paseaban junto al árbol que fue confidente de sus miles de travesuras de niños, él hablaba hasta por los codos contándole del negocio, de Vietnam y mil cosas sobre lo rara que era china, pero ella nunca decía nada solo asentía o preguntaba algún detalle en específico, pero siempre estaba ese punto incómodo \"El teniente Dan Taylor\" cuando llegaban a eso Forrest cambiaba el tema y ella se retorcía como si acabaran de mencionarle al mismísimo demonio. El silencio incomodo que se formaba en un ambiente tan tenso y pesado que los sofocaba al instante era suficiente para hacerlos volver a hacer algo más divertido como enser la tv a todo volumen o poner la radio para que todo vuelva a la normalidad para que volvieran a ser como uña y carne - Jenny – Forrest la llamo finalmente una tarde mientras ella veía por la ventana - Si - ¿tú te casarías conmigo? ¿Jenny? Ella rodo los ojos harta de volver al mismo punto \"vuelve y juega\" renegó en sus pensamientos - No deberías casarte conmigo – sugirió tratando de ser gentil - ¿tú no mme quieres? - Te quiero, pero… - P-pero - No como tú quieres, mi cariño es distinto… yo no soy para ti ¿entiendes? - ¿Qué debo entender? – pregunto bastante serio - Tu no entiendes el amor – renegó ella cruzándose de brazos - No seré muy listo ¡pero claro que si entiendo! – replico frunciendo el ceño - ¿acaso sabes lo que es el amor entre dos personas? ¿lo sabes? – inquirió frustrada - Claro que se lo que es el ammor – explicaba sombrío y algo deprimido - ¿entonces? ¿Por qué no entiendes que no te amo? – insistió agitando los brazos - ¿nunca me querrás verdad? – suspiro resignado, este era su último intento Ella le abrazo con amorosa ternura y gentileza apoyando la cabeza en su hombro acariciándolo como si fuera un niño pequeño o quizás un perro ella solo guardo silencio antes de mirarle a los ojos y con una seriedad inquebrantable le dijo - Te quiero, pero no te amo ¡por favor entiéndelo! - Buenno – respondió sin más – lo intente – dijo encogiéndose de hombros Ella soltó una leve risita antes de separarse - Lo siento Jenny – se disculpó antes de soltarla y marcharse a su cuarto Ella volvió a ver como en la tv celebraban el cuatro de julio con bombos y platillos \"de verdad que si lo intentaste\" pensó al verlo tan serio marchándose por las escaleras, una vez más tomando en cuenta todos los años que llevaban de conocerse Jenny solo pudo quedarse en silencio. Ella se quedó sola viendo la despedida del evento y una vez el canal quedo en solo estática solo pudo apagar el televisor para subir a su respectivo cuarto, esa casa era aterradora en la noche, tan grande, tan oscura y esa cantidad de cuadros y fotografías sonrientes viéndola en su soledad - Perdona por quitártelo – murmuro viendo una fotografía de Dan colgando en la escalera Era raro verle en una silla de ruedas con el cabello largo, desaliñado, con barba ¿esa no era la revista Fortune? Ella bufo incrédula al ver que hasta un retrasado mental y un minusválido tenían más éxito de lo que ella nunca pudo en años de cantar en bares e intentos fallidos como actriz, bajando la cabeza con resignación estaba más que decidida a irse a dormir como si nunca lo hubiera hecho, le gustaba hacer eso desde que llego allí, su cama era tan suave que se sentía como dormir en una nube mientras amanecía cada día con un nuevo ramo de flores sobre la mesa, mañana volverían a ir al lago donde esta noche habían visto los fuegos artificiales, fue una verdadera lástima que Forrest se pusiera nostálgico hablando de cómo eran de impresionantes en New york o como de populares eran en china mientras bailaban entre una especie de dragón - Buenas noches – susurro a una pequeña foto de la señora Gump que estaba en la mesa de noche – perdone por no querer ser su nuera En toda la noche no pudo pegar el ojo pensando en todos y cada uno de sus actos, se arrepentía de algunos, de otras cosas estaba segura que las volvería a hacer y entonces cayo en cuenta de algo, ella si llego a querer a Forrest como a un amante, pero nunca tuvo el valor de admitirlo o de aceptarlo, ahora todos esos sentimientos de la secundaria se habían esfumado con los años. Levantándose de la cama empaco todo para irse en completo silencio con las primeras luces del alba, subiéndose al taxi el metiche del conductor le pregunto \"¿de qué huyes?\" A l que ella solo negó con la cabeza y le ordeno que se fueran de allí inmediatamente - Déjeme en el cementerio de allá – señalo – espere un momento por favor - Está bien – dijo el anciano hombre mientras se estacionaba Ella toco unas monedas y compro un ramo de flores blancas para dejarlas donde estaba sepultada la señora Gump, camino dando tumbos entre todas esas lapidas parecidas entre si buscando el nombre cuando por fin pudo divisarlo a la distancia se percató de que ya había alguien llevándole un ramo enorme de rosas de un rosa pastel precioso, \"justo como las flores que ella solía llevar en sus sombreros cuando salía de casa\" recordó mirando el desolador paisaje - Disculpe – susurro plantándose al lado del sujeto que ya estaba allí Dan volvió la vista para darse la sorpresa de su vida ¿Qué hace ella aquí? ¿a estas horas? Estaba despidiéndose de la señora Gump antes de irse esa misma tarde rumbo a New york para nunca más volver a pisar el condado de Greenbow Alabama en lo que le quedara de vida, era demasiado orgulloso como para volver a la casa a despedirse o para llamar y suplicar nada, era la vida de Forrest y aunque le había jurado a esa mujer en su lecho de muerte que cuidaría de su hijo, este ya estaba lo suficientemente grandecito como para saber que hacer - ¿Qué haces aquí? – le gruño con un gesto de pocos amigos - Eso mismo digo yo – respondió ella con la misma antipatía Taylor asintió dándole otra calada a su puro, ella le revisaba de arriba abajo, estaba más delgado, tenía la barba larga y unas ojeras peores que las de ella en sus momentos más bajos, olía a licor y se veía a leguas que estaba algo ebrio, puede que él no se tomara muy bien su nueva soledad - Te extraña muchísimo – comento ella mirándole de reojo - Jajaja, si claro… - rio incrédulo sin quitar la vista de la lapida - No hay un solo día en que no te recuerde y se deprima – explico ella mirándole directamente como si lo acusara de algo - ¿Por qué no volviste? - Sabes, te reconocí apenas bajaste del taxi… me hablo tanto de ti que prácticamente recorrí medio Vietnam escuchando lo linda que eras – explicaba sin verla a los ojos - ¿y? - ¿y? ¿Cómo que, Y? – renegó ofendido – tu eres lo que el más desea en el mundo, no se puede competir con eso. Niña – insistió algo cabreado - Tu y yo sabemos que no es así… soy una parte de su vida que nunca estará completa - Jenny – le señalo – me arrebataste mi destino o por lo menos la mejor parte de mi vida y ahora me dices que no lo quieres y muchas gracias – le recrimino en un gesto de odio Ella solo asintió dándole la razón, ella era la tercera rueda y no era muy bienvenida allí, se iría ese mismo de Alabama dispuesta a no volver nunca ¿acaso estaban de acuerdo en despedirse primero de la señora Gump? Ella se quedó pensándolo un instante mientras el solo arrojaba el ramo de flores contra la tumba para dar media vuelta y marcharse - ¿A dónde vas? - Si me disculpas \"Jenny\" – contesto en un tono odioso y grosero – eso no te importa - Deberías volver a casa, de todos modos, vives allá – sugirió bastante calmada - Vivía allá, es su casa y tu su maldito amor de toda ¡LA MALDITA VIDA! - Tu si lo amas, y él te ama igual, no espera, él te ama aún más – explico ella encogiéndose de hombros – buena suerte con eso… Teniente. Dejo las flores junto a la lápida para girar sobre sus talones y marcharse tranquilamente rumbo al taxi que la recogió para irse a la estación de autobuses, Taylor se quedó plantado junto a la tumba viéndola marcharse, lo recapacito un poco, la verdad el no quería dejar Alabama, amaba el lugar, amaba el clima, pero sobre todas las cosas amaba a Forrest Gump como probablemente nunca en la vida lograría volver a amar básicamente a nadie. Le amaba en cuerpo y alma como si el mundo fuera un enorme y espantoso desierto mientras Gump sostenía una enorme jarra de fría, dulce y refrescante limonada recién hecha… - Por un demonio – refunfuño mientras se subía a un taxi rumbo a casa Forrest despertó como todas las mañanas tranquilamente escuchando el cantar de las aves y las luces del amanecer cegándole un poco, se desperezo saliendo de la cama dispuesto a dar inicio a un nuevo día, estaba algo aburrido por no decir frustrado de que Jenny siempre se negara a una vida juntos, lo medito toda la noche y llego a una conclusión que le dolía admitir en voz alta, ella no le amaba y nunca le amaría, él tampoco podría ser un buen marido, porque todo este tiempo que estaban pasando juntos el no paraba de pensar el teniente Dan, todo se lo recordaba, cuando estaba en Vietnam las estrellas en el cielo le recordaban a Jenny pero ahora cuando pensaba en Vietnam solo recordaba la lluvia y al teniente besándole la mejilla, cuando hablaba de la pesca lo recordaba encaramado en el mástil gritándole a los cielos y cuando paseaban por el campo recordaba como él se la pasaba cojeando por todos lados estrenando sus piernas. Bajo a la cocina para preparar el desayuno peor no pidió ni abrir la nevera sin ver todos esos imanes que Dan había pegado allí, sin ver las fotos de ellos en la feria riendo abrazados despreocupadamente, la comida le recordaba a él (eso le pasa por preparar su desayuno favorito), la radio estaba en su emisora preferida, justo estaba tocando su banda favorita y en las noticias hablaban de economía precisamente de las acciones de la industria camaronera… no importaba cuando fingiera que estaba bien, sentía un enorme agujero en el centro de su pecho cada vez más grande consumiéndole con su soledad, tenía ganas de correr para siempre muy muy lejos de allí - ¿Jenny? – llamo al no sentir a nadie más en casa Recorrió los cuartos encontrándolos vacíos, estaba oficialmente solo, no es que le asustara o le doliera estar completamente solo, era el hecho de que no entendía por qué lo estaba - ¿Jeeeenny? – volvió a llamar por la ventana Nada, no había nada afuera. Se sentía asfixiado entre esa casa y salió al porche para ponerse sus zapatos nuevos que Jenny le regalo pro su cumpleaños, de haber estado el teniente hubieran comido pastes y se la habrían pasado bailando toda la noche… ahora no tenía nada que hacer - Gump – escucho que le llamaban desde el portón - ¿Dan? – pregunto incrédulo de verle allí parado frente a la casa - ¿me abres? No tengo llaves – pidió amablemente con una expresión de cansancio preocupante para cualquiera – ¿sí? - ¡Dan! – le llamo mientras corría abrirle con lágrimas de alegría rodando por su rostro - ¿Qué viste un fantasma? – bromeo algo a la defensiva Se abrazaron como si nada hubiera pasado, como si no llevaran un mes sin verse y solo fuera un bueno día de toda la vida, el mayor le estampo un beso justo sobre sus lágrimas mientras Forrest solo gimoteaba tratante de contener el sentimiento de aliviada alegría que le invadía - Te extrañe, lo siento si te hice enojar – se disculpó de antemano antes de volverlo a enojar, no quería que se volviera a ir – lo siento… - gimoteo de nuevo - Shhhhh- le callo abrazándole con más fuerza – no tienes idea la falta que me hiciste Se miraron un instante, era verdad estaban hechos un desastre cuando no estaban juntos, riendo nerviosamente Dan trato de calmar el nudo en su garganta mientras sus ojos se aguaban en lágrimas que batallaba por contener, Gump por otro lado le beso con fuerza mientras lloraba a moco tendido, susurrando pequeñas disculpas valla a saber que había hecho mal, pero por si acaso ¿no? - Te voy a advertir una cosa – le freno en seco - ¿Qué? – pregunto aterrado ante la seriedad del ex teniente Taylor - Nunca, jamás en la vida, te repito NUNCA. Me dejes marcharme así otra vez, si… si tienes que quitarme las prótesis hazlo, pero detenme - ¿Qué? ¿de qué mme hablas? – ahora si estaba confundido ¿de qué habla? - Porque si me vuelvo a alejar de ti sé que moriré – exclamaba más que convencido de ello – te amo, te amo demasiado y no sé ya lo que es vivir sin ti… - Yo lo ammo, yo lo amo mmuchisimo Teniente Dan – respondió sonrojándose violentamente entre el llanto y las sonrisas de dicha - ¿hace cuánto no me dices así? – indago algo divertido - Nno importa- le abrazo de nuevo ocultando su rostro contra su pecho – te amo Entraron a casa para desayunar riendo con timidez y nerviosismo, tratando de volver a recobrar la compostura a recuperar lo que tenían allí, Dan le veía fijamente como si tratara de memorizar cada detalle de su rostro mientras le tomaba la mano de vez en cuando - Sabes – le dijo finalmente - Si – respondió sonrojándose al sentirse de nuevo amado - Te debo un pastel de cumpleaños, comprémoslo luego ¿sí? - Si Asintió para darle un casto beso en los labios y seguir comiendo fingiendo que nada había pasado. En cuanto a Jenny bueno, ella volvió a cantar y hasta logro grabar un disco de country, tenía un trabajo de medio tiempo y hasta volvió a tratarse con una de sus tías por parte de su madre puede que las cosas le fueran bien después de todo, aunque nunca volvió a pasarse por Alabama, al final del día ella entendía después de todo y se alegraba por Forrest, al menos el sí tenía quien lo amara. ","Summary":" Sé que esta pareja está muy rebuscada y esta historia creo que ya nadie la recuerda, pero el otro d"},{"Movie":"Now You See It...","Title":"Danny in Hiding","Author":"Rainforest Treefrog","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726634","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One I can't go on like this , thought Danny Sinclair. I've been in hiding for over two years now and still no sign of Max. Ever since the night of the finale of the reality show: World's Greatest Kid Magician, Danny had basically fallen off the side of the Earth. Not literally of course, but he had changed his identity, and escaped the country. The reality show had been in New Orleans, and as soon as he made Max disappear as a part of his act, Alyson had helped him board the first train out of Louisiana. It went strait to San Francisco, with a short stop to get fuel in Denver. Alyson was the only kid who knew about the whereabouts of Danny. Of course, Max, being the clever jerk he was, eventually found out that Danny was in California, so Danny was on the move yet again. This time out of the country, to France. So now, here Danny was waiting for something to happen, in his small apartment in Paris. Danny practically jumped ten feet high out of his seat when he heard the knocking on the door. \"Who is it,\" he asked nervously. \"Calm down Danny, it's Alyson.\" \"Oh, Alyson, thank goodness it's you.\" He opened the door to see Alyson's bright smile and beautiful face. He hated to admit, but he was beginning to develop a big crush on her. \"I like your place,\" Alyson commented as Danny led her into the apartment. Looking out the window, she could see the Eiffel Tower, across the Seine River. \"Nice view!\" \"Uh, thanks,\" Danny answered, a bit awkwardly. \"So how do you like it in Paris?\" \"It's amazing! I've always dreamed of coming here as a child. I never realized everything was so…beautiful here. And big too, I mean the Eiffel Tower is so much bigger than it looks like in those post cards you sent me when you first moved here, and Notre Dame is spectacular too, with the gargoyles and all.\" Danny nodded. \"Anyway, have you heard anything?\" \"Heard anything about…what?\" \"You know Max, is he still trying to come after me?\" \"Well, duh. You know he is. But you've got to stop hiding like this dude. Sooner or later the time will come when you have to face Max. Don't worry, if you master your magic, then you will totally be able to kick his butt!\" Danny didn't answer. \"What's wrong?\" Still no answer. \"Danny, Max is here in Paris.\" \"WHAT! Crap! That means I have to move to India now!\" Alyson burst out laughing. \"See man, you're paranoid. You need to lighten up.\" \"Easy for you to say, you aren't the one being stalked by a wizard maniac!\" \"So,\" Alyson said, this time more seriously, \"what do you have new to show me?\" \"Well, there is this cool new trick I learned from this sweet book that let's me turn into an animal.\" \"Ok,\" Alyson said, \"let's see it.\" Danny nodded and began to concentrate really hard on something. Then, he took a deep breath and whispered some magic spell to himself. Suddenly, in a puff of smoke he transformed from his human form to that of a pigeon. \"Great,\" said Alyson laughing again, \"but how is turning into a dumb bird going to help you defeat Max?\" \"It isn't,\" Danny the pigeon squawked. \"This was a mistake. I meant to turn into an owl.\" The pigeon turned back into Danny, who was scratching his head in a confused manor. \"What did I do wrong, I've done that trick almost twenty times by now.\" \"Well, it obviously isn't going to get you anywhere,\" Alyson said. \"Why do you want to turn into animals anyway?\" \"Well, for one thing, it's pretty fun. And for another thing, if I turned into a tiger or a bear or something, I could kill Max.\" \"Well, I wouldn't bet on something like that,\" suggested Alyson. \"If you want my opinion, and I know you do so don't deny it, I seriously think that you need to come up with some more tricks up your sleeve. Meanwhile, I brought my camcorder, and I want to get some cool shots of this city.\" \"Really,\" asked Danny. \"I thought after our reality show with Max, you decided the show business wasn't for you anymore.\" \"Nah, I love what I do,\" Alyson said. \"I'm trying to get this cool new job at a reality show in Miami.\" Danny shrugged. Whatever floats her boat I guess? Meanwhile, I need to find some way to defeat Max. It won't be long before he discovers me…[Chapter 2] Chapter Two \"Danny,\" asked Alyson, yawning. It was 10:00 AM and Alyson had just gotten up. \"Danny are you their?\" There was no answer, so Alyson walked into the kitchen, expecting to see him there gorging on cereal or something. But, he was no where to be found, even after she searched the entire apartment. That's when Alyson found a note on the refrigerator. It read: Alyson, I went to the library this morning but didn't want to wake you up. When you have awoken and gotten something to eat, meet me there. Go north for two blocks, take a right, and down the avenue with the big red trees. The library is across the street from there. Alyson had to admit that she would rather be sightseeing today instead of spending time in a library, but if she had to admit that she enjoyed a good puzzle, and had a feeling that there was bound to be a puzzle waiting to be solved there. After quickly gulping down a glass of orange juice and some raisin toast, Alison left the apartment, clutching the note in her hands, following the directions. She walked past a beautiful green park, with a lake and fountain. Swans, ducks and geese were lazily floating in it, and there was a huge flock, sorry wrong word, SWARM, of pigeons. \"Ok, follow the avenue with the big red trees,\" Alyson said to herself, glancing at the notes sketched onto the piece of paper. Well, there was an avenue with big trees, but all the leaves had fallen off. This must be it, Alyson reasoned. Even though all the leaves were gone, it was late November, the time when the leaves fall in Paris. Danny must have meant that the trees had red leaves before they fell. Alyson continued down the avenue, until she came to a bridge over the Seine river. Across the river, Alyson could see a large building with a large sign in French. In English, it translated to Paris Central Library. This must be it , Alyson thought, excited that she could figure out maps and directions even in foreign countries. Sure enough, she found Danny inside, in the Fantasy Literature section, his nose buried in a mountain of books. He was so absorbed in whatever he was reading that he didn't notice Alyson until she walked right over to him and tapped on the shoulder. When this happened, Danny nearly jumped 10 feet all over again. \"Man, you SCARED me!\" he said, panting a little. \"Sorry, I just keep thinking that everyone and everything is Max lately.\" \"Well, it's just me, so no need to have a heart attack,\" said Alyson laughing a little. \"So, what are you doing here that you think will help you to defeat Max?\" \"Well, I've done a lot of research, and Paris has had a long history of wizards and witches. I've been searching through biographies to see if I can learn anything from any of them.\" \"Any luck?\" \"Well, there was this interesting gypsy named Angela VanNest,\" Danny replied. \"Apparently, she created a whole bunch of magic potions. They can do anything from make you become invisible, change your identity (meaning you would turn into the body of a different person), let you fly, or even walk through walls. All of these spells are supposedly in a giant spell book called Angela's Guide to Witchcraft . Unfortunately, I can't find the book and I've searched this entire section of the library. \"Well, it is a BIG library,\" Alyson reminded him. \"I mean look, this library probably has MILLIONS of books. If Angela's Guide to Witchcraft still exists, I'm sure it is in here.\" \"Well, good look finding it,\" Danny said tiredly, \"I've been searching almost all morning.\" \"Ok, well first let me see the book that mentions this Angela VanNest person,\" Alyson suggested. \"Ok,\" said Danny, \"but could you please tell what you are going to do?\" This was typical. Danny was the magician, and Alyson was the puzzle solver. Alyson could never completely understand why Danny had so many problems with his magic, and Danny could never figure out what Alyson was trying to solve. This was basically the only misunderstanding between the two of them, but it had started arguments in the past. Not wanting to start a dumb argument, Alyson told him. \"Look at this picture of Angela,\" she told him. \"See how she's wearing that weird necklace with the shapes on them?\" \"Yah, so,\" was Danny's reply. \"Well, I'll bet you this is just like that time at the library in the Magic Mansion, when the snakes on the binding pointed to Max's secret sanctum. But instead, I bet the symbols in Angela's necklace tell the location of her book in this library.\" \"Alyson, you might be right!\" Danny said. \"It's good to know that my best friend is a total puzzle queen!\" \"Oh, come on, anyone could figure it out,\" Alyson said, being modest. \"Ok, Alyson, so what do these symbols mean?\" Danny asked. \"Well,\" Alyson said, studying them carefully, \"they look like numbers in Greek.\" \"You speak GREEK?\" Danny asked, astounded. \"Well, I picked up a little when I spent last summer in Athens for the study abroad program,\" Alyson admitted, \"but I'm not really fluent.\" \"Ok, well what numbers are they?\" Danny asked. \"I'll write them down.\" \"Ok, great. Let's see, the first one is a … um… I think that is an eighty-two. And the next one is defiantly a four.\" \"Eighty-two, four, ok, got it,\" Danny said. \"Wait, I'm not done,\" Alyson reminded him. \"Ok, just two more numbers. It looks like a twenty-one and a … um … two? Yah, two!\" \"Sweet, so now we have the numbers, what now?\" asked Danny. \"Now, we find where this is in the library,\" Alyson told him. \"Let's find a librarian or something. They should know where eighty-two, four, twenty-one, two is,\" Danny suggested. \"Ok, good idea,\" Alyson agreed. There was a librarian, who was in about in her mid-twenties sitting behind a desk near their section of the library. She had long brown hair and didn't seem to be busy, so Danny and Alyson went up to her. \"Excuse me, um … Destimona?\" Alyson said reading the name plate on the librarian's jacket. The librarian looked up from the copy of Guardians of Ga'hoole that she was reading. \"Yes, may I help you?\" she asked. \"We were wondering where we could find this section of the library,\" Alyson explained. \"Do you happen to know where eighty-two, four, twenty-one, two is?\" \"As a matter of fact I do,\" Destimona the librarian answered. \"But that is the restricted section of the library. I'm sorry, you can't go there.\" \"Um, we kind of need to, REALLY badly,\" Danny complained. \"Are you sure you can't just make an exception just this once.\" Destimona stared long and hard at both Alyson and Danny. \"I don't think you look like bad kids, so I'll make an exception just the once,\" she said. \"Follow me.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter Three \"You'd better realize how lucky you two are,\" Destimona said as she led Danny an Alyson up a long flight of stairs to the \"restricted\" section of the library. \"Besides myself and the other librarians here, few people have been allowed up here.\" While the librarian was giving her monologue, Alyson noticed that she didn't have the least bit of a French accent. In fact, whenever she tried to speak any of the French words written randomly on the walls here and there, she totally slaughtered the pronunciation. \"Just a question,\" Alyson said, \"but where are you from? I mean you obviously aren't from France, and you sort of have a Southern accent.\" Destimona didn't answer. That's strange, Alyson thought , all I asked was where she was from. She acted like I asked something extremely private and personal. Finally, Destimona led the two kids to a room that said Room # 82-4. \"That's it,\" said Alyson excitedly. \"Those are the numbers! Well, half of them anyway, but hey it's a start! See, Danny, I knew we would be able to find your magic book.\" \"What magic book,\" Destimona asked, curiously. \"Oh, just something me and Danny have been looking for,\" Alyson said. Destimona looked as if she wanted to know more, but she didn't ask any further questions, and Alyson and Danny didn't give her any answers. Destimona opened the door, and it creaked slowly when she pushed it. \"Wow, this section of the library is kind of spooky!\" Alyson commented. Destimona gave a little sniff when Alyson said this, and quietly followed them into the dark room. \"There's no light here,\" Alyson observed. \"What are we going to use for light?\" \"These,\" Destimona replied, pulling out some candles from a nearby shelf and lighting them. She gave one to Danny, one to Alyson and kept one for herself. \"Reminds me of our days in the Magic Mansion,\" said Danny to Alyson as they began to search the book shelfs, which by the way were old and covered with dust and cobwebs. \"I know,\" Alyson agreed. \"I can still remember that day when me, you, and Cedric discovered Max's secret room and vault. Remember how scared Cedric was?\" Danny nodded, smiling. \"Hey I think this is what we're looking for,\" Alyson said. \"Look, shelf #21. Now we just need to find book #2. Aha! Here it is! Danny we've found it!\" Alyson pulled out a book that seemed like it was a thousand years old. The cover was worn and covered with dust, yet the faint words Angela's Guide to Witchcraft were still visible. Alyson blew the dust off and open to the first page. The pages were far beyond yellowed. They were such a dark golden brown color that it was hard to read the words on the pages. But it was the book they were looking for, and that was all that mattered at the moment. \"Alyson you are a genius!\" Danny congratulated her. \"And now, back to the apartment to study up on this stuff.\" \"Right!\" \"You'll have to check the book out first, don't forget,\" Destimona reminded them. Danny and Alyson were so excited about their discovery, that they had forgotten that the young librarian was still there. \"Right, sorry we forgot,\" Alyson said laughing a little. \"This looks like an interesting book,\" Destimona commented as she stamped the due date in the book's date sheet. She was staring at it like it was some magical diamond or something. \"Uh, dudette, are you OK?\" Danny asked, breaking her out of her strange trance. \"Oh, what? Oh, yah … I'm … fine.\" \"Ok, just making sure, you seemed kind out of it,\" Danny replied. \"Anyway, thanks for taking us to that part of the library. We really appreciate it.\" \"Don't mention it,\" Destimona replied sheepishly. \"Ok, Danny, let's go,\" Alyson said. \"Thanks again Destimona.\" Danny and Alyson left the weird librarian sitting there, as they walked back to Danny's apartment. \"It's a good thing that she gave us the book,\" Alyson said as they walked past the park with lake and multitude of pigeons, \"but didn't she seem sort of weird to you?\" \"Yah, but I wouldn't worry about it,\" Danny said. \"Coming from Mr. Oh my gosh Max is here I have to move to India,\" Alyson joked. \"It's good to know you aren't freaking out as much as you were yesterday when I arrived.\" \"Yah,\" Danny said in a nervous voice, \"but I'm still worried. Max is still out there. We have to be careful.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter Four Weeks passed since the discovery at the library and all that Danny had done during that entire time was study like there was no tomorrow. \"Seriously Danny, don't you think you should take a break from all that and come do something?\" Alyson asked. \"I'm worried about you. You need to get a life.\" \"Alyson, this is extremely important. When Max comes, I HAVE to be ready for him. I got him once, but that doesn't mean I can do it again. I have to master my magic in order to do that.\" Alyson shrugged. \"Well, I'm going to the Louvre today. That's where the original Mona Lisa is you know. Are you sure you don't want to come, you know for just a short break or something?\" \"I'm sure,\" Danny replied, not even looking up at Alyson. \"Well, fine, I'll be back tonight.\" With that, Alyson left. \"Thank goodness I can have some peace and quiet now,\" Danny muttered to himself. \"Now where was I?\" Danny had been reading up the entire day on invisibility spells and also teleportation spells. So far, he had been practicing the invisibility spell. The words to it were simple: universe hide me now…remove the sight of me from human eye…keep me safe from the eye of death. However, it wasn't reciting the spell that was so hard. It was concentrating hard enough to actually make it work that was hard. Even Danny found this to be difficult. Ok, this time it will work , Danny thought as he recited the spell once more. Unfortunately, all Danny succeeded in doing was becoming transparent, like a ghost, but not completely invisible. \"This is ridiculous!\" Danny yelled out in frustration, hurling the book of spells at the wall. \"This is the FIFTH time I've tried ALL day! How hard can it be?\" Meanwhile, Alyson was exploring the halls and corridors of the Louvre museum. She had just seen the Mona Lisa and most of the other famous art pieces, so now she was exploring the rest of the museum. She was about to leave, when a familiar voice caught her attention. Who could that be? she wondered. She followed the sound into a large gallery full of paintings from the late eighteenth century. The man she had heard speaking was wearing a trench coat, fedora, and sunglasses, as if he didn't want to betray his identity. \"I knew that man very well,\" he was saying to one of the tour guides for the museum. \"In fact, you could even say that he was like a mentor to me.\" Why does he sound so familiar? Alyson wondered. Suddenly, the man noticed Alyson looking at him. He gave her a long stair. Who is he? Alyson kept asking herself. She knew she knew. And why is giving me such a strange look? Then, without warning, the man turned and fled. \"Uh … monsieur?\" the tour guide asked bewildered. \"Where are you going?\" Alyson rushed over into the gallery and glanced at the portrait the familiar man had been staring at. It was a portrait of deMilo! Suddenly, it hit Alyson like a rocket! It was Max! Max was the man in the trench coat! He had been staring at the portrait and talking about the person in it as if he knew him because Antonio deMilo had been his mentor who he had killed! \"I can't believe it!\" Alyson cried. \"I knew I knew who that was! How could I have been so stupid?! It's Max! He's actually in Paris! He must know that Danny is hiding here and now that he saw me here, he's probably positive about it!\" The tour guide was looking at her bug eyed. \"Como ca va?\" he asked. (are you ok?) Yes I'm fine, Alyson wanted to shriek at him. But no time for that. I've GOT to find Danny and warn him that he's not safe anymore! It was late afternoon by the time Alyson made it back to the apartment. As fast as she ran, it seemed that there was always something to slow her down. It was rush hour and the trains, taxis and subways of Paris had all been busy. \"DANNY,\" she practically exploded as she flung open the door to the apartment and burst inside. \"Danny, I've got bad news!\" \"What's up,\" came Danny's voice from somewhere. \"Danny, this is no time for games, I've got important news to tell you!\" \"I'm right here,\" the Danny's voice said again. Strangely, it seemed as if he was standing right next to her, but Alyson couldn't see him anywhere. \"It's the invisibility spell,\" Danny explained. \"After practicing almost the entire afternoon, I've finally gotten it to work. Cool, right?\" \"Yah, cool,\" Alyson said, barely paying attention. \"Listen Danny, you're not going to like this. Today, when I was at the Louvre, I saw Max.\" \"Nice one Alyson, but I'm not as gullible as you think. You already pulled that one on me, and I'm not falling for it again.\" \"No Danny, this is serious this time. Look, I know what I saw. Max is here, in Paris. You've got to believe me.\" \"WHAT?!\" Danny cried. Alyson's words finally seemed to register. \"Well, what are we going to do? I'm still not prepared to face Max. I'm still weak Alyson, don't you get it? I can't fight him! We have to move somewhere else. Um … where do you think? Spain? … India? … Russia? Come on what should we do. You're the puzzle solver. What do you think?\" \"No, Danny, no more running away. Whether you're ready or not, it's time for you to face Max. Maybe a few more days, yah, but I have faith that you can do it. Trust me on this.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter Five My cover is blown! Max cursed. He'd been tracking Danny all the way across the globe, from New Orleans, to San Francisco, and now to Paris. What were the odds that in this enormous city, he would run into Alyson and spoil everything? Now she will probably go alert Danny, and the two of them will be in New Zealand by the time I get a chance to do anything. Max was lounging in a café near the Louvre, trying to come up with something. He hadn't come all the way to Europe for nothing. There had to be a way to destroy Danny for good. Suddenly, a poet reading her latest work on the café's stage caught Max's attention. Poetry? ... OF COURSE! Max thought. The library! Somehow I will be able to find out something there. Moments later, the evil sorcerer was walking in the doors of the Paris Central Library, where Danny and Alyson had discovered the spell book, only two weeks ago. \"Father,\" a familiar voice asked when Max stepped in. It was Destimona, one of librarians. \"Oh, Destimona, my daughter!\" Max said smiling, forgetting his mission for a few brief moments. \"It's good to see you, my lovely.\" \"Good to see you to, father,\" Destimona agreed. \"What brings you to Paris?\" \"I'm looking for Danny Sinclair,\" Max replied. \"And I'm pretty sure that his little girlfriend Alyson is with him.\" \"Danny Sinclair?\" Destimona asked a bit puzzled. \"You mean the kid from your reality show a few years back?\" \"Yes, that's the one,\" Max replied, with resentment in his voice. \"I've been trying to find him ever since the final performance.\" \"Wait a minute,\" Destimona said. \"I do remember a familiar somebody coming into the library about two weeks ago. I recognized him from your reality show. He was fairly tall, brown hair, kind of moody, with a blond chick. They wanted to go to the restricted section of the library, and checked out a book on spells by some gypsy chick.\" \"Are you sure?!\" Max asked, intently. \"I think that could be Danny!\" \"I bet it was,\" Destimona replied, \"And the blond chick, kept talking about how much she enjoyed puzzles.\" \"That would be Alyson!\" Max agreed. \"That's got to be them. Do you have any additional information about them, you know, there whereabouts and stuff like that?\" \"Afraid not,\" Destimona replied. \"But don't despair, they haven't returned the book yet. The due date is later this afternoon in fact, at four o'clock.\" \"Good idea!\" Max said smiling. \"When they come, we'll be waiting. And then, I will do what I should have done when I first met Danny: DESTROY him.\" Destimona cackled wickedly. \"I like this evil side of you, daddy.\" \"It's always been there,\" Max replied. \"I just never knew you had an evil side too.\" Meanwhile, back at Danny's apartment, Danny and Alyson were cramming the remaining information from the spell book as quickly as possible. \"It's been two weeks, and I can only accomplish three spells from this stupid book!\" Danny grumbled in frustration. \"How am I going to face Max when I can only turn invisible, turn into an animal, and levitate stuff? I'm not even that good at any of these spells as it is.\" \"That's not you're only problem,\" Alyson reminded him. \"The book is due TODAY!\" \"Could things get any worse?\" Danny cried in frustration. \"I wish there was some way for me to learn all of these spells right this instant, and be good at them too.\" \"We've got an hour left, so don't panic, yet,\" Alyson said, trying to remain calm and rational. \"It's three o'clock.\" But unfortunately, the hour passed, and all the progress that Danny had made was turning himself into a turkey. \"Wow, poultry is so scary!\" Alyson said sarcastically. \"Seriously Danny, I know you can do better than this. You're probably just letting your nerves get the best of you.\" \"Easy for you to say,\" Danny retorted, \"I have a freaking psychopath just waiting to kill me and eat my flesh.\" \"Well, I'm pretty sure that Max isn't a cannibal, but I get what you're saying,\" Alyson said, apologizing for her outburst. \"Just remember, you still have me for support.\" \"Thanks Alyson,\" Danny said, forcing a smile. \"I'm just so stressed.\" \"Ok, well, we'll go right now and drop the book off at the library, then come back and practice the spells you do know. Who knows? They might be exactly what you need to defeat Max for good.\" Danny agreed, and the two of them left the apartment, toward the library, clutching the book tightly. Little did they know what lay ahead for them.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six \"Strange,\" Danny muttered as he and Alyson approached the library. \"There are almost no cars or bikes parked in the parking lot. That's weird.\" \"For sure,\" Alyson agreed, scanning the area for people. There was no one to be found. \"Maybe it's a holiday?\" \"What holiday?\" Danny asked. \"Christmas is over, Bastille Day isn't for several months in France, Halloween isn't celebrated here, and it's not Easter either.\" \"Well, the library doesn't close until six o'clock, and you HAVE to turn in the book, so let's just go,\" Alyson said. However, when they got inside the library, they found that it was completely empty, and most of the lights were turned off. There were only a few lit candles here and there, to illuminate the building. Strangely, there didn't appear to be any librarians on duty either. \"Something doesn't seem right here,\" Danny muttered. \"Let's just fine the drop off box, and get out of here. I'm getting creeped out!\" \"Totally,\" Alyson agreed. Quickly, he and Alyson shoved the book into the slot in the large box next to the head librarian's desk and made way for the door. But when they tried to open it, it wouldn't budge! \"What's wrong with this stupid thing?!\" panicked Danny cried. \"I'm telling you Alyson, something is SERIOUSLY wrong here!\" \"You're right, something isn't right,\" said a voice that was somewhat familiar. Danny and Alyson and whirled around to see Destimona, the librarian step out of the shadows. She had a strange, smug smile on her face, as though she knew something that Danny and Alyson didn't. \"I always knew you were a creeper,\" Alyson shouted. \"Let us OUT of this library. We returned the stupid book, so just let us go in peace, OK?\" \"I'm afraid she can't do that,\" said another voice, this one deep and raspy, like an old man… \"Max!\" Danny and Alyson both cried simultaneously. \"I'm glad you remember me,\" Max said stepping out of the shadows and standing next to Destimona. He too had a wicked grin on his face. \"I've been waiting for this moment ever since the final performance. Only this time, there's no way out.\" Max laughed as he said this. \"You'll never take Danny's powers!\" Alyson shouted angrily at Max. \"You have no right to them! They belong to Danny and Danny alone!\" \"Just because I'm not entitled to them doesn't mean that I can't get them,\" Max replied. \"And believe me, before this is over, they WILL be mine.\" \"Not if you can't catch us Max!\" Danny shouted. \"Come on Alyson, we're out of here!\" Danny grabbed Alyson by the wrist, and dragged her along with him. The two of them sprinted up the nearest staircase. Max just chuckled. \"You think you can escape me? Well, think again. Running won't save you. Not this time.\" \"Danny, why are we doing this?\" Alyson asked as they ran down a long hallway. \"You heard what Max said, running won't save us. You need to stand up to him. This is what your two years of hiding was all about: getting stronger and more powerful, so you would finally be able to defeat Max. This is it!\" \"I know, I know,\" Danny replied. \"This is just to buy time. I need to figure out what I'm going to do first.\" \"Ok, then let's hide in that room over there,\" Alyson suggested. She was pointing to a door behind some bookshelves. \"Max will never think to check there.\" \"Oh, yes he will,\" Danny replied, \"it might take a little while, but he'll find us eventually, trust me. Have you learned nothing about Max through all of this? If he could track us all the way to Paris, France, I'm pretty sure he could find us in a public library, even one as gigantic as this.\" \"It's to buy time,\" Alyson answered, quoting Danny's earlier excuse for running away. \"Fine.\" The two of them crowded inside the room, which was actually a closet. \"Ok, first things first,\" Alyson whispered. \"Let's think of all the tricks and spells you can use against Max.\" \"Like I said,\" Danny immediately answered, \"I haven't had enough time for this. All I can do is change into animals, levitate stuff, and turn invisible.\" \"You can do more than that,\" Alyson said, joking a little. \"You can create snow inside fish tanks, like you did in the reality show. What else, you can make fake elephants disappear and then reappear on mechanical bulls.\" \"Ok, Alyson, enough joking around,\" Danny shot back. \"This is serious. Those lame tricks from the past aren't going to help either of us get out of this.\" \"Ok,\" Alyson said. \"Well, what can you do with these three spells? Let's see, how is changing into animals going to help us? Wait a minute … I have think I have an idea! Danny, can you only change yourself into animals? Because what I you could change Max into something? You know, transform him and Destimona into little butterflies?\" \"I like your thinking,\" Danny said, rubbing his chin as he pondered the idea. Suddenly, Danny and Alyson heard footsteps coming from outside of the closet. They sounded close. They could here the voices of Max and Destimona also. \"Well, well,\" said Max on the other side of the door. \"Who do we have in here?\" He knocked on the closet door. \"Anybody in here?\" Then he flung it open, shouting, \"Peek-a-boo!\" Danny and Alyson both screamed. \"Back off Max,\" Danny shouted, trying to sound fiercer than he felt. The truth was, it felt as though his insides had turned into chocolate pudding or jell-o or something. \"Or what?\" Max said, laughing again. What was with his creepy laugh? \"Or I'll turn you and Destimona both into… uh… PIGEONS!\" Max and Destimona both burst out laughing. \"You want a bet?\" Danny asked, trying to sound confident. \"I'll do it, watch!\" Max stopped laughing and suddenly looked very grave and serious. \"I'm watching,\" he said, his voice cold, like stone. Max, Destimona, and Alyson watched as Danny closed his eyes and concentrated very hard on something. He muttered a spell to himself, and then POOF! Destimona was transformed just like that into a bird! Danny opened his eyes, and when he saw what he had done, a smile crept over his face. \"I… I did it! Alyson look, I did it! For once, my magic actually did what I wanted it to! This is great!\" Destimona just sat there squawking. \"Father do something!\" she shrieked. Max was flabbergasted. He just stared at the pigeon waddling around on the ground. He simply couldn't believe two things. First, that his daughter was now a bird, and two that Danny was the reason for this. He turned his gaze to the young wizard. \"DANNY!\" he roared. \"Change my daughter back NOW!\" \"I refuse to do that sir,\" Danny replied, this time his voice calm and cool. After the feet he had just achieved, all fear of Max was gone. He now saw Max as his equal, someone he could stand up against. \"I'll only do that if you swear to leave me and Alyson in peace from now on.\" Max was outraged. \"I REFUSE TO THAT TOO! Listen to ME Danny, if you don't change my daughter back right now, I'll… I'll… I'LL DESTROY YOU FOR GOOD!\" \"You were already going to do that anyway,\" Danny replied. \"And if you really do that, then how do you expect for Destimona to ever be a human again, huh? Remember, the only wizard who can undo a spell, is the one who cast it. In this case to me. Whether you like it or not, I have power over you now.\" Max didn't reply. Instead, he stared at Danny for a few moments, giving him the meanest glare imaginable. Then, without warning, he darted forward, and grabbed Alyson by the arm, pulling her toward him. He grabbed a knife and held it to her throat. \"Listen to ME, Danny,\" Max said, calm again, and with disgusting smile on his face, \"if you don't turn back my daughter, AND, give me your powers, I promise you that you're little girlfriend Alyson will DIE!\" Danny was completely taken aback. \"What… you can't…\" \"Danny, help me!\" Alyson was shrieking. \"You can do this! Defeat Max! Please Danny, believe in yourself, this is the only way that we'll get out of this!\" \"Shut up,\" Max ordered Alyson, holding her tighter, and holding the knife dangerously close to her throat. He looked again at Danny, as if waiting for an answer. \"Tell you what,\" he said slyly, \"I'll give you a little time to think about this. When you've decided what you want to do, you'll know exactly where to find me. And remember, if you don't agree to terms, Alyson will be even deader than King Tut.\" With that, Max, along with Alyson disappeared in a puff a smoke, leaving Danny alone in the library chamber, with the dumb talking pigeon Destimona. I can't believe it , Danny thought. What the heck am I supposed to do now? My best friend is on death row because of me, and I'm forced between her or my powers. Danny knew that he would never compromise Alyson for his magic, but there had to be a way to get her and his magic back, without any blood and death… \"Are you going to change me back or what?\" Destimona asked. \"SHUT UP!\" Danny roared at the bird, kicking it across the room. With that, he left the library to buy a birdcage to stuff her in, and to outwit Max.[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven High above Paris, Alyson lay captive to the evil sorcerer Max. He had locked her in a metal wire cage, at the top of the Eiffel Tower. \"So this is your brilliant plan, Max?\" Alyson asked. \"Lock me up at the top of the Eiffel Tower? Don't you think that's a little obvious? You know Danny is going to check here, don't you?\" Max smiled. And it wasn't a kind smile either. It was Max's signature creeper smile. The one he gave whenever he knew he was about to succeed in doing something terrible. \"Don't worry Alyson. I've got everything under control,\" he cackled wickedly. \"I already know Danny will suspect this place, I'm not worried about that. The question is, how is he going to get all the way up here? You see, I've frozen the elevators, so they're out of commission, and I've also blocked the staircases. There will be no possible way for him to get up here.\" \"What about all of the tourists that want to come and see the Eiffel Tower?\" Alyson questioned. \"What are you going to do about that?\" \"I've gotten that taken care of that too,\" Max replied, still smiling. \"I've posted a fake sign saying that the tower is closed until further notice. Face it Alyson, there is no possible way that Danny is going to save you, and keep his powers. You see, in the end, I always win. I won against Antonio deMilo, and I'm about win against Danny Sinclair.\" \"You are such a bizarre creeper,\" Alyson muttered in disgust. Please Danny, find a way to make everything ok again, she thought. She sat back down and leaned against the cage. It wasn't until then, when she felt something in her back pocket, that she remembered that she had something very important with her. Her CELL phone! I have a feeling my texting skills are about to become very useful, Alyson thought. Meanwhile, back at the apartment, Danny was desperately trying to come up with a plan to save Alyson and keep his powers at the same time. \"I can't believe I've been blackmailed by Max,\" Danny shouted angrily as he paced around the kitchen. \"Well, believe it,\" said Destimona, from her birdcage. \"SHUT UP!\" Danny roared at her. \"Stupid bird! This is all YOUR fault. You led Max right to Alyson and I! \"Hey, Max is my dad,\" Destimona said in self-defense. \"What was I supposed to do?\" \"In case you haven't noticed,\" Danny countered, \"your dad is a total FREAK! He's a MANIAC! Don't you get it? He tried to kill me once, and now he's threatening to kill Alyson unless I hand over you and my powers.\" Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. \"What the heck?\" Danny muttered in frustration. \"Who's there?\" \"It's me,\" said the voice behind the door. \"Me who ?\" There was no answer, so Danny walked over to the door and peeked into the peephole. It was a red head kid, with huge glasses and freckles. He seemed strangely familiar. Cedric? \"Cedric, is that you,\" Danny asked, flinging the door open in surprise. \"The one and only,\" he replied, smiling. Cedric had been Danny and Alyson's camera operator back in New Orleans during the reality show: Search for the World's Greatest Kid Magician. He hadn't changed a bit. \"Um, glad to see you,\" Danny said, surprised to see the kid. \"How did you get here? I mean, how did you find me? The only person who knew I was here was Alyson and now Max of course.\" \"I was on vacation in Spain,\" Cedric replied. \"We have villa on the beach, just outside of Barcelona, and we go there every year. So, earlier today I received a text message from Alyson. She said that she was being held hostage on top of the Eiffel Tower, and that Max was blackmailing you. So, I boarded the fastest train from Barcelona to Paris, and now here I am, ready to help.\" \"Trains these days go that fast?\" Danny asked. \"You'd be surprised man.\" Cedric replied. \"So how are you going to help,\" Danny asked, glancing out the apartment window, which had a view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance. I can't believe that's where Alyson is right now, he thought. \"Turns out I'm going to be a big help,\" Cedric replied. \"How's that?\" \"Because I know something about Max that you don't know.\"[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight \"Ok Cedric,\" Danny said anxiously, \"what do you know about Max?\" Danny and Cedric were seated at the kitchen table in Danny's apartment. Danny had locked Destimona and her birdcage in the closet so she couldn't hear the conversation. \"Well, to start off,\" Cedric replied, \"you remember how Max killed Antonio deMilo to get his powers right?\" \"Um, yah,\" Danny replied confused. \"But how did you know that? I thought it was only me and Alyson who knew about that.\" \"Alyson has filled me in on quite a lot,\" Cedric replied. \"But back to the point. Apparently every few generations a few truly powerful sorcerers are born. You're one of them, and so is Max, and so was deMilo.\" \"Yah, I already know that,\" Danny replied. \"Tell me what I don't know.\" \"Well, what you don't know,\" said Cedric, \"is that there is only so much power that a sorcerer can possess. Think of it like a water bottle: there is only so much water it can hold. Well, when Max killed Antonio deMilo, he didn't realize that he couldn't contain all that power. So, he got an amulet called a Wizard's Bank. It's not technically a bank, but has the same idea. Basically, he used the amulet to hold all of deMilo's powers for future reference. Once he well, kills you , he will get another amulet to hold your powers in.\" \"So your saying that the amulet has all of deMilo's powers?\" Danny asked. \"What would have happened if Max had tried to keep all of those powers at once, since you said he couldn't?\" \"He would have exploded,\" Cedric replied casually. \"Well, how is this information going to help us save Alyson and let me keep my powers?\" \"Well, when Max killed deMilo and put his powers into the amulet, he also sealed a life sentence. What I mean is, if that amulet is ever destroyed, Max will explode and be gone. Simple as that.\" \"Wow, so you're saying that we take the amulet, crush it and destroy Max for good?\" Danny asked, impressed with Cedric's hidden knowledge. \"Exactly.\" \"Where is the amulet?\" Danny asked. \"That's the bad part,\" Cedric replied. \"What do you mean?\" \"The amulet is back in the magic mansion in New Orleans,\" Cedric answered. \"Are you serious?\" Danny said, with bitter disappointment in his voice. \"We don't have time to go to the airport, fly all the way to New Orleans, and then back. It's on a completely different continent.\" \"Don't you know some teleportation spell or something?\" asked Cedric. \"Because if you do, you could teleport yourself to the magic mansion, get the amulet, and come back, all in about five minutes.\" \"I've only learned three new spells since I've come here,\" Danny answered. \"And teleportation isn't one of them. All I can do is turn myself and others into animals, levitate stuff, and turn invisible.\" \"Well, Alyson mentioned a spell book in her text,\" said Cedric. \"One that you got at the library. Why don't we check it out to see what it says about teleportation?\" \"That's the problem,\" replied Danny. \"It's back at the library. Alyson and I returned it and that's where we met Max.\" \"Well why don't we go there now?\" asked Cedric. \"Right now, it's the only way I can see to help us get out of this mess.\" Danny sighed. He knew that Cedric was right. \"Ok,\" he mumbled after a little bit. \"Let's go.\" So Danny and Cedric left the apartment (with Destimona still locked in the closet of course) and set off for the library. When they got there, Danny found that it was still in the drop off box where he and Alyson had left if before Max had attacked. It hadn't even been put back on the shelves yet. \"Ok, we've gotta find it fast,\" Danny said anxiously. Cedric nodded, and they began quickly flipping the pages of the ancient book searching for anything about teleportation. \"This is it!\" Danny cried after searching almost the entire volume. \"Teleportation, this is it!\" \"Nice, we've found it,\" Cedric exclaimed excitedly. \"Up top!\" Danny exchanged a high five with Cedric, before glancing back to the page. \"Ok, it says here that to teleport, you have to say the name of the place, and chant the following spell: North, South, East, West, Near, Far, Up, Down, Lift Me Up and Take Me Now… It also says to be extremely specific as to where the location is. The spell wares off after one hour, so we'll have to be quick.\" \"Ok, so our location is the Magic Mansion, in New Orleans, in Louisiana, in the United States, in North America, in the Western Hemisphere…\" Cedric began. \"Uh, Cedric, I think they get it,\" Danny interrupted, chuckling a little. \"Now, since you're not a wizard, you won't be able to come with me, so I want you to return back to the apartment, and make sure everything over there is OK. All right? You said that Alyson texted you, so make sure that you can keep in contact with her.\" \"Don't worry, Danny,\" Cedric replied confidently (which was weird because back in the days of the reality show at the mansion, he had been scared of everything), \" you can trust me to make sure everything goes smoothly. \"Max won't even see it coming.\" \"Speaking of which, where in the magic mansion is the amulet kept?\" Danny asked. \"No clue,\" Cedric admitted. \"And you only have an hour to find it, so make sure you search quickly.\" \"Right,\" Danny replied. \"Ok, here goes. Teleport: I want to go to the Magic Mansion in New Orleans, Louisiana.\" Danny began to recite the magic words to the phrase. Suddenly, the library grew dark, and a strong breeze, no wind began to rush around Danny. It went around him faster, and faster, and faster, until Danny slowly began to disappear. Eventually, he was completely gone and the wind stopped. Danny had returned to the Magic Mansion.[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine Danny opened his eyes. He was no longer in the library in Paris. That meant that he had done the spell correctly! Excitement pulsed through Danny's veins at the thought that he was actually starting to get good at his magic. Looking around, he realized he was in a large park in New Orleans. The air was hot and humid, and there were banana trees and tall sycamores. After living in Paris for so long, Danny had forgotten how much he had loved New Orleans, despite that it was no longer safe for him here. Ok, I've got to find the Magic Mansion fast, Danny thought. I've only got one hour. The sound of a trolley nearby told him that the mansion was nearby. After all, he remembered from the reality show, that the New Orleans trolley system had run right by the Magic Mansion's front lawn. Quickly, Danny raced down the street, and hopped across the trolley tracks. There it was! It was just as big and mysterious as Danny remembered it from when he had first arrived with Alyson. Back of then of course, they had had no idea of how evil Max really was. He ran strait up the front steps to the mansion and knocked on the door. There was a large hideous gargoyle on the handle. No one answered, so Danny knocked again, and when he still received no response, he turned the doorknob and was amazed to find out that it was open. Quietly, so as not to be noticed by anyone inside, Danny slipped inside and quietly shut the door. Meanwhile, back in Paris, Cedric had returned to the apartment. He was about to check his cell phone to see if he had received any new information about Alyson, when he heard a loud squawking coming from Danny's closet. What could that be? he wondered. Inside the closet, Danny found a large wire birdcage with a pigeon inside. Why would Danny have a pigeon in his closet? Cedric wondered. It's probably a mistake or something. \"Here you go little guy,\" he said, as he opened the cage door and let the pigeon fly out the open window. \"I have no idea why Danny had you in there, but now you're free to go to the park with all the other pigeons.\" Cedric had always loved animals, and hated to see them in captivity. What he didn't know was that he had just released Destimona, Max's daughter into the city. What a stupid kid, Destimona thought as she flapped her wings as fast as she could away from the apartment, laughing that she had outsmarted Danny. Destimona had heard everything through the closet walls. She now knew that Alyson and Max were at the top of the Eiffel Tower, about the amulet, and that Danny had gone to the library to learn how to teleport himself back to the Magic Mansion. Max will so pleased with me when I tell him this, she thought to herself. The Eiffel Tower was right across the river from where Danny's apartment was, so Destimona didn't have to fly far. Man, this thing is tall, she thought as she flapped her way all the way to the top. There, she found Max enjoying the view, and Alyson sitting unhappily in a large metal cage. \"Destimona, my daughter,\" Max said, when he noticed the pigeon flying over to him. \"What do you have to tell me? Is Danny ready to hand over his powers?\" \"Actually, father, he's back at the Magic Mansion. He found out about the amulet, and he's gone back to crush it and destroy you.\" \"WHAT?!\" Max asked. His face immediately turned from being sly, confident, and sure that his plan would work, to panic. \"If he finds the amulet, I DIE!\" \"I knew that Danny would win,\" Alyson said, from the cage. \"You don't always win, now do you Max?\" She was clearly enjoying this. \"He's only got an hour to find the amulet,\" Destimona reminded her father. \"Perhaps, he won't find it.\" \" Perhaps isn't good enough,\" Max said. He was really starting to worry now. \"There's only one thing to do. I must go back to the Magic Mansion and stop Danny. I'll put a stop to this once and for all!\" \"But there's no possible way you'll be able to fly all the way to New Orleans in time,\" Alyson pointed out. \"Have you forgotten that I'm a sorcerer, Alyson?\" Max asked her. His confidence was quickly coming back. \"You don't really expect me to just let Danny get the amulet do you? I'm to clever for that! No, I'm going to teleport myself back to the Magic Mansion.\" With that, Max began to recite the teleportation spell, the same one that Danny had found in the library. He must have memorized all the spells in the book, Alyson thought. Once Max had finished reciting the spell, and listing the location of the Magic Mansion, a strong wind began to swirl around him. It spun faster and faster until Max was gone. Something terrible is about to happen, Alyson thought. She wished that she could warn Danny about Max. But he never brought his cell phone with him. Back at the Magic Mansion, Danny was franticly searching the maze of halls, corridors, and rooms for the amulet. He'd searched the library, the secret room, all the dorm rooms, and even the room where the miniature knights were held. And still, he hadn't found a single object that resembled the amulet that Cedric had mentioned. Worse still, only fifteen minutes remained until the spell wore off! \"Looking for something?\" a sickeningly familiar voice said. Danny whirled around, even though he already knew who it was… Sure enough, Max was standing in the hallway, smiling wickedly.[Chapter 10] Chapter Ten \"Are you looking for something?\" Max repeated the question. \"I thought you might be looking for… this?\" He pulled a gold chain from out of his pocket. Attached to it was a large red stone. The amulet! Danny couldn't believe it. He just stared at Max and the amulet, dumbfounded. For one thing, he couldn't believe that Max had found he was at the Magic Mansion, and for another, he couldn't believe that the amulet was right in front of him, in the hands of the villain. Max chuckled. \"If you're wondering where I keep this, it was in my office, in the bell tower of the mansion. And if you're wondering how I knew you were here, the answer is that Destimona escaped and told me you and Cedric's entire plan. You thought you were going to get away didn't you? Well too bad, because you're NOT!\" Danny still couldn't believe it. Everything was going to work, up until now. \"Where…where is Alyson?\" he finally asked. \"Back in Paris,\" Max replied. \"Don't worry; I haven't hurt her – yet . She's in a cage at the top of the Eiffel Tower. So, I'm going to give you one more chance, Danny. Hand your powers over now and turn Destimona back, or you AND Alyson will both die.\" \"NEVER, Max!\" Danny shouted defiantly. \"Give it up Danny,\" Max said chuckling. \"You're not getting yourself out of this. I have the amulet, and you don't. And now if you don't hand over what is rightfully mine, I'll finish the job I almost succeeded in completing on the night of the final performance.\" \"Not on my watch Max,\" Danny replied. \"So be it.\" With that, Max shot out his fist. A glowing beam of green light flashed out of it and picked Danny up, hurling him into the air. But Danny countered him by using the animal spell to morph into a parrot. Now that Danny was naturally airborne, Max's levitating spell had no effect on him. But Max wasn't finished yet. He morphed into an enormous golden eagle, and lunged towards the parrot, his talons outstretched to tear Danny's flesh. Got to think of something bigger than an eagle, Danny thought. And then it came to him. Just seconds before Max in eagle form was about to tear off his face, Danny morphed into wolf, and plunged back to the floor, with a thud. The wind was knocked out of him for a few brief moments, but he got it back, just in time, because Max had changed into an enormous Grizzly bear, and was swiping his paw towards Danny. Time to get out of here, thought Danny. He quickly morphed into a cheetah and prepared to speed his way out of the room. That's when he noticed that Max had left the amulet on the floor when he had morphed into the Eagle. Bingo! Danny thought excitedly. He rushed over to the stone necklace laying on the floor, and grabbing it in his cheetah jaws, sprinted away. \"NO!!!!\" he heard Max roar behind him. \"Listen here Danny, if you so much as scratch that amulet, I'll… I'll\" \"You'll what, Max?\" Danny shouted behind him as he sped away with the amulet gripped tightly between his teeth. After a few moments, he had lost Max in a cloud of dust. (Ok, not technically, but if they had been outside, Danny would have caused a huge cloud of it). \"I've got to find something to break this thing!\" Danny muttered to himself when he reached the mansion's kitchen. He morphed back into his human self and gripped the amulet tightly in his fist. \"It won't be long before Max is here.\" \"DANNY!!!\" came Max's voice from down the hall from the kitchen. \"Danny, I'm gonna get you! You can't stop me now!\" \"CRAP!\" Danny cursed, rushing over to the kitchen door trying desperately to lock it. Unfortunately there was no lock to that particular door, so he rushed to get a mop and a chair to block it from being opened. He built a rough barricade that would last up to one minute at most, and set again to looking for something in the kitchen to break the amulet. He selected an extremely large butcher knife from the knife board and began hacking away at the stone. \"Why won't it break?!\" Danny cried, panicking. He tossed the butcher knife aside and grabbed a large metal rolling pin that he used to smash. Still, it wouldn't brake. \"DANNY LET ME IN!!!\" Max was roaring from the other side of the kitchen door. He was pounding so hard that the some of the dishes in the kitchen were slipping off their shelves and crashing to the floor in smithereens. And the makeshift barricade was slowly becoming looser and looked like it was ready to bust. \"One last shot!\" Danny shouted to himself as he selected a steel frying pan and starting beating the amulet with it. He hammered away at it. Suddenly, the chair and mop gave way and Max burst into the kitchen, his face as red as a hot chili pepper! \"Danny, when I'm finished with you\" – Max roared. But he never finished his sentence. Because at that moment, the amulet finally succumbed to the frying pan that Danny was beating it with, and it shattered into thousands of pieces.\" Max gave one despairing look at the amulet and then let out a loud wail. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" he bellowed. It was just like a scene in a movie, where the villain is finally defeated and begins to melt or something. But this was better, because it was real. Max begin to grow hotter and hotter, and his face turned redder and redder, until he suddenly burst into flames and burnt to the floor, becoming nothing more but a pile of ash. Danny just stood there staring. \"I…I can't believe it,\" me whispered to himself. \"I've really done it, I've… I've finally defeated Max. I can't believe this.\" He glanced over at the amulet, which was slowly fading away. It took a few minutes for the reality to actually register. When it did, Danny jumped into the air, shouting from excitement and happiness. And suddenly, the clock in the kitchen, an old grandfather clock with an image of an owl carved into it, rung. The hour was up. But that was ok. Danny had accomplished what he needed to. The wind began blowing around him faster and faster until he was no longer in the Magic Mansion. When he stopped spinning, he opened his eyes and realized that back in the library, in Paris. The place where he had last been before he teleported back to New Orleans. There was still the feeling that there was something that had to be done. Of course, I still have to rescue Alyson! Max and Cedric had both mentioned that she was locked in a cage at the top of the Eiffel Tower. So, Danny began sprinting out of the library to go find her. There it was. The Eiffel Tower, soaring thousands of feet above him. He had seen it everyday while living in Paris, it was impossible to go anywhere in the city where you couldn't see it towering over all the other buildings, but now that he was standing directly under it, it had never seemed as tall as it did now. And Alyson was at the very top. He ran over to the nearest elevator. In big bold letters were the words: Out of Order on a sign on the door. \"Oh please,\" Danny muttered, \"Max did this.\" But when he pushed the button for the door to open, it did nothing. I guess I'll have to take the stairs, Danny thought. He ran over to the nearest staircase, ignoring the sign that said the tower was closed. This is all because of Max. It took forever to climb up. After climbing to the first level of the tower, Danny was already exhausted. \"Must keep going,\" he told himself. Finally, twenty minutes later, Danny reached the top. \"Danny, you came back!\" he heard Alyson's voice call. He looked to see where the voice was coming from. Sure enough, there was Alyson, locked in a large wire cage. \"I suppose Max put you in there,\" Danny said, walking over and snapping the lock off. \"What happened?\" Alyson immediately asked him. \"Where's Max? Did you find the amulet?\" \"Whoa, whoa, hold up,\" Danny interrupted laughing. \"One question at a time. Max is gone. Forever!!!\" It took a few moments for Alyson to digest the information. \"So you finally defeated him?\" \"Yep.\" \"Oh my gosh, Danny that's great!!!\" Alyson screamed excitedly. \"How did you do it?\" \"I'll explain everything, I promise,\" Danny replied. \"But first, let's go find Cedric, he helped a lot in this too.\" \"Yes, of course,\" Alyson answered. \"Oh my gosh, I'm just so excited! All your work finally payed off. I can't believe we never have to worry about Max again!\" \"I know, I know,\" Danny replied, without the least trait of anxiety in his voice. Ever since the night of the final performance, he had been jumpy, and nervous, worried that Max would come get him. For the first time in two years, his mind was finally at ease. \"You know,\" Danny said, before they walked toward the staircase. \"We've got a great view up here. What do you say we go find Cedric later and just enjoy he sunset? It's such a beautiful city.\" \"You know something, I think you're right,\" Alyson replied. The two of them stood gazing over the rail as the sun set over Paris. Below them, they could see the Seine River flowing lazily by, and in the distance, Notre Dame's bells were ringing for the night. It was the perfect end, to a perfect day, to an unperfect two years. Max was gone. At last. THE END ","Summary":" Chapter One I can't go on like this , thought Danny Sinclair.

Manyrnkids behind her rushed outside pushing past her roughly, causing herrnto drop her books. She was wearing a long seelve green shrit and dulled blue jeans, her hair hanging freely around her shoulders. When the bus pulled away from the curb, she kneltrndown and picked up the books brushing her goldne hair out of her face. \"Hey,rnbookworm better get to class, before the teacher gives you an A-,\"rna kid called over to her as he throw a cropped up piece of paper atrnher and the group around him laughed and chuckled heartily. Allysonrnkept her head held high and just walked past into school, but insidernshe felt like crying. She had to go through this everyday and itrnalways seemed to get worse. She could feel a single tear roll downrnher face as she headed to her first period class, math. It went fine,rnbut afterwards it began to get a little ugly. \"Hey,rnknow it all could you do my math homework,\" a boy named John askedrnwalking up to her. Allyson turned and looked at him and then said,rn\"No thank you.\" Sherntried to keep walking, but John grabbed her arm and spun her aroundrnsaying, \"Listen you brat I need a passing grade in math now do myrnwork or I'll tell Ms. Whalen you cheated on that last test.\" \"Irndidn't cheat,\" Allyson cried both offended and slightly afraid. John was the captain of the football time and he had connections.rnSighing she held out her hand excepting the math text book. Johnrnalmost slapped the textbook into her arms, before walking off downrnthe hall, followed by the others of the football team. All of themrnsoftly laughed as they past her, calling out names like \"bookworm,\"rn\"now it all,\" and \"suck up.\" Allysonrnwaited for them to pass before she headed to her next class. That'srnhow it went for her most days' people laughing, teasing and askingrnher to do their work. It wasn't like she wanted to do there work,rnbut if she didn't she would get beaten up by her peers, mainly thernfootball players, but everyone in the school knew she was a know itrnall girl, and stayed away from her as much as possible. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thernnext few classes went along as normal until English class. \"So,rnwhat is the symbolism of Macbeth seeing the dagger as he'srnwalking?\" the teacher, Mr. Smith asked. Allyson's hand instantlyrnshot up as she waited to be called upon. She could hear the otherrnstudents chuckling and shaking there heads. \"Anrnone beside Ms.\" Justrnthen a knock came at the door. The door opened and the principal camerninto the class with a slip of paper in his head. He looked at Mr.rnSmith saying, \"I have an annoucment to make.\" \"Ofrncourse go right a head,\" Mr. Smith said stepping back. Thernprincipal (Mr. Lee) walked up the head of the room and addressed thernclass. \"Goodrnafternoon, I'm pleased to say we have a new student joining ourrnschool so I would like you to treat him with respect and be welcomingrnas possible, good afternoon, back to you Mr. Smith.\" Mr.rnLee handed the teacher a note and then left the room. Mr. Smithrnglanced after him and then down at his sheet of paper. Looking up hernsaid, \"Alright lets give a big Hello to Daniel Sinclair.\" Justrnthen the door reopened to reveal a young boy about seventeen standingrnin the door. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hope you enjoyed more soon, I promise. Please review. Please. Thanks[Chapter 3] Hope you enjoy this chapter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Justrnthen the door reopened to reveal a young boy about seventeen standingrnin the door. Hernhad dark brown hair and dark misty blue eyes. He was wearing ribbedrnjeans and a loose read shirt. He had a small frown on his face. \"Yournmust be Daniel Sinclair,\" Mr. Smith said watching the new student. \"It'srnactually Danny,\" the young man said shortly as he came into thernfront of the class. All the girls seemed to swoon over him at once,rnbut Allyson simply rolled her eyes slightly. \"Well,rnDanny would you like to tell us anything about yourself,\" Mr. Smithrnsaid encouragingly. \"Myrnname is Danny Sinclair and I'm looking forward to get everyone ofrnyou,\" he said softly, casting a small smile at the girls in thernback of the room. The girls sighed as if they had been hit by cupid'srnarrow. \"Well,rnI'm sure they feel the same way about you. Now Danny could you takerna seat beside Miss Miller, she's one of our top students,\" Mr.rnSmith said pointing to the next to Allyson. He nodded and walkedrntowards Allyson. And Mr. Smith went back to teaching. \"Hello,rnwhat's your name?\" Danny asked Allyson. Yet before she could sayrnanything, another voice behind him said, \"Don't mind her, I'mrnLena and you're Danny right.\" Hernnodded and began talking to Lena almost forgetting about Allyson. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Byrnthe end of school, the new student seemed to be the talk of thernschool. All the girls were swooning over him and the boys loved him.rnHe seemed to be a big sports kind of guy. Everyone was talking aboutrnhim except Allyson. She was packing up when she saw a large group ofrnpeople heading towards her. It was the football team with John in thernlead. She turned trying to leave before they saw her, but no good. \"Heyrnknow it all you have my work from yesterday,\" John called over tornher. Allyson sighed turned and forced a smile as she said, \"No I'mrnsorry I left it at home sorry.\" Johnrnlooked at her and frowned saying, \"You better be joking Allyson.\"rnShe shook her head and waited. As if automatically John punched herrnright in the stomach and pulled out all her books and throw them allrnover the place. Then they stormed off to get ready for a game. Allysonrnheld her stomach trying to stop the pain and then became to startrncollecting her books. When she was just putting her last textbook inrnher backpack she heard a group of voice beside her. \"Isrnthis yours?\" a male voice asked. Allyson turned and saw the newrnstudent Danny crouching down next to her holding out her textbook forrnher. \"Thanks,\" she responded softly, not meting his eyes. \"Nornproblem, it's Miss Miller right,\" he asked watching her. \"Allyson,\"rnshe said taking the book from him and standing up. Danny stood up toornsaying, \"So, Allyson how many classes are you taking?' \"Arnfew.\" \"Whatrnare you some know it all kind of person,\" Danny said laughingrnsoftly. Allyson didn't say anything, but quickly pushed past himrnand began walking down the hall leaving him alone. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Walkingrnto her bus she heard yet another voice calling out to her. \"Well,rnif it isn't the bookworm,\" a female voice said mockingly. Allysonrnglanced around and saw Lena standing near her. Lena was the head ofrnthe cheerleaders and she was almost as bad as John. \"Whatrndo you want Lena,\" Allyson asked. Lena laughed and said, \"Wellrnsince your doing John's homework would you mind doing mine too.\" BeforernAllyson could say anything Lena was already piling her own books intornAllyson's arms. \"Thanks bookworm,\" Lena said as she turned andrnwalked away from her. Allyson sighed going onto her buss and taking arnseat in the back and tears rolled down her face. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter. More soon I promise Please review please.[Chapter 4] Hope you enjoy this chapter. Thanks to Dramaqueen for helping me. I oen nothing but the plot and the unknown charators. On with the story I hope you enjoy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Aboutrntwo months had passed since Danny and Allyson had talked. Everyone inrnschool seemed to be talking and hanging around him. He was the mostrnpopular guy in school now, and Allyson was completely forgotten aboutrnexcept for people \"asking\" her to do their work and beating herrnup. Onernday in late January, Allyson was sitting be herself at lunch, whenrnshe caught a glimpse of the football team, cheerleaders and Dannyrnheading her way. She sighed, but went back to her lunch. Hoping theyrnwould just leave her alone. Yet luck seemed to be against her, likernalways. \"Hey,rnbookworm, what are you doing,\" Lena asked mockingly. Allyson didn'trnsay anything, but continued to eat. John's eyes glinted as he movedrnover to Allyson and forced her to look at him, \"Hey, she wasrntalking to you.\" \"Heyrnman, leave her alone,\" Danny said pulling John away. John turnedrnlooking at Danny and then said, \"Come on, we were just teasing her,rnit's cool right Allyson.\" Allysonrnlooked at John and slowly nodded her head saying, \"Yea good onernJohn.\" \"Comernon Danny, we're going to be late for class,\" Lena said swingingrnhis arm around Danny's own. Allyson looked at Lena and thenrnquietly picked up her belongings and left the room. For the pastrncouple of weeks, Lena had been hanging out with Danny almost now stoprnat school. With Danny being the most popular guys in school, it wouldrnlook good for her image, but Allyson doubted that she actually likedrnhim, even as a friend when it really came down to it. Yet,rnshe had no friends what so ever, so how and why should she judgernothers. As she sat down in a deserted hallway she thought she heardrnfootsteps. She looked up and sure enough Lena and Danny were walkingrnand talking to each other. \"Oh,rncome on how did you do it,\" Lena whined playfully. Danny shruggedrnand gave a small smile as he said, \"I don't know, but it wasrncool.\" \"Arernyou a magician?\" Lena asked smacking his shoulder playfully. \"Irnguess I am, and you know the rule no telling secrets.\" \"Comernon can't you-hey bookworm,\" Lena said noticing Allyson. Sherndidn't look up, but said, \"What's this about you being arnmagician?\" \"Ohrnnothing, but do you have my book report?\" Lena asked quickly.rnAllyson turned looked through her backpack and pulled out Lena'srnfolder and handed it to her. \"Yourndid her work, cool could you do mine,\" Danny asked teasing her,rnwith a smile on his face. YetrnAllyson didn't look up and see his face, but held out her handsrnwaiting for the books. Danny was take-in a back for a second andrnlooked down at her confused. Whenrnshe didn't feel the books in her arms she stood up saying, \"Yournknow next time; if you're just going to play jokes don't talk tornme Mr. Sinclair.\" Withrnthat she turned and walked down the hall. \"Holdrnon Allyson,\" Danny called after her holding out his hand. As he didrnthat a locker opened, but she was already past it. So instead ofrnstopping her it hit her in the back of the head causing her to fall. Danny stood there unable to move, completely confused and afraid atrnwhat he had just done. He was brought back when he heard Lenarnlaughing. \"Oh,rnyea wonderful job-hey where are you going?\" Lena asked as Danny ranrnup towards Allyson. He kneed down next to her asking, \"You ok?\" \"Yea fine, just leave me alone.\" snapped Allyson robbingrnthe back of her head and standing up and beginning to walk outside. \"Allyson wait.\" called Danny. \"NO!rnStop just leave me alone.\" screamed Allyson as she walked out ofrnthe building. Danny stood there in confusion when suddenly Lena camernup to him \"Don't waste your time on her she's a know it all,rnknow one likes her and call her bookworm.\" snickered Lena. \"Nornway, I mean you don't even know her, maybe there's a different sidernof her.\" stated Danny, still semi- lost in his own thoughtsrnlooking after Allyson. \"Yea whatever if you want to hang with me you have to be mean tornher.\" stated Lena. \"No, and Lena has anyone ever told yournthat you're a bitch.\" with that Danny ran off to find Allyson. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hernwas walking around for what seemed like forever, but soon he heardrnvoices coming from the school courtyard. He John's voice saying,rn\"Hey, what did you do to make Danny dump my girl?\" \"Irndidn't do anything,\" Allyson stated firmly, but backed up slowly.rnJohn moved closer towards her, not noticing Danny walking up to him.rnJohn nodded to one of his friends. His friend named Gab walked up andrnpunched Allyson in the stomach and smacked her face. Allysonrnfall to the ground and tried in vain to protect herself. \"Hey,rnget away from her,\" Danny said running up to her. Gab stoppedrnmomentarily as he looked up at Danny, but then went back to beatingrnAllyson. Dannyrnwasn't sure what to do and all the teachers and other staff wherernin the teachers langue and none of them really cared anyway. Allysonrnwas completely silent as her abuser beat her. Danny couldn't thinkrnof anything to do as he watched this. Finally he grabbed Gab by thernshoulder turning him around almost screaming, \"Leave her ALONE!\" Nornsooner had the words left his mouth, Gab had vanished. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review.

Danny was just as confusedrnas everyone else. Remembering Allyson he looked at her saying, \"Comernon we have to get you to the nurse.\" Shernshook her head saying, \"I can go by myself.\" Yet as she tried tornstand she fall back down on the ground. \"Whatrnhappened here?\" a heavy and deep voice called behind the group.rnEveryone turned and saw Mr. Lee standing there arms crossed lookingrndown at the Danny and Allyson. \"Mr.rnSinclair, how dare you attack Ms. Miller, my office now and Allysonrngo to the nurse and get checked out,\" Mr. Lee said as he lookedrnsternly down at Danny. All the kids around them didn't sayrnanything, but watched the two other kids. NeitherrnAllyson nor Danny looked at each other as they stood up and walkedrnback into school and the parting down the hall. InrnMr. Lee's office Danny was still in disbelief and confusion. \"Whatrnthat hell happened, first the skate board with Lena and now this…amrnI same kind of a freak or something ,\" he thought to himself overrnand over again. Finallyrnthe door opened and Mr. Lee came inside. He sat down behind his deskrnand looked at Danny straight on. \"Mr.rnSinclair, Danny…you understand that hurting another student is arnbig crime here,\" Mr. Lee said sighing. Danny's eyes locked on thernprincipia as he said, \"Sir, I didn't do anything to her, I wasrntrying to get Gab Benson off of her Sir.\" \"Butrnif that were true, Danny than why were you there standing next herrntoughing her.\" \"Sir,rnI'm telling the truth he was, but…\" Danny's voice trailed offrnand he started glancing around the room, anywhere but at Mr. Lee. \"Butrnwhat Danny,\" Mr. Lee prompted. \"Irndon't know… I was trying to get Gab off of her and h then hernvanished.\" \"Vanishedrnas in ran away.\" \"Nornlike diapered completely,\" Danny said now looking in Mr. Lee'srneyes. \"Alright,rnlook until you're ready to tell the truth Danny you can considerrnyourself in detention for the rest of the week starting now,\" Mr.rnLee said standing up. \"ButrnSir,\" Danny tired, but Mr. Lee dismissed him. Sighing in disbeliefrnand frustration Danny left the office and headed to the detentionrnroom. All the students began to whisper as he walked past. Lena camernup to him asking, \"How bad was it?\" \"Irngot detention, no biggy,\" Danny said as he continued on walking.rnYet, Lena stayed behind and started talking to her old friends. \"Isrnhe an alien or some kind of freak,\" one girl asked. \"No,rnhe's the devil,\" a boy whispered. Comments and rumors flew allrnaround him as he walked towards detention. Once inside he sat down atrnone of the desks and placed his head in his hands thinking. Yet,rnnothing made sense; maybe he just had to talk to Allyson. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thernnext day at lunch Danny walked in the cafeteria and saw Allyson oncernagain sitting by herself. The he saw the football team andrncheerleaders. He walked up to there table expecting them to makernroom, but instead they moved closer to each other. \"Heyrnguys could you make room,\" he asked holding his tray. John stood uprnsaying, \"Sorry, this for normal people not freaks.\" Everyonernaround him laughed and the other students didn't say anything, butrnDanny could feel the stars from all of them as he walked by. Hernglanced around, but found no open seat. So he left and went outsiderninto the courtyard with his tray of food. Hernsat down and starting to eat his lunch in peace, ignoring all thernstars. Just then a voice called out to him, \"Hey Danny yournalright?\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter, more soon I promise.[Chapter 6] Hope you enjoy this chapter.

Just then a voice called out to him, \"Hey Danny yournalright?\" Hernglanced up and saw Allyson standing over him. \"Hey,rncome to make fun of the freak,\" Danny said as he went back torneating his sandwich. Allyson sat down next him, not saying anythingrnfor a little bit. After a few moments of silence she said quietly,rn\"Thank you.\" \"Forrnwhat?\" he asked setting his sandwich down and looking at her. \"Forrnstanding up for me yesterday, no on else would've done that,\" shernsaid looking at him a small grateful smile creeping onto her lips. Hernnodded saying, \"Yea, well I didn't think it was right for you tornget beat up because you were doing something right.\" \"Thanksrnagain and how are you?\" \"Fine,rnbut I was wondering if you could do my homework after helping yournout,\" Danny said teasing her. \"Isrnthat why you helped me?\" she asked turning on him sharply. Dannyrnlaughed saying, \"No of course not, but now thanks to you I knowrnthat I'm so kind of a freak, so in a way you owe me.\" Allysonrnrolled her eyes and stood up, \"Look, thanks again, but I shouldrnreally get to class, see ya later.\" \"Wernstill have 30 min,\" he began, but Allyson was already walking away. Dannyrnstood up once more ignoring the comments from the other students andrnwent looking for Allyson. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- He went all over the school and was aboutrnto give up, but then he heard a guitar playing in a closed room. Hernquietly walked in and opened the door. He had been right it had beenrna guitar he had heard. He found himself in the Hernducked behind some chairs and listened quietly. Allyson was sittingrnon the stage and was singing to herself. Her voice held tears inrnthem, but her voice held power and emotion with every word as shernsang to her invisible audience. Yourndon't know my name you don't know anything about me I try tornplay nice I want to be in your game The things that you say Yournmay think I never hear about them But word travels fast I'mrntelling you to your face I'm standing here behind yourrnback Chorus: Yourndon't know how it feels To be outside the crowd You don't knowrnwhat it's like To be left out And you don't know how itrnfeels To be your own best friend on the outside looking in Ifrnyou could read my mind You might see more of me that meets therneye And you've been all wrong Not who you think I am You'vernnever given me a chance Chorus: Well,rnI'm tired of staying at home I'm bored and all alone I'm sickrnof wasting all my time Yourndon't know how it feels To be outside the crowd You don't knowrnwhat it's like To be left out And you don't know how itrnfeels To be your own best friend on the outside looking in Shernstrummered the last chords and then sighed. Placing the guitar downrnbeside her she whipped away her tears, but snapped her head up, whenrnshe heard a rich, warm voice say, \"You're right I don't knowrnyou, but I would like to get to know you…would you like to try tornget along?\" Shernlooked up whipping her tears away and starred at Danny. Then she gavernhim a small smile as she said, \"I'd like that too.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review.

Allysonrntried to walk past them, but John blocked her path, \"Not so fastrnAllyson, here's all my work for tonight,\" he said dropping whatrnfelt like six sender blocks into her arms. Bothrnof walked off as Danny came up to them. \"Do you need help?\" hernasked motioning to the six textbooks Allyson held. \"Sure,rnbut you shouldn't be doing this if you ever want to get back tornbeing popular again,\" she said adjusting her backpack on her back.rnHe nodded, but laughed as he said, \"Well from what I heard I don'trnthink that's going to happen any time soon.\" \"Whyrnnot?\" \"BecausernGab was found in a tree hanging by a belt hoop,\" he said as theyrntook a seat in the back of the bus. \"That'srnimpossible Danny,\" she said shaking her head. \"Butrnif that were true then how do you explain he vanishing like that?' \"Irndon't know, but Lena said you were a good magician,\" Allyson said lookingrnat him. \"Yearnthat, I'm not sure how that thing happened either…People arernright I am a freak,\" Danny said. Just then the bus pulled up to arnstop and Danny stood up ready to leave when Allyson cried, \"Heyrncould I came with you.\" Hernturned around unsure of what to say, but then shrugged saying, \"sure,rnbut this isn't your stop.\" \"Irnknow…but I thought… we could, hang out a little bit,\" she saidrnas she followed Danny. \"Sure,rnmy parents both work so I'm home by myself,\" Danny said as thernbus doors closed behind them. Allyson nodded and followed in silencernas they headed towards his house. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Afterrnabout ten minutes of walking, they reached a nice dulled white twornstory house. Danny lead Ally insidernhis house. \"You've got a nice home.\" said Ally. \"Thanks,rnso what do you want to do?\" asked Danny \"I'm not sure, butrnI can't stay to late I half to do all this homework.\" said Ally. \"Allyson,rnyou know if maybe you had some courage and stood up to them you won'trnhave to do all of there homework.\" stated Danny. \"Irnalways want to but every time I want to open my mouth I lose myrnvoice.\" said Ally. \"Butrnmaybe if you just try, and after you will feel incredible.\" saidrnDanny as he smiled at her. \"Thanks,rnso what happened with Gab and this weird thing, has it happened tornyou before?\" asked Ally. Danny looked at her for a few seconds,rnand decided to tell her, because he had a good felling inside and hernknew that he could trust her. \"Well,rna few years ago I was walking to my old school and I saw thisrnreally cool skate board in a store window and I was thinking tornmyself how much I wanted that thing…and about two seconds later itrnwas under my feet and I was riding it,\" he said seating down at thernkitchen table. Allysonrnnodded as she sat down across from him saying, \"You mean you stolernit, be accident.\" She had to laugh, but stopped shortly afterrnstarting muttering, \"sorry.\" Hernshook it off saying, \"It's cool, so why don't we get working.\" \"Ohrnwhat?\" she asked a little confused. He pointed to her backpack andrnshe groaned slightly, \"right that, but you really don't have torndo it, it's my problem not yours.\" \"Well,rnit doesn't mean that I can't help you finish it more quickly,\"rnhe said as he picked up a book and began flipping through book. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Afterrna while, Allyson checked the clock and gasped, about three hours hadrnpassed. Gasping she began to quickly began grabbing her booksrnstuffing them into her backpack. \"Irnhave to go, I've stayed here to long,\" she gasped almost rippingrnJohn's text book out of Danny's hands. \"Myrnparents should be home soon, they could give you a ride and what'srngoing on?\" Danny asked completely unsure of her sudden fanaticrnbehavior. \"No,rnit's fine, thanks for everything Danny, I'll see you tomorrow,\"rnShe cried zipping up her backpack. She was so frantic about leavingrnthat she didn't even notice her long selves had rolled up. Dannyrnnoticed and starred. Along her arm there were bruises, cuts and evenrnsome slices that could've been made by a knife. Beforernhe could say anything Allyson yelled a quick, \"bye see you later.\"rn As she darted towards the front door. He heard the front doorrnalmost slam shut behind her, he got up and walked towards the door. He looked out and noticed her running at top speed down the street.rnHe knew her house was only a block or two over from his, but sherncould still run fast. Hernwas left alone, with those few images of her bruised arms runningrnthrough his head and it almost made him cry. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review. More soon I promise.[Chapter 8] Hope you enjoy this chapter, Thanks go to those who gave me ideas for the cheapter thanks. I hope you enjoy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thernnext morning Danny caught Allyson before class. \"Hey,rnyou alright?\" he asked, going up to her locker. She turned towardsrnhim as she closed her locker saying, \"I'm just fine Danny, why dornyou ask?' \"Well,rnyou left my house in a big hurry yesterday, and I\" \"It'srnnothing Danny, my Dad's just very, uh, strict that's all,\" shernsaid closing her locker and began heading to her math class. Dannyrnwalked beside her almost instantly falling in step with her. Afterrna few minutes of silence Danny stopped and looked at Allyson directlyrnasking, \"You sure you're alright?\" Shernstopped, turned and starred back at him saying, \"I'm fine Dannyrnreally. I'm-oh great.\" Shernstopped when she caught sight of John and Lena walking towards them.rnLena was the first to speak. She seemed surprised, confused andrnalmost discussed as she asked, \"Danny, why the heck are you hangingrnout with the bookworm?\" Allysonrnlowered her eyes to the floor. Almost naturally Danny placed his armrnaround Allyson's shoulder saying, \"That's really none of you'rernconcern is it Lena?\" Lenarnwas take-in a back, but John stepped in saying, \"Hey, back off manrnand know it all, do you have our work?\" Shernnodded, but then Danny said, \"Actually she has something to say tornyou both, go on Allyson.\" Shernhad been pulling out the books, that she almost missed what Danny hadrnsaid. She blinked and glanced from Danny to Lena and John. Johnrnstarred at Allyson and crossed his arms saying, \"Well what is it?\" Allysonrnopened her mouth, but no sound came out, so she closed it and loweredrnher eyes and handed them their work. \"Comernon lets leave these freaks,\" John said and he walked pushing pastrnthem. Lena glanced at Allyson and shoved her down to the floorrnsmirking as she left following John down the hall. Danny glared afterrnthem, but then turned towards Allyson. Kneelingrndown and collecting her books he asked, \"you alright Ally?' Shernnodded, holding her stomach. As he handed her back her books hernnoticed a triangle of blood leaking through her dark blur shirt. \"Allyson,rnwhat's that?\" Danny asked pointing to her shirt. She looked downrnand winced in pain saying, 'It's nothing Danny really forgetrnabout it?\" \"No,rnAllyson you're hurt and I saw your arms yesterday before you ranrnout on me. Something is really up, what is it?\" Danny cried takingrnher waists in his hands, but she didn't meet his eyes. \"Didrnthey do it to you Allyson?\" he asked tilting her chin up so thatrnshe was looking directly at him. She starred into his deep his darkrnblue concerned eyes and tears began to flow down her face and shernburied her face into his chest, not caring about them being seenrntogether and made fun of. \"Itrnwas John, Danny…he was angry, because I hadn't done his work andrnhe started beating me up and then he took out his pocket knife andrnbegan slicing my skin. Then when he was doe he said, if I ever forgotrnor didn't do his work it would be worse each time,\" Allysonrnsobbed. Dannyrndidn't know what do to do, but continued to stroke her hair sayingrngently, \"It'll be alright Ally, you'll see I promise you hernwouldn't harm you ever again…now came on lets get you to thernnurse and why didn't the nurse say anything the other day.\" Allysonrnstood up shaking slightly as she said, \"Well, I told her was clumsyrnand that everything was fine-\" \"Andrnshe believed you?\" \"No,rnbut I think she feels that I have to stand up on my own two feet,\"rnAllyson said as they walked into class. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Atrnlunch that same afternoon, Danny went looking for John. He found Johnrnand his team by the football field practicing. Walking onto thernfield, Danny called over to John, \"John, how could you hurtrnAllyson, like that.\" \"Whatrnare you talking about you freak,\" John said turning to face Danny. \"Irnsaw what you did to her John and I mean it if you touch her againrnyou'll be died.\" \"Ohrngetting very protective off that little slut are you Sinclair. Well,rntell her something from me if she ever disobeys me, she'll be asrngood as dead,\" John said his eyes glinting with fire. At thisrnDanny's blood began to boil and soon John was levitated about tenrnfeet in the air. Everyonernwatched in silence as they starred up at John. Danny looked up atrnhim, but then snapped out of his hatred turning it to confusion andrnfear. Once his thoughts had changed through John began to fall at toprnspeed towards the ground Danny regained concentration long enough ornlower John to the ground on harmed. YetrnJohn starred at Danny and screamed as loud as he could, \"FREAK,rnYOU'RE A FREAK!\" Then he collapsed, fainted on thee ground. Dannyrnstarred at John for a few seconds and then at everyone else. I bidrngroup had formed around them, Allyson among them. Danny looked atrnher, there eyes meting a for seconds, before Danny darted away fromrnthe coward. Allysonrntried to look for him all day, but he was no where to be found. Hernhad vanished and she didn't know where or why. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review, more soon. Promose.[Chapter 9] Here's the next chator. I don't know anything about Allyson's home life in the movie. This is my story I can have it be what ever I want ok. Also a new charator is introduced in this chapter. She's protrayed by Amanda Machaicka (can't spell her last name, but she's Aly's sister in real life.) Also I now that there only two years about, but for my story it's going to be more 6 or 7 years apart. I hope you enjoy this chapter on with the story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Afterrnschool Allyson went over to Danny's house. She didn't see any carrnin the drive way, but then she remembered that Danny had said hisrnparents worked. He glanced up at the window and saw a shadow movingrninside. So, he knew he was home. Slowlyrnand quietly she walked up and knocked on the door as loudly as sherncould. Inrnwhat seemed like only a few seconds Danny was standing on the otherrnside of the door. \"Whatrndo you want Allyson?\" he asked shortly. \"Yourndisappeared so quickly after the whole John thing, I was worriedrnabout you,\" she said quietly starring straight into his eyes. Hernshook his head not saying anything. \"MayrnI come in?\" she asked taking a small step forward. Danny shruggedrnas he pushed open the door to invite her inside. She walked insidernand then turned around to face him saying, \"So, what happened backrnat school.\" \"Irndon't really know,\" Danny said simply, but there was fear andrnconfusion in his eyes. Sitting down at the kitchen table they sat inrnsilence for a while. Then he muttered a ,\"do you want something torneat or drink?\" \"Arnglass of water would be fine,\" she said gratefully. After taking arnfew sips of water she looked at him saying, \"So, you must be arngreat magician to levirate someone in the air with invisible wires.\" Sherntried to make it sound like a joke, but he didn't laugh, justrnstarred at her with his eyebrows raised. She stopped and looked downrnat the glass in her hands. Finally Danny spoke, \"I think I'mrngoing to have to move a new town again.\" Atrnthis her head snapped up as she said, \"A new town, what do you meanrnDanny?\" Hernlooked up and smiled at her teasingly saying, \"Yeah my parents havernto move every time I'm upset.\" Allysonrnsaw his teasing face and shook her head in disbelief, but that idearnof him leaving wouldn't leave her mind. Just then they heard therndoor open and a voice calling out, \"Danny, you home?' \"Hey,rnMom I'm in the kitchen,\" Danny yelled back. A few seconds later arnmiddle aged women appeared in the doorway. She was dress in bluernjeans and soft pick sweater and her brown hair was held up in a ponyrntail. She was carrying bags of food in her arms. Placing them on therntable she said, \"Danny your school called today it seems you leftrnwithout permission.\" \"Irnknow Mom I'm sorry, but I had another problem,\" Danny saidrnstarting to unpack the bags. Just then his mom noticed Allyson. \"Danny,rnaren't you going to introduce me to your friend,\" Mrs. Sinclairrnasked looking at Allyson. Danny nodded saying, \"Yeah sorry, Mom metrnAllyson Miller, Allyson met my Mom.\" \"It'srnnice to meet you Mrs. Sinclair,' Allyson said shaking the woman'srnhand. \"Samernhere Allyson,\" Mrs. Sinclair said warmly. Then turning back tornDanny she said, \"Alright so what happened this time.\" \"Irnreally don't know Mom, but I think what ever it is it's gettingrnworse and everyone at school is making me feel like a freak andrnstuff, except Allyson,\" Danny said still unloading the bags. Afterrna few hours Allyson stood up saying, \"It's getting late I shouldrnprobably go, it was ice to met you Mrs. Sinclair.\" \"Yournto dear,\" Mrs. Sinclair said as she was washing the dishes. Dannyrnstood up to saying, \"I'll walk you home if that's alright.\"rnShe looked at him for a few moments and the nodded a face on herrnlips. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Theyrnwalked almost in complete silence to Allyson's house. When theyrnreached it she turned saying, \"Thanks for everything Danny and yourrnparents are great.\" \"Well,rnI'm sure your parents are great too,\" he said giving her a smallrnsmile. She looked at him, but at that last statement lowered her eyesrntowards the ground. Seeing this Danny asked quietly, \"Hey, isrneverything alright with your parents? Are they devoiced orrnsomething?\" Allysonrnshook her head and was about to say something when the door opened. Arnyoung voiced called, 'Hey Ally, you better come inside quick he'srnin one of his moods.\" Dannyrnturned and saw the speaker from the hall light. It was a young girlrnmaybe 10 or so and she had blonde hair like Allyson, butrnstraighter. Her eyes seemed the same resisting blue as Allyson, butrnshe looked thinner and paler than Allyson. \"I'llrnbe right there, just stay out of his way you hear Sara,\" Allysonrncalled back. \"Alright,rnbut hurry,\" the girl, Sara said closing the door quietly behindrnher. \"Shernseems like a nice kid, sister?' Danny asked looking at Allyson. Shernnodded almost laughing to herslef, \"when is he ever in a good mood., but I hope it's better than yestarday.\" \"YourrnDad, is he an abuser or...- I'm sorry I shouldn't be prying into your personalrnlife sorry,\" he said quickly. Allyson looked at him saying, \"Nornit's fine. You see Sara's my sister. Our parents died about fourrnyears ago in a car crash.\" \"I'mrnso sorry Allyson, but then who is that she was talking about?' \"Wellrnyou see my parents didn't have any other relatives so we were putrninto an orphanage, but no one would take two girls. Fina;;y we were abopted and we live with our care taker named Max-\" \"Allysonrnget in here now he's asking about you, and I think he's going to explod on fire\" Sara said her voicernshaking and her lip quivering appearing at the doorway. Allyson rnpaled slightly, nodded and run towards the house. Remembering Danny she called over her shoulder, \"See you later,\"rnbefore shutting the door. Danny was left alone on the darkeningrnstreet as the moon was raising in the night sky. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, when I said Max I meant MAX ( from the movie). Hope you enjoy this chapter, please review. more soon. I promise.[Chapter 10] Hey here's the next chapter. Sra again is Ally's ten yearold sister protrayed by Aly's real sister Amanda. Also the song is called As Constant as the Stara Above by it's creater. I DON'T OWN it. Max is still a wizard in this story. I hope you enjoy this chapter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Allysonrnplaced her backpack down in the front hall, just as she heard yellingrnfrom another room. Running into the kitchen she saw Sara in arncorner shaking and silantly crying and an old man standing over her. Sara's eyesrninstantly fall on her big sister. \"Whatrnis it Max?\" Allyson asked quietly, but took a step forward. Maxrnspun around glaring at her. \"Wherernwere you Allyson?\" he asked almost yelling at her. \"Justrnat school and studying with someone from school,\" she answeredrntaking a step closer to her sister. Max grabbed her waist and twistedrnit tightly. Allyson could feel her skin burning under his grip, butrnshe made no sound. \"Irnthought I told you, you could go to school as long as you came rightrnhome, did your chores and made me dinner. And is this about yournstudying with someone, that's what Sara's here for,\" Maxrngrowled. \"Well,rnmaybe I could study with her, if you let her go to school instead ofrnkeeping here inside all day,\" Allyson retorted. Usingrnhis other hand Max smacked her hard across the face saying, \"Bernglad I let you go Allyson I'm not going to waste money on twornbitches to go to school, now where's my dinner.\" Hernreleased her wrist and she pulled it back and held it tenderly in herrnother hand. The skin was rare red from where Max had gripped it andrnit was swelling a little too. Holding back tears she began to makerndinner. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WhilernMax was eating dinner in the TV room Allyson kneeled down next Sararnasking quietly, \"Go up to bed Sara. I'll be up soon and bernquiet.\" Thernyoung girl turned looking up at up sister and slowly nodded. Shernscrambled up and walked quietly to the stairs and ran up them. Shernstopped at the top, when she heard the sound of dishes breaking. Shernheard Allyson scream as she was thrown against a wall. Then morernglass shattering and Max growling loudly, \"Clean up this mess yournlittle bitch and get to bed.\" Tornscared to do anything Sara ran up to her and Allyson's room, closedrnthe door, locked it and hid underneath the blankets. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aboutrnan hour or so later Sara heard a gently knock on the door. Sararndidn't move until she heard a soft voice calling, \"Sara it's mernopen up the door, it's alright.\" Sara got up slowly, opened therndoor and looked up at her sister. Allyson'srnface was all covered in cuts from the glass and her hair was in arntangle. Sara gazed up and tears began to fall down her face as shernhugged her sister tightly. Walkingrninto the room, closing the door and kneeing down Allyson asked,rn\"Sweetie what's wrong?\" \"I'mrnso…sor..ry Ally, I tried to make his dinner and stuff, but he justrngot madder. Saying I was nothing…but a brat… and a… worthlessrnbeing that didn't… even deserve to be…\" her voice trailed offrnas her sobs overwhelmed her. Allyson hugged her tightly as she pickedrnSara up and brought her over to the queen size bed they shared. StrokingrnSara's hair Allyson asked softly, \"What did mad Max do thisrntime?\" Sara chocked out a laugh at Allyson's nickname for Max.rnThen she stopped and pushed away from Allyson's embrace surprisingrnAllyson. \"Whatrnis-?\" Shernstopped when she noticed Sara was pulling up her selves and thernbottom of her shirt to reveal her arms and wrists and stomach. Theyrnburns and big black and blue bruises all over them. Allysonrnstarred at them and felt as if her heart was about to break. \"OhrnSara, I'm so, sorry I never knew he had started this again, whenrndid it start again?\" Allyson asked gawking at her little sisterrnwith tears in her eyes. Sara sighed covering them up again whispering, \"It was yesterdayrnand today, when you didn't come home soon enough.\" \"I'mrnso sorry I'll come home right after school, and I'll make sure hernnever hurts you again baby,\" Allyson said as she picked up a washrncloth and began washing Sara's cuts and bruises. Afterrna few minutes Sara turned to face her sister. \"Ally, I'm hungry,rnhe didn't feed me last nigh or tonight,\" Sara said just as herrnstomach growled. Both girls laughed and the Allyson smiled as shernsaid, \"Well I actually do have a PB and J sandwich.\" She handedrnit to Sara. Sara took it, but then broke it in half and handed onrnhalf to Allyson. \"Thanksrnsis,\" Allyson said smiling. Sara smiled back nodding an \"yourrnwelcome.\" Afterrneating and getting ready for bed, Sara asked, \"so Ally, who wasrnthat guy outside?\" \"Notrntonight Sara, come on time for bed,\" her big sister said pullingrnthe covers open. Crawling underneath Sara asked, \"Ally, could yournsing mom's lullaby.\" \"Ofrncourse Sara, but then it's really time for bed,\" Allyson said asrnshe too climbed down the covers. It was their mother's favoriternsong and she used to sing it to them every night when they werernyoung. Bringing her sister into a hug, Allyson began to sing softly. Constantrnas the stars above Always know that you are loved And my lovernshining in you Will help you make your dreams come true Willrnhelp your dreams come true The lamb lies down and rests itrnhead On its mother's downy bed Dolphin plays in thernmoonlight's glow And butterfly dreams of a violet rose Dreamsrnof a violet rose I'll cradle you in my arms tonight Asrnsun embraces the moonlight The clouds will carry us off tonight Our dreams will run deep like the sea Our dreams will runrndeep like the sea Constantrnas the stars above Always know that you are loved And my lovernshining in you Will help you make your dreams come true Willrnhelp your dreams come true Asrnshe sang the last line, the sisters drifted off into a peacefulrnsleep. Their dreams carrying them away from all the pain and lonenessrnof the world. Allyson also dreamt of the only other one who cared forrnher other than her sister. A smile formed on her lips for the firstrntime in what felt like years. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter Please review, more soon I promise. Please review.[Chapter 11] Here's the next chapter. Hope you enjoy it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thernnext morning Allyson rose early. The sun was just beginning to rise;rnquietly as possible she got up and started to get ready for school.rnShe padded on make up to cover up the cuts, it worked. She wasrnwearing a dark pink shirt and dulled blue jeans today. She was justrnopening the bedroom door, when a small tired voice called out,rn\"Ally?' Allysonrnturned slightly and walked back up to the bed saying, \"go back tornsleep Sara, I'm going to make his breakfast and then go to school.rnJust stay here and stay out of his way, I'll see you later.\" \"Allyson,rnwhat about-\" \"Don'trnworry Sara, I'll come home right after school I promise you, be arngood girl while I'm gone alright,\" Allyson said as she kissed herrnsister's forehead. Soon Sara fall asleep again and Allyson slippedrnout of the room as quiet as a mouse. Inrnschool that afternoon, Danny came up to her asking, \"Hey Allyson.\" \"Oh,rnhi Danny, how are you?\" Allyson replied putting her books in herrnlocker. Danny nodded, \"I'm fine you?\" Allyson was about to say,rn\"I'm fine.\" Yet she felt the cool air against her burned wristrnand quickly pulled her sleeve over it, but he had already seen it. \"Whatrnhappened Allyson? I've never seen anything like that,\" Danny saidrntrying to get a better look at her wrist, but she pulled away. \"It'srnnothing Danny really,\" she said as she turned and began walkingrndown the hall. As they walked Allyson stopped short groaning. Lenarnand John were heading her way. \"Irnforgot to do their work oh crud,\" she muttered under her breath tornherself. Shernhad been taking care of Sara and making sure Max wouldn't get madrnthat she had completely forgotten about their work. She had barelyrnfound time to finish her own work. \"Bookrnworm do you have our work,\" Lena asked crossing her arms as shernstopped right in front of Allyson. Allyson gulped unsure of what torndo. \"Isrngod just against me for my whole life, first Max and now theserncreeps,\" she thought to herself bitterly as she starred at Lena.rnBefore she could say anything Danny placed his hand on her shoulderrnsaying, \"come on Ally, we'll be late for class, see you guysrnlater.\" Allysonrnheld in her wince as Danny laid his hand over a cut under her shirt.rnJohn took a step forward, but Danny gripped his friend's hand andrnsimple turned and walked away. John yelled after them, but Danny andrnAllyson tried not to take notice. Dannyrnand Allyson walked into their classroom. It was empty, not even thernteacher was there, even though her stuff was on the desk. Takingrnthere seats Danny asked, \"Allyson, now will you tell me what'srngoing on?\" Shernlooked at him for a few moments, before lowering her eyes shaking herrnhead. \"Wasrnit John or Lena again?\" \"No,\"rnshe whispered gently. \"Thenrnwhat's-\" Hernstopped when the teacher and other students began filing into thernclassroom. He leaned close and whispered in her ear, \"Later.\" Shernsimple nodded and started to focus on the class work, but her mindrnwondered off to Sara. How was she? Was she safe and alright? Was Maxrneven now tormenting her, because Allyson was there to stop him? Allrnthose thoughts raced through her mind and she thought she would breakrndown right there in class. She sat in her seat trying to regain focusrnon the lesson, but nothing worked. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Soon enough class was over and she horridly picked uprnher stuff and left the room, Danny following close behind her. \"What'srngoing on Allyson?\" Danny asked as they walked to the bus. \"NothingrnDanny, why do you ask?\" she asked glancing at him and quickeningrnher pace. Danny almost had to jog to keep up with her saying, \"Yournjust seem in a big hurry,\" he stopped walking, \"and speaking ofrnbig, here comes big trouble.\" Allysonrnturned and groaned. Lena and John were heading her way again. Lenarnsmirked as she shoved her books into Allyson's arms, \"hey you gornand make sure it's done tonight you got that.\" \"Andrnif you don't well we'll just have some fun,\" John said pullingrnout his pocket knife enough for both Danny and Allyson to see it.rnWith that they walked off and Allyson and Danny walked onto the bus. Slippingrninto a seat in the back Allyson grunted, \"great, now I'll be uprnall night.\" \"Butrnyou seem like you get enough sleep,\" Danny said smiling slightlyrntrying to make it a joke. Yet Allyson wasn't paying attention tornhim, she was starring out of the window and tears were rolling downrnher face. Withoutrnthinking she reached up and brushed them away, unfortunately whippingrnoff some of the make up along with the tears themselves. \"Allyson,rnwhat happened to your face?\" Danny asked in an alarmed whisper.rnRealizing what she had done she quickly brought her hand up trying torncover the cuts, muttering, \"Nothing.\" \"That'srnnot anything Ally, what happened?\" Danny began to say, but stoppedrnwhen he saw that he was at his stop. He stood up saying, \"you wantrnto come to be house and talk?\" Sherndidn't say anything, but simply looked out of the window. Sighingrnhe left and got off the bus. Watching it leave he couldn't get thernimage of Allyson's bruised face out of his mind and he didn'trnunderstand how anyone could hurt anyone like her. He was going tornfind out. Stickingrna note on the front door, Danny hopped on his bike and rode over tornAllyson's house. It took him about five minutes and he was nervous. He didn't see a car in the drive way, but that didn't mean thatrnthe guardian wasn't home. Placing the bike behind a small stonernwall that run along one side of the yard Danny slowly made his way tornthe front door. Hernknocked on it and waited. About a minute later he heard the doorrnunlock and the handle turn. The door opened and he \"came face tornface\" with Allyson's young sister Sara. He remembered seeing herrnthe other night, but when she saw him she cried, \"Allyson!\"rnbefore almost slamming the door in his face. He was surprised andrnshocked to say the least, but he waited. Afterrnabout two minutes later the door opened again revealing... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed that chapter, please review, more soon I promise.

For the sake of the story lets pretend it's around like 5:00 in the afternoon. I hope you enjoy this chapter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \"Whornare you?\" an old man asked glaring down at Danny. Danny looked uprninto the man's eyes and stammered, \"I'm…sorry if I disturbedrnyou Sir but\" \"Danny,rnwhat are you doing here?\" Allyson called from behind the man. Thernman turned and looked at Allyson. She was holding a wash cloth and arnbucket of water in her right hand. \"Yournknow him,\" Max sneered. Allyson dared to glance up as she replied,rn\"Yea, I know him from school Max, his name is Danny Sinclair…Dannyrnmet Max, Max, Danny.\" Maxrnlooked at Danny thinking, but then dismissed the thought asking,rn\"Well is there a reason for this surprised visit Mr. Sinclair?\" \"Irnwas just stopping by to see-\" \"Tornsee about the homework, with him being sick he didn't go to schoolrnand his parents would be disappointed if he didn't get his workrndone,\" Allyson spoke up as she placed her supplies down and pickedrnup Lena and Johns' books form the hall table. Allyson spotted Sararnlooking from around the corner, but Allyson shook her head mouthing,rn\"later.\" Turningrnback she moved past Max saying, \"I've got this and I think Paulrnwanted to see you Max.\" Maxrnnodded saying, \"Yes, it was nice to met you Danny.\" \"Yourntoo Sir,\" Danny called as Max left the hall. Allysonrnbreathed a sigh of relief as she stepped fully outside. Danny finallyrnsaw her fully. Her sleeves were rolled up exposing her bruised armsrnand her face was now fully uncovered by the makeup showing the cutsrnfrom the night before. \"Allyson,rnwhat happened?\" \"I'mrnfine Danny, but could you do me a huge favor tonight,\" Allysonrnasked quietly. Danny nodded leaning in a little closer. Allysonrnhanded him the books, a post it was on it. Looking down he read,rn\"could you please do their work.\" Dannyrnglanced up and nodded silently, but then whispered, \"Why?\" \"Irnhave a lot of other work to do,\" she whispered back. Then Allysonrngave him a small smile and mouthed, \"thank you.\" Thenrnhanding the books over she stood up and turned to go back into thernhouse. \"Ally,rnwait,\" Danny called out. \"Yea,\"rnshe said turning back to face him. Danny looked down at first andrnthen said, \"Is this Max hurt\" Hernwas cut off by a small cry. \"Allyson,\" the person yelled.rnAllyson spun around and headed for the door. Both she and Dannyrndarted into the house, but Allyson spun around almost colliding withrnDanny. \"Gornhome Danny, it's alright,\" Allyson said quietly, her sisters'rncries ringing in her ears as she spoke. \"Nornsomeone's hurt,\" Danny barked back. Allyson was about to sawrnsomething, but then heard Max yell, \"Allyson get in here right now,rnyou bitch.\" Allysonrnpaled major. Without saying another word to Danny, she darted downrnthe hall with Danny following quietly followed behind her. Allysonrnrun through the kitchen doo and froze. Danny peeked in and his eyesrnnearly jumped out his eye balls. Max'srnhand was pinning Sara's wrist behind her back, his own handrnsteaming. Sara's wrist was burning red. \"Max stop.\" Allyson screamed tears pouring down her face,rn\"She's just a kid.\" \"Shut up you bitch! And if your friend is still here he's goingrnto tell on me and if he does I'm going to kill him, you hear thatrnDanny, I know your still here.\" yelled Max as he took his handrnoff of Sara. Sararnran into Allyson's out stretched arms and hugged her feely andrnsobbed into Allyson's chest. Without thinking Danny burst throughrnthe door to the kitchen. \"HeyrnMax, stop you've already hurt these girls enough.\" yelledrnDanny. \"Yournknow Danny I have a very special gift and I can kill you.\"rnstated Max. \"No!\"rnyelled Danny. As he yelled, Max was lifted up from the ground intornthe air and was thrown against the wall. Danny froze, looked atrnAllyson, but she was too shocked to notice. Danny ran out of the roomrnand out the door, running at top speed. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BothrnAlyson and Sara ran up stairs at top speed. Grabbing the little theyrnhad out already they shoved it into Allyson's back pack and startedrnto climb out of the window, Allyson first than Sara. They reachedrnthe ground and ran together into the night. Asrnthey were leaving Max lifted up his head and said to himself. \"He'srna wizard.\" SoonrnAllyson and Sara collapsed. They had run at top speed for what seemedrnlike forever. Allyson glanced around, it looked they were in the parkrna few miles away from their house. Sara laid her head againstrnAllyson's chest and sobbed even harder than before. \"Whatrnhappened Ally,\" she sobbed. \"Irndon't know Sara, but we have to spend the night here alright,\"rnAllyson said stroking Sara's hair. Sara nodded, but more tearsrnfall. Soon she had cried herself to sleep. Allyson soon joined her,rnbut her dreams raced with images of Danny and what had happened backrnat the house. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter and thnsk to Drmaqueen for helping me. Please review. More soon. I promise[Chapter 13] Here's the next chapter, hope you enjoy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thernchilly morning air woke Allyson up the next morning. She blinkedrnlooked around the area. She had been right it was a park, and theyrnwere behind a big oak tree. Suddenly Allyson's watch buzzed. Shernglanced down at the time, 7:00. She gulped she couldn't missrnschool, but at the same time she couldn't leave Sara alone. Gentlyrnshe shook her sister saying, \"Sara, sweetie time to get up.\" Sararnrobbed her eyes, yawned and looked up at Allyson. \"Sweetie,rnit's time for school,\" Allyson said and turned away and gotrnready. Sara clumsy sat up asking, \"What are you talking aboutrnAlly.\" Allysonrndidn't say anything, but began to pull stuff out of her bag andrncursed under her breath, her makeup was back at the house. \"Ally,rnwhat are you talking about school?\" Sara asked shifting closerrntowards her big sister. Allyson turned and starred at Sara, thanrnsaid, \"here let me take a look at your arm.\" ReluctantlyrnSara extended her wrist for Allyson to examine. Allyson cupped herrnhand under it, but didn't touch it as she looked. The rim of Sara'srnsmall wrist was burned to secondary sunburn and it was rare red. \"Itrnlooks alright, but I'll have to clean it up,\" Allyson said as shernpulled out a bangle rap and carefully wrapped it around her wrist.rnWhen that was done Allyson checked her watch, stood up and held outrnher hand for Sara to take. \"Wherernare we going?' Sara asked as she took a hold of Allyson's hand. \"School,\" her big sister replied simply. So, together bothrnsisters headed for school, careful of the path they took. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whenrnthey reached the schoolyard with about five minutes to spare, Allysonrnsaw Danny almost at once. He was sitting by herself with his head inrnhis hands thinking. Sara pulled out of Allyson's grasp and began tornrun up to him, but. Allyson ran after her and caught her. \"Whatrndo you think your doing?\" Allyson asked. At her voice Danny lookedrnup and then began to leave. \"Dannyrnwait,\" Allyson called after him as she ran after him almostrndragging Sara with her. Danny didn't turn around, but said, \"so,rncome to make even more fun of the freak.\" \"No,rnwe came to thank you Sir,\" Sara said stepping in front of Allyson.rnDanny turned and looked down at her saying, \"What are you talkingrnabout?\" \"Yournsaved us Sir, Max might have killed us,\" Sara said looking up atrnDanny. Then Allyson stepped forward and said, \"That's right, yourndid, but we still need a place to…,\" she lowered her voice andrnleaned in closer to him, \"hid from him.\" Dannyrnlooked at her thinking and then said, \"I know a place, but what isrnshe doing here?\" \"Irncouldn't leave her alone with him probably looking for us,\"rnAllyson muttered. Just then Sara spoke up saying, \"you guys know Irncan hear you.\" Bothrnteenagers looked down and then laughed when they saw Sara'srnexpression on her face. Just then a voice cut quickly through the airrnmaking both Allyson and Danny groan. \"Bookworm,rnyou have our work?\" John asked coming up to them. Allysonrndidn't say another, but Danny pulled out the work from his backpackrnand handed it to him saying, \"Here take it and leave us alone.\" \"Who'srnthis Danny, your little girlfriend?\" Lena asked from John's siderntalking about Sara. Neither Danny nor Allyson said anything, butrnbegan to walk to class with Sara in front of them. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Laterrnthat day after school Danny, Allyson and Sara walked through thernforest. It was a nice day, but Allyson was on alert for almostrnanything that reminded her of Max. At took them about half an hour,rnbefore they came to a clearing. It had hard solid ground, a lot ofrntrees, but it still let the sun through them. In the middle was arnwooden shake, with two windows and a solid roof. \"Irnbuilt it with one of my old friends when I was about eight, no onernknows about it and the path to it is almost impossible to learnrnunless you know where you're going,\" Danny said stepping throughrnthe low door frame. The inside was covered with dirt and somerncobwebs but it was tall and it had a rocking chairing at one end ofrnit. It wasn't huge, but big enough for a few people to life well,rnnot extremely comfortable, but well. \"Thankrnyou Danny it's perfect,\" Allyson said setting her back pack down.rnHe nodded and said, \"You're welcome to use it for as long as yournwant.\" Sararnsuddenly ran up and hugged him saying, \"thank you so much Mr.rnDanny.\" \"It'srnjust Danny,\" he said smiling as he returned the hug. So, for thernnext few hours they spent cleaning up their new home. Whenrnit was binging to get dark, Danny said, \"I should get going I'llrnsee you torromow.\" He stood up and walked outside. \"Danny,rnwait,\" Allyson called running out after him. He turned and he couldrnsee tears in her eyes. On impulse he reached up and brought her intorna hug. \"Thankrnyou, I really owe you my life,\" Allyson cried hugging him backrntightly. He stroked her hair saying, \"no you don't. No one shouldrnbe hurting you. You're so smart, funny and a great caring personrnthat I love so much.\" Allysonrnpulled away slightly and looked up at him confused, \"what did yournsay?\" Dannyrnblushed slightly as he replied, \"I love you Allyson.\" Whenrnshe didn't respond he began to release her, but she pulled him backrnand into a kiss. The kiss was so pure, that both of them lost themselves in thernmoment and deepened the kiss. \"Allyson,\"rnthe heard a voice say shocked, almost like a mother, a few moments later. They broke arnpart and saw Sara starring at them her small arms crossed, but arnsmile on her face. Both teenagers laughed and then suppurated. \"Well,rngood night Ally, Sara,\" Danny said quickly and then left. \"Goodrnnight Danny,\" Allyson called and turned around, a true pure smilernplaced on her lips. Thernrest of the night was peaceful, like it used to be four years earlierrnbefore any of this happened, both sisters felt safe and happy….forrnthe time. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed that chapter, please review. more soon I promise.[Chapter 14] Here's the next chapter hope you enjoy it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Forrnsafety reasons, Allyson decided to bring Sara back to school insteadrnof leaving her alone. She knew Max well enough that he would wait forrnone of them to be a lone and Allyson couldn't live with herself ifrnshe had internality put Sara in harms way. So Sara came to school andrnwas Allyson's cousin from out of town and visiting for thernsemester. Laterrnthe next day, Allyson, Sara and Danny were eating lunch when Lenarncame up to them. \"So,rnhow are you related anyway?\" she asked Allyson and Sara. \"Cousin,\"rnAllyson said shortly as she went back to her sandwich. \"We'llrnwhatever anyway, just wanted to let you know john is sick today sornyour not going to have that much homework, just from me. but tomorrowrnJohn will have double so including mine that's triple.\"rnsnickered Lena. Allysonrnlooked up at Lena and stood up saying \"No Lena, I'm not going torndo any more of you or Johns homework anymore.\" stated Ally. \"Ohrnyes you are.\" said Lena as she tried to punch Ally, but Allyrnquickly pushed her hand away.\" No.\"rnstated Ally as she looked Lena in the eye. Lena stared at Ally for arnsecond and walked away. Just then Sara spoke up, \"yea that'srnright you better run my cousin would have beat you up so bad.\" \"Sararnno, what are you\" Allysonrnwas cut off as Lena run up and tired to punch Sara. Yet, instantlyrnAllyson had stepped in front of Sara and taken the punch in the face.rnLena smirked as she said, \"well that'll teach you, Bitch.\" Atrnthis Allyson snapped her head around and tackled Lena to the groundrnand a \"cat fight\" broke out. Students gathered around andrnshouted, \"fight, fight.\" Over and over again as the two girlsrncontinued to go at each other. Dannyrntried to break it up, but Lena punched him in the jaw. Sara justrnstood silently watching with the rest of the kids, unsure of what torndo. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally the Mr. Lee came out and yelled, \"what the heck isrngoing on here.\" Atrnthe sound of his voice all the students turned and quickly backed offrnand left the area, leaving Sara, Danny, Lena and Allyson alone. Mr.rnLee looked down at the two girls and yelled, \"hey break it up RIGHTrnNOW!\" Dannyrnwalked up and had to pry Allyson off of Lena, with her still kickingrnand screaming at Lena. Once Lena hand stood up and Allyson had calmedrndown a bit Mr. Lee spoke up. \"MayrnI ask what has gotten into you both?\" \"Itrnwas Allyson's fault she punched me,\" Lena cried as she pointed tornher black eye. \"Me,rnwhat about you,\" Allyson shot back pointing to her own black eye. \"Enough,rnLena go to the nurse and as for you Miss Miller came to my officernright now,\" Mr. Lee said as he turned away and began to walk backrninside. Lena smirked and Allyson shot her a death glare as she turnedrnand followed Mr. Lee inside followed by Danny and Sara. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- InrnMr. Lee's office, Allyson sat in a chair across from his desk,rnDanny and Sara sitting next to her. \"MissrnMiller I've never know you to be violent.\" \"Itrnwasn't my fault Mr. Lee,\" Allyson said sitting up straighter. \"Irndon't care whose fault it was Allyson, but I still have to callrnyour guardian and let him know what happened.\" Allyson,rnSara and Danny all exchanged glances of fear and unsure about what torndo. \"Mr.rnLee, our house phone has been down for the past few days, but you canrnuse his work number,\" Allyson said. Sararnstarted to say something, but Allyson kicked her under the table.rnBefore he dialed he turned to Danny saying, \"You can go Danny,rnsense you weren't really involved with this.\" Dannyrnnodded and stood up, but slipped a note to Allyson and the left thernroom. Allyson unfolded the note and read it. It had a number on it.rnMr. Lee picked up the phone and Allyson read him the number on thernsheet of paper. He dialed and waited for the other line to pick up. \"Hello,rnMr. ah yes, Mr. Paul, I was just coming to talk to you about AllysonrnMiller. She got into a fight with another student,\" Mr. Lee saidrnbefore posing as the other person spoke. \"Allyson,rnreally she's never been a problem before,\" the speaker answered. \"Irnunderstand that and I just wanted to let you know and that I wouldrnlike to see you do something about it, Mr. Paul,\" Mr. Lee replied. \"Yes,rnof course, oops, I have to go, thank you Mr. Lee for telling me thisrnand I'll ake sure she knows not to do it any more have a nice day,\"rnthe speaker said. Thenrnthe line went died. Mr. Lee hung up the phone and then looked atrnAllyson saying, \"Alright, Miss Miller you may go, but if I find yournfighting again I will take matters into my own hands is that clear.\" \"Yes,rnthank you sir,\" Allyson as she stood up. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Leavingrnthe room both Sara and Allyson looked at each other unsure of whatrnhad happened. \"So,rnhow did it go?\" Danny asked walking up to them from the end of thernhall. \"Fine,rnbut it was weird too,\" Allyson said. \"Irnunderstand that and I just wanted to let you…\" Danny's voicerntrailed off. \"What?rnAnd that's what Mr. Lee said on the phone,\" Sara said confused. Allysonrnlooked at her and then back at Danny, who was smiling as he held uprnhis cell phone. Allyson smiled at him, walking up to him and givingrnhim a kiss. Danny returned it as he hugged her too. \"Aw,rnthat's so sweet, it makes me sick,\" a cold voice said from downrnthe hall, coming closer. Allyson and Danny broke apart and spunrnaround gasping. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review, more soon I promise.[Chapter 15] Here's the next chapter, hope you enjoy it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maxrnwas standing just a few feet away. \"Max?rnBut how?\" questioned Allyson as she pulled Sara behind her. \"AllysonrnI knew you would still go to school, you being a know it all\" Maxrnlaughed as he watched her eyes flicker with fear and augur at hisrnnaming calling. \"Max don't hurt her.\" said Danny taking a step towards Max. \"DannyrnI don't want to hurt her, I want to hurt you.\" laughed Max. \"What,rnwhy?' both Allyson and Danny asked together. Max smirked as hernadvanced on them, \"Well, after Danny threw me back into the wall, Irnrealized that you're a wizard, like me.\" \"Arnwhat?\" the trio asked all buggy eyes looking at Max. He laughed asrnhe took a step forward and the trio backed away. \"Arnwizard,\" Max repeated smirking at Danny. Allyson glanced at Dannyrnfear in her eyes that she didn't notice Sara slip in front of her.rnHowever Max did notice and a fire ball formed in his hand. Dannyrnsaw this and darted in front of Sara taking the attack for her.rnAllyson screamed and ran up to him. Kneeling down next to him shernexamined the burn. It looked like a regular sunburn, but it hadrnripped his shirt exposing the burned skin. \"Considerrnthat a warning Danny,\" Max sneered as he turned away andrndisappeared before them. Allyson starred after him her heartrnpounding. \"Yea,rnfine, but you gotta...\" but before Danny could finish Mr. Leerncame running out of his office. \"What happened, I heard an explosion, Danny are you all right?\"rnasked Mr. Lee. \"Mr.rnLee, I just found him here, I don't know what happened.\" Allysonrnsaid not looking directly at him. \"Alright, take him to the nurse, quick I'll help you. out.\"rnsaid Mr. Lee as he helped Danny up. Mr. Lee and Allyson both helpedrnDanny walk to the nurse, Sara walked fast over as well. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whilernthe nurse was helping Danny Sara walked up to ally. \"Ally arernyou ok?\" asked Sara. \"Sararnwhy did you go in front of me, if you didn't Danny would not haverngotten hurt.\" said Ally. \"Ally I'm sorry.\" said Sara. \"Sara how could you be so careless, you know Max and what he canrndo. Use your head for once, but no you couldn't even do that andrnnow Danny's hurt. Everything is your fault, Danny getting hurt mernalmost getting killed a number of times\" Allyson said counting onrnher fingers. Allrnof her augur Allyson had held inside for the past four years, everrnsince her parents had died came out in one simply yet most painfulrnsentence, she had ever spoken. \"It'srnyour fault Mom and Dad died Sara,\" Allyson cried sternly as shernstood up and went in to check on Danny. Sararnsat there unable to do anything as tears filled up in her eyes. Herrntears began to roll down her face, getting up with Allyson's wordsrnresounding in her ears --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Insidernof the nursing room Danny was lying on the bed with a bandage on hisrnwound. \"Hey,rnhow are you feeling?\" Allyson asked sitting in a chair beside thernbed. Danny sat up slowly saying, \"I'm fine, just a littlernshocked still. I mean finding out you're some kind of wizard andrnthen have a fire ball thrown at you not normal.\" \"You'rerntelling me I lived with Max for about three years. I don't knowrnabout the wizard stuff, but I do know about having fire balls thrownrnat you,\" Allyson grimly, but there was a smile on her face as shernlooked at Danny. \"YearnI guess that's true, but Ally why didn't tell anyone what he wasrndoing to you and Sara,\" Danny asked a questionably look on hisrnface. Allyson's eyes grew fearful, but when Danny put his hand onrnher knee and smiled at her she gained some strength. Sighingrnand looking at him directly she said, \"well Max wasn't...still isn't the personrnyou want to go against if you can help it. And sometimes he wouldrntorture me until I wished to die, but death would have been too goodrnfor me.\" \"Butrnwhat did you do to get so mad?\" \"Nothing,rnhe's just crazy and it wasn't even me he was mad at most of therntime, it was Sara, but because I had to play big sister I would takernher beatings for her,\" Allyson said her voice icy as she spoke. \"Butrnwhy?\" Danny asked again sitting up all the way now. Allyson lookedrnat him and her voice was, \"because that's what sisters do, but Irncan't believe I ever did it for her.\" \"Why?\" \"It'srnher fault my parents are died. They were going through a storm tornpick her up from a friends' house and a dunk loser ran a red lightrnand crashed into them and IT'S HER FAULT,\" Allyson yelled, butrnthen fall against Danny crying. Dannyrnstroked her hair saying, \"shh, it's alright. You know it wasn'trnher fault was dunk idiot's fault and you can't blame her.\" \"I…know,rnbut you don't know…the…the pain I've…been through…becausernof her…even if…it wasn't her fault,\" Allyson cried throughrnher tears her throat aching from all her crying. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Afterrna few minutes Allyson had calmed down and she was still sitting nextrnto Danny with his arm around her shoulder and stroking her hair withrnhis finger tips. \"Allyson?\"rnhe asked almost absent mindedly. \"Yea,rnwhat is it Danny?\" she asked pulling away slightly to look at him. \"Ally,rnwhere's Sara?\" \"Shernshould be outside waiting. Why?\" \"BecausernI don't… I don't… feel her out there,\" Danny said unsure. \"What,rnlike feeling her prense,\" Allyson asked. He nodded. Sighing Allysonrngot up and left to room to go check on Sara. Onlyrna few seconds later she came running back in almost yelling, \"she'srnGONE!\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hope you enjoyed that chapter Please review. More soon promise.[Chapter 16] Here's the next xhapter, hope you enjoy it. -------------------------------------------------------------- \"She's GONE!\" Allyson cried looking at Danny. \"Whatrndo you mean gone,\" Danny cried as he tried to stand up, but he fallrnto the floor. Allysonrnrun up and helped him up saying, \"I mean she's gone and the nurserndidn't know where she went…what if he found her?\" Dannyrnunderstood at once and said, \"we'll find her I promise, lets go.\" \"No,rnDanny you need your rest,\" Allyson said just like a mother with arnsick child. Danny gave a small chuckle at this, but said, \"Allysonrnit'll be easier with two people looking.\" \"Irndon't care Danny stay here and get better and besides you'rernprobably what Max really wants anyway,\" Allyson said sitting downrnnext to him. . \"Allyson,rnhe could kill you,\" Danny cried, gazing at her through concernedrneyes. Allyson starred back at him giving a nervous laugh as she said,rn\"If he could've done that, he would have done that a long timernago.\" \"Justrnpromise me I'll be careful Ally,\" he said gently. \"Irnwill I promise I love you Danny,\" she whispered. \"Irnlove you to Allyson,\" he said as he brought her into a kiss. Thernkiss only last a few seconds before Allyson pulled away saying, \"Irnshould get going.\" Dannyrnnodded letting her go. Moving towards the door she turned blew him arnkiss saying, \"be safe and rest Danny.\" \"Yourntoo Ally,\" Danny said blowing his own kiss to her. With that and arnsmall worried smile on her lips Allyson left the room and beganrnsearching for Sara. Shernbegan looking around school, but couldn't find her anywhere.rnFinally she sat down on a bench and thought of where she would go. \"She'srnnever really left Max's house so town is almost impossible, but-\" Then like a bomb it hit her, she only prayed she wasn't too late. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shernran as fast as she could to their house in the woods. She reached itrnin about 20 minutes and ran inside. It was empty, but someone hadrncome and trashed the place. All the work that had gone into makingrnthe place livable was gone. Shernstarred there and fall on her knees crying unable to control them.rnSuddenly she saw a piece of paper hanging on a broken nail stickingrnout. Whippingrnher tears away she picked up the note and read it, tears of augur andrnworminess now flowing down her face. Crumpling the note up andrnthrowing it to the ground she walked out of the house and began tornrun in the direction of her old house. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Itrntook her about ten minutes to get back to Max's house. Catching herrnbreath she walked up the stars slowly and pushed open the door.rnWalking inside she quietly closed the door and began looking around. Everything looked and felt the same except the door to Max's studyrnwas open. Goingrnover to it, she slowly pushed it opened and walked inside. The roomrnwas dark except for a reading lamp over looking a couch showing anrnunconscious Sara lying on it. \"Sara,\"rnAllyson cried as she ran up to her, but she stopped short as anrninvisible force field haled her back. \"Didrnyou really think it would be that easy Allyson,\" a cold voice saidrnfrom behind her. She spun around just as the door slammed shut andrnlights sprung on blinding her for a few seconds. Oncernher eyes had gotten used to the light she glared at Max. \"Whatrndo you want Max?\" Allyson asked unsure of what to do next. Maxrnstepped closer and held out his palm towards her. Allyson raised herrneye brow, but repeated, \"Let Sara go Max.\" \"Givernthis to Danny and I'll let her go Allyson,\" Max said looked atrnher his eyes a blazed with fire. \"Whatrnis it?\" Allyson asked taking a step back. \"It'srna ring for him Allyson and-\" \"Yearnboys now aren't big on getting jewelry from a girl Max,\" Allysonrncut him off putting her hands on her hips. Max didn't laugh, butrnwalked up to her and gripped her by the throat. Allyson's eyesrnfilled with fear and her hands fall to her side almost frozen inrnplace. \"Listenrnhere you bitch, give this ring your precious Danny or say good bye tornyour sister forever,\" Max growled his eyes glaring daggers at her. \"Whatrndoes it do,\" she said in between gasps for air, but Max onlyrngripped her harder. \"Dornwe have a deal my dear,\" Max said. Allysonrnfelt as if she was about to pass out, but nodded as tears flowed downrnher face. Maxrnreleased her and she collapsed to the floor breathing in oxygenrndeeply. She then stood up and turned to get Sara, but she was gone. \"Wherernis she?\" She asked confused and angry. Max smirked as he replied,rn\"Give this to Danny and I'll bring your sister back safe andrnsound.\" \"Butrnwhere is she Max,\" Allyson asked again through clenched teeth. Maxrnpicked up his remote and clicked it to a screen behind her. Allysonrnspun around and gasped. Sara was tied to a chair blindfolded andrngagged with fire balls closing in around her from all sides, movingrncloser with every second it seemed. \"You'drnbetter hurry if you want her to live Allyson \" Max said fromrnbehind her. Allysonrnglanced over his shoulder saying, \"touch one hair on her head Maxrnand the deals' off.\" Maxrndidn't say anything, but sent a fire ball and chair hurtlingrntowards Allyson. The chair shoved her to the floor and the fire ballrnburned her check. She could taste blood on the inside of her moth andrnthe burn on her check felt like acid. \"Ifrnyou ever talk to me like that again you butch you'll die first Irnpromise you that,\" Max yelled at her. Allysonrngot up, and moved past Max not meting his gaze, and left the room. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whenrnshe was gone, another door opened and a middle aged man came inside. \"Arernyou sure that it'll work,\" the man, Paul asked. Max turned andrnfaced him and smiled, \"Oh yes it'll work. As you know the wearerrnof the ring can't take it off themselves, so that won't be arnproblem.\" \"Whatrnabout Allyson?\" Paul asked. \"Oncernshe's done her job…she'll met the same fate as her worthless magical parents,\" Max sneered. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review. More soon I promise.[Chapter 17] Here's the next chapter. Hope you enjoy it. Also in this chapter something will be revealed if you have a guess at the end about it, DON'T put it INTO A REVIEW. please just PM with your guess if you have one. Hope you enjoy this chapter. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allysonrnfelt like bursting out in tears and running back and facing Max rightrnthen and there, but then Sara would get hurt. So, she kept herselfrntogether as she knocked softly on the door to Danny's house. Shernhad seen him walk inside a few moments ago so she knew he was inside. In arnfew seconds the door opened and Danny was there in front of her. \"Allyson,rnwhat are you doing here?\" he asked sensing her fear. She didn'trnsay anything, but fall against his chest and pulled him into a hug.rnHe hugged her back, but asked gently, \"Did you find Sara?\" \"a…nornI didn't,\" she lied hoping he would believe her. He must havernbecause he said, \"I'll help you look.\" \"Ohrnno you're not, Danny,\" his mom called from the kitchen as sherncame out towards the door. Coming up behind her son Mrs. Sinclairrnspotted Allyson and gave her a smile, \"Oh, hi Allyson I didn'trnrealize it was you, how are you?\" \"I'mrnfine Mrs. Sinclair,\" Allyson said pulling away from Danny. \"You'rernwelcome to stay for dinner,\" Mrs. Sinclair said with a smile on herrnface. Danny looked at his mom rolled his eyes, but said, \"yea comernon, you shouldn't me alone anyway.\" Allysonrnnodded and stepped inside closing the door behind her. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Afterrna few hours Danny and Allyson were sitting in Danny's room tryingrnto \"figure out\" where Sara was. \"Didrnyou see Max, Ally, I mean you said…hey Allyson are you listening tornme,\" Danny asked waving his hand in front of her face. Blinking andrncoming out of her thoughts she said, \"What is it Danny?' \"Yournwere starring off into space, you alright?\" he asked reallyrnconcerned. He shook her head and turned towards him. \"It'srnnothing Danny I was just thinking of this ring my real dad used tornwear and I just found it,\" she said calmly. \"Ohrncool can I see it,\" Danny asked. Allyson pulled out Max's ringrnand handed it to Danny. She didn't really look at it closely, butrnsaid, \"yeah my dad was wearing it week before he died, it was arnpresent from one of his students, he was a teacher.\" Dannyrnnodded and examined it allowing Allyson to sip into her own thoughtsrnagain. \"Thatrndidn't seem like a lie, but how could that not be a lie…unless,rnbut that's impossible,\" she thought shaking her head. \"It'srnquite beautiful,\" Danny said still almost transfixed by the ring.rnRemembering Max's words she stammered, \"Well …why don't, yournput it…on.\" \"Irncouldn't do that Ally, it's yours,\" Danny began, but Allysonrnshook her head. \"Takernit Danny, I'm giving it to you…it's too painful to have thatrnwith me,\" Allyson said almost not truly faking the tears coming tornher eyes. Dannyrnset the ring down on the bed and gave Allyson a shoulder hug sayingrnsoothingly, \"Hey, it's alright to cry…and I'd gladly take thernring…everything's alright.\" Allysonrnwhapped away her tears saying gently, \"Thanks Danny, that means arnlot to me.\" \"Nornproblem Ally, I love you so much to see you get hurt anymore,\"rnDanny said as he placed a kiss on her check. Justrnthen Mr. Sinclair came into the room saying, \"Hey kids it's timernfor bed…Allyson we set up the guest room down the hall for you,rnalright.\" \"ThanksrnMr. Sinclair,\" Allyson said a smile on her face. \"Goodrnnight then,\" Mr. Sinclair said leaving the room. \"Goodrnnight,\" both teenagers called out. \"Yournsure you alright,\" Danny said turning back to Allyson. She noddedrnand stood up yawning, \"yea, I'm tired Danny I'll see yourntomorrow alright?\" \"Alrightrnsleep well Ally, I love you,\" Danny said watching her walk to therndoor. Turningrnaround she gave him a worried smile as she said, \"I love toornDanny.\" Seeingrnher worry Danny reassured her, \"Don't worry Ally we'll find herrnI swear to you.\" Shernsimple nodded calling out a \"good night,\" as she left the room. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sleeprndidn't come easy that night. Her mind raced with Max's words andrnher conversation with Danny. She hadn't completely lied to him, butrnshe didn't understand where the thing with her dad had come from. That was the last thought before she finally slipped into a restlessrnslumber. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shernwas standing in her very old bedroom in her real parents' house. Itrnwas covered in light purple with flowers all around the place arnsingle compaie bed with white wood for the bed frame. Shernthen heard the door open and in came a ten year old girl. She had searngreen eyes and curly hair that reached to her waist. The girl wasrnfollowed in by a middle aged man. He had light brown hair and darkrnblue eyes with a wide happy smile on his face. \" Heyrnhow's my little princess?\" He asked picking the ten year oldrnAllyson up and swinging her around. The ten year old giggled andrnsmiled up at her father. \" Daddy,rnhow is your student doing?\" \" Veryrnwell honey.\" \" Daddy,rnwhy didn't I get magic like you?\" the ten year old pouted as bestrnas she could, but failed. Herrnfather laughed, but said, \"Sweetie it isn't my call who getsrnmagic and who does.\" \" Wellrnit should you're the greatest wizard in the world,\" the youngrnAllyson said looking up at him. \" Myrnstudent actually gave me a gift today you want to see,\" the manrnasked. Allyson ( both of them, even through the bigger Allyson, whorncouldn't be seen ) nodded. Pickingrnup the ten year old, her father sat down on the bed with his daughterrnin his lap. Making a gesture with his hands a box appeared hoveringrnin the sky for a few seconds and then it floated over to Allyson andrnlanded on her lap. \" Openrnit up Honey,\" the man said smiling. The ten year old opened it andrnstarred in amazement. In the box was a ring, Itrnwas made of an old iron and in the center was a red jewel with arnsymbol that she couldn't make out on it. \" It'srnbeautiful Daddy,\" the ten year old said as she slipped the ring onrnher dad's finger. \" It'srnpretty on you,\" the ten year old said. The man nodded in agreementrnand hugged his child tightly. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allysonrnfelt herself moving and soon found herself on a stage, but she hadrnnever been there. Then she saw her father on stage. He was doing onrnhis tricks that he had done many times before. He had lifted a weightrnover his head was letting it his head. Yet there was somethingrndifferent about him. Hernlooked weaken, not entirely noticeable, but it was there. It lookedrnto have been a few days after the last portion of the dream. Justrnas he was taking a bow the weight began to fall. Allyson screamed,rn\"Dad look out,\" but it didn't work. She watched in horror asrnher father was killed. Oncernagain she felt herself moving, only this time it was to a dark roomrnwith no light and only one picture played in her mind, the ring. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allysonrnbolted up in bed. She was sweating and chills ran up her spine. Therernwas something about the ring, but she couldn't tell what it was.rnTaking deep breaths she lied back down, but was unable to get back tornsleep. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ More soon I promise. Please review, but if you have an idea of who the father is please don't put it in the review, just PM me with your guess alright. Thanks More soon I promise.[Chapter 18] Here's the next chapter. Once agin any thoughts on who the father is please DON'T PUT IT IN A REVIEW. Just Pm me instead alright. Hope you enjoy thies chapter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thernnext morning, Danny came downstairs to find Allyson already up with arnbowl of cereal. \"Hey,rnyour up early. Did you have a good night sleep?\" he asked going tornthe fried and getting himself a glass of milk. Allysonrndidn't look up at him, simply said, \"Your parents already left,rnthey said they'd be back late.\" \"Alright,rnbut was the bed to hard or something?\" he asked sitting down acrossrnfrom her. She took another spun full of cereal and didn't looked uprnat him. Sighing he reached out and put his hand on hers, his thumbrnrubbing her wrist gently. At this she glanced down at his hand andrnthen back up at him. Herrnface was tear-washed and there was the beginning of dark circlesrnunder her eyes. \"Ally,rnwhat happened, did he come in the middle of the night?\" Danny askedrnconcern and worry written all over his face. \"It'srnnothing Danny…I was just having some weird dreams last night…Irnmean really weird,\" she said starring at him directly. Dannyrnwas just about to say something when the front door opened. Jumpingrnup Danny mouthed, \"stay here,\" before walking out of the kitchenrnto the front hall. In arnfew seconds Allyson heard a shocked Danny, \"Mom what are you doingrnhere?\" Atrnthis Allyson took off running towards the front hall and stopped inrnher tracks as she also asked, \"What are you doing here; I thoughtrnyou had work Mrs. Sinclair.\" \"Sorndid I, and in away I still I'm,\" Mrs. Sinclair said smiling atrnthe two teenagers. Danny raised his eyebrow asking, \"What are yourntalking about Mom?\" \"Well,rnas you know Danny I work for Restate Company and they just gave me arnnew job. It's looking over an old mansion in New Orleans…it'srncalled the Magic Mansion,\" Mrs. Sinclair said reading it from herrnnotes. Thenrnlooking up at the two teenagers she asked, \"Would you both like torncome?\" \"Whatrnabout Dad?\" \"He'llrnbe coming soon, so what do you say.\" Dannyrnand Allyson looked at each other before nodding their heads at thernsame time. \"Great,rnwell be leaving in about two hours,\" Mrs. Sinclair said moving pastrnthem and heading fro the kitchen. Afterrnhis mom left, Danny turned towards Allyson saying in a hushed tone,rn\"What about Max and Sara?\" Allyson'srnsmiled faded slightly as she said, \"Don't worry we'll findrnthem…but right now it's time to pack.\" With that she darted uprnthe stairs and began packing. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MeanwhilernMax was watching this from his crystal ball. He chuckled slightly asrnhe watched Danny and Allyson pack. He had heard Danny's moms' plans aboutrnto going to the Magic Mansion and he laughed. \"Danny,rnyou're so mine now,\" Max sneered. Then looking at Allyson he smirked evilly,rn\"So history will repeat itself…for the Mansion is indeed where it beganrnand where your sister and you will die Allyson… as your parentsrnbefore you.\" Hernturned away from the ball, snapped his fingers and disappeared in arncloud of smoke. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter ,please review. and remeber about the Dad thing. More soon I promise. Hope you enjoyed this chapter.[Chapter 19] Here's the next chapter. Hope you enjoy. Also if you have any thoughts on who the dad is Pm, DON'T PUT IT IN A review. Hope you enjoy this chapter. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Allyson,rndon't you want to call your parents?\" Mr. Sinclair asked as shernand Danny came downstairs with their things. \"My…parents,\"rnshe said glancing over at Danny for help. Danny noticed and said,rn\"I'll be right back I have to go to the bathroom.\" With that hernleft the room, leaving Allyson alone with his parents. DialingrnDanny's cell phone she played the game of make believe. Finallyrnafter what seemed like forever she hung up the phone saying, \"Hernsaid it was alright.\" BothrnMr. and Mrs. Sinclair smiled and all of them headed out the door. So,rnafter about six hours from packing, to the plane ride, to the gettingrninto a cab heading for the mansion. Climbing out of the cab Mrs.rnSinclair gawked at it speechless as the other climbed out too.rnDanny's jaw had dropped almost done to the ground, as he starred atrnthe castle in amazement. Hernglanced off at Allyson, excepting her to look the same, but her facernwas passive of any emotion. \"Ally,rnyou alright?\" he asked turning towards her. Yet she didn't sayrnanything just walked past him without turning to even look at him. Atrnthis Danny raised his eyebrow and ran after her calling, \"Allyson,rnAlly…hold on, is something wrong?\" \"NothingrnDanny, I'm just worried about Sara.\" said Allyson turning tornlook at him, not meting his eyes. \"Irnknow, but we will find her, now come on.\" Danny said as herntugged her back over to his parents. Allyson bit her lip and smiledrnand followed Danny back. \"Alright as soon as we get our rooms, you guys can go take arnlook around.\" said Mrs. Sinclair. \"Don'trnget lost.\" chuckled Mr. Sinclair. After arriving to their rooms,rnthey unpacked and were ready to go. \"So,rnwhere should we start?\" Danny asked. \"Irndon't know Danny…lets just wonder around,\" Allyson said as theyrnwalked down a large flat of stairs from their rooms. He nodded, butrnthen asked, \"Ally, are you sure you're ok?\" \"Yea,rntrust me Danny, I'm fine,\" she said giving him a fake smile.rnKnowing that she didn't want to talk Danny let it go and they beganrnwondering around the mansion. Hisrnparents were busy with Mrs. Sinclair's company, so the teenagersrnwere left to themselves. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Theyrnwondered around for about an hour, before taking a break. Danny wasrnamazed at everything he saw, but Allyson seemed to be holding backrntears and the rest of her facial features were passive. Sittingrndown in a chair in one of the many hallways Danny asked overwhelmedrnwith excitement, \"Isn't this amazing?\" \"Yea,rnit is,\" Allyson said, but her voice held little excitement. Dannyrnturned and looked at her, \"You're really worried about yourrnsister aren't you?\" Shernnodded, but said nothing else except, \"Do you still have the ring Irngave you Danny?\" \"Yea,rnright here,\" Danny said holding out his head with his palm openrntowards her. The ring was lying in it untouched. She nodded, got uprnand walked off down the hall, with Danny confused following afterrnher. \"HeyrnAlly, wait up…where are you?-\" Hernstopped when Allyson stopped died in her tracks. She had come to arnroom, that they hadn't yet been in and she was gawking at it in arnmixture of confusion and fear. It was a theater, with a tables andrnchairs stationed all around and a stage in the center of the room. \"Allyson,rnwhat's wrong?\" Danny asked from behind her, but she didn'trnanswer. Her vision had gotten blurry and she was in her dream again. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shernsaw her father on stage. He was doing on his tricks that he had donernmany times before. Just as he was taking a bow the weight began tornfall. Allyson screamed, \"Dad look out,\" but it didn't work. Shernwatched in horror as her father was killed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Dad,rnno,\" she screamed out loud as her vision cleared and she foundrnherself looking into Danny's blue eyes. He was shacking herrnslightly, but stopped when he saw her eyes clear. \"Ally,rnwhat happened?\" he asked really worried starring at her intently.rnShe blinked and asked, \"didn't you see that Danny?\" \"Seernwhat Ally?\" he asked no taking his eyes off of her. Allyson lookedrnat him, but pulled away from his grasp whispering, \"He was here,rnbut how?\" \"Whornwas here?\" Danny asked taking a step towards her. She looked atrnhim, glanced around the room for a few moments before turning andrnrunning down the hall back towards her room. Danny ran after her calling out of her to stop, but she ignored him. Allyson reached her room, locked the door and flung herself on her bed. She heard Danny kncking at her door, but ignored her once more. She could hear his pleas for her to come out, but she didn't even respond. Finally he left her alone Alone at last she allowed her thoughts to overwhelm her and she cried into her pillow. Soon she had cried herself to sleep, allowing her dreams, even if only for a few hours to carry her away from all the pain she had been holding inside her whole life ever since her parents had passed away. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hope you enjoyed this chapter, please review. More soon I promise[Chapter 20] Here's the next chapter, I hope you enjoy it. Some lines and the scence is bassed off of a scence from the movie, so the iedas belong to Disney, not me. Hope you enjoy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Laternthe next morning, Allyson awoke from her dreams. They had been thernsame one she had had a two nights in a row. Rolling onto her side shernmoaned quietly to herself. Just then she heard a knock at her door.rnStill half asleep she said, \"Please…just a few more minutes…Max.\" \"Ally,rnit's me Danny,\" he called through the door. Groaning andrnmumbling slightly she got up, walked over and opened the door.rnRobbing her eyes she asked, \"yea, what is it Danny?\" \"Irnjust wanted to make sure you were alright,\" he said taking a steprncloser. \"I'mrnfine really, but why did you have to wake me up at seven?\" \"Ally,rnit's almost nine, are you sure you're alright?\" he askedrnbringing his hand to her forehead to check her temperature. \"I'mrnfine Danny, I just have a lot on my mind,\" she said taking his handrnaway and holding it in her hand. Danny nodded saying, \"Well, yournknow you can always come to me for anything, right.\" Shernnodded and was about to say something, when Mrs. Sinclair came uprnsaying, \"Yea Danny would you mind helping me move some stuff itrnshouldn't take to long….hey Allyson we missed you at dinner lastrnnight.\" \"Yearnsorry I wasn't feeling well sorry,\" Allyson answered glancing atrnDanny. \"Butrnyou're alright now?\" Mrs. Sinclair asked. Allyson nodded and Mrs.rnSinclair left with Danny following after her. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whatrnwouldn't take long at all turned into a four hour job. \"Mom,rnam I done?\" Danny asked moving the last of the stuff. Mrs. Sinclairrndidn't look up from her chart, but nodded. Danny quickly ran off tornfind Allyson, but he couldn't find her anyway. Justrnthen he saw his dad coming down the hall with another load of stuff. \"HeyrnDad, have you seen Allyson?\" Danny asked going up to him. \"Yea…Irnthink I saw her in the lullaby,\" Mr. Sinclair said putting thernstuff down, \"would you mind helping me.\" He stopped when Dannyrnhad already started running down the hall. Allysonrnwas indeed in the lullaby. She was sitting at a table a pile of booksrnaround her and she was flipping through one of them. Her face lookedrnintense as her eyes scanned over the pages. Moving behind a pillarrnand moving towards her quietly he put his heads on her shouldersrnsaying, \"BOO.\" Allysonrnnearly jumped out of her sit as she turned and faced him. \"Don'trndo that Danny,\" she yelled, before resuming her seat. Dannyrnlooked down and mumbled, \"Sorry…what are you doing?\" \"Notrnthat it concerns you, but my dream was really gotten to me and I'mrntrying to fringe it out,\" she said not looking up at him. Dannyrnraised his eye brows at her saying, \"Trying to figure out a dreamrnwith books?\" \"Well…yea,rnsee I think I've been here before only I don't know why and I'mrntrying to find some names of who owned this last, I mean it had to bernsomeone magical, right\" she said flipping thought the pages. \"Wellrnmaybe Max owned it,\" Danny said trying to make it a joke, butrnAllyson just starred at him coolly. He stopped and said, \"um, needrnany help?\" \"Yea,rnum just stat looking though the books,\" she said gesturing all thernbooks around her. Pickingrnup a book and looking at it he mused to himself, \"That's odd.\" \"What?\"rnshe asked looking up at him. He starred at the books binding beforernspeaking again, \"It's just that some of the books have weirdrnmarking on them.\" Allysonrntook the book from him and looked it over. After a few moments ofrnexamining the book and looking at other book around her she turned tornhim saying, \"You're right Danny…look at these marking, therernshould be more of them right?\" \"Right?\"rnhe said not sure where she was going with this. \"Well,rnlets find them,\" she said and began walking over to an ale ofrnbooks. Arnfew minutes later books were on a pile on the table. Danny stood backrnsaying, \"Alright now what?\" \"Ifrnthis is true, I think this is a puzzle and now all we have to do isrnsolve it,\" Allyson said taking the first book from the pile andrnlooking at the binding. A few more minutes passed, before both teensrnstepped back and looked at the books. \"Allyson,rnlook, but where is it?\" Danny said amazed. It was a picture of twornserpents starring at each other. Allyson looked at it and thenrnsomething clicked in her mind. Pulling out a blue print of thernmansion she soon found what she was looking for. \"Yournmean that?\" she said pointing to a spot on the map. \"Whatrnare we doing here, lets go,\" Danny said running to the door, withrnAllyson following at his heels. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Aboutrnan hour later they stood in front of the symbol. \"Any ideas?\"rnDanny asked holding the flashlight. Allyson shook her head thinking,rnhard. Her eyes looked down at the bottom and words starred back atrnher. \"Danny,rnthere,\" she said pointing them out to him. Danny shone the light onrnthem trying to read them, but finally shook his head, \"I think it'srnLatin I have no idea what it says.\" Dannyrnstepped back and yet Allyson try. Allyson ran her fingers under thernletters and the words seemed to roll off her tongue with out even andrnonce of trouble. Whenrnshe was done she stepped back. Danny starred at her and was about tornsay something when the wall beside him opened. Startledrnthey both jumped back. \"How did you do that Ally?\" Allysonrnlooked back at Danny just as shocked and said, \"I don't know.\" \"Well,rnlets find out,\" Danny said moving inside of the room. Dannyrnstepped inside followed by Allyson. It was tunnel almost and a vaultrndoor was in one side of the wall. \"Thisrnis pretty creepy,\" Allyson said looking around. Danny was starringrnat the vault and began turning it quietly listening. Finally he heardrna click and began to pull the vault open. Allyson starred at himrnshocked as she said, \"How did you do that?\" \"Thatrnwas a lot of practice,\" he said smirking at her. As he pulled thernvault open the secret door slammed closed causing Allyson to jumprnaround screaming. Dannyrntook no notice, but looked inside of the vault saying, \"Ally, yournhave to see this,\" as he began to crawl through into the room. Therntwo came into the room looking around in wonder. Danny started tornlook at the books lining the halls. Allyson stood in the entrance andrnstarred at the room in wonder. \"Yournalright?\" Danny asked turning to look at her. Allyson turned andrnlloked at him and began to walk farther into the room saying, \"Yea…rnI know this is going to sound crazy, but-\" Beforernshe could finish her sentence both them fall throw the room andrnlanded back on the lubbary floor. \"Ok,rndid you do something Danny?\" Allyson asked sitting up. \"No,rnbut that was pretty cool, anyway what were you saying?\" he askedrngetting up on his knees. \"It'srnjust that,\" she began, but Mrs. Sinclair walked in at that moment. \"Whatrnare you kids doing here?\" Mrs. Sinclair asked shaking at head. \"Nothing,\"rnDanny said standing up, \"can you get some food I'm starving.\" \"Sure,\"rnMrs. Sinclair said. Danny followed his mom out, but then turned andrnlooked at Allyson. She was looking around and seemed to be looking atrnsomething. \"HeyrnAlly, you coming,\" he called over to her. She turned, looked backrnonce more and then ran up to catch him. Asrnthe two left the library, Max stepped out from the shadows smirking.rn\"So, it seems he was wrong, she does have the gift as well…wellrnshe'll be out of my way soon enough.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hope you enjoyed this chapter, Please review, more soon I promise.[Chapter 21] Here's the next chapter. It's short, but good, I hope you enjoy. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lunchrnwas quiet, that day, with everyone thinking their own thoughts. Manyrntimes Danny would glance up at Allyson, but she wouldn't meet hisrngaze, but he knew that she was aware of him watching her. Once hisrnparents had left, Danny turned to Allyson asking, \"Hey, you ok?\" Stillrnshe wouldn't look at him, but said, \"Do you think Sara's okrnDanny?\" \"Oh,rnAlly is that's what's been bothering you?\" Danny asked bringingrnher into a side hug. She leaned against his chest slightly as hernbegan to run his fingers gently through her hair. Tears began tornroll down her face as she sobbed, \"Her and just everything withrnMax…\" her voice trailed off as she sobbed harder. \"Shhh,rnI promise you, I won't hurt you ever again and we'll find Sara,\"rnDanny reassured her as her hugged her more tightly. She sobbedrnharder and buried her face in his chest. Afterrna few moments her sobs had become whimpers and she pushed herselfrnback up. \"Yournalright?\" Danny asked, as he whapped away the few remaining tearsrnwith his index finger. She nodded, but then said, \"I think I'mrngoing to go take a nap, is that ok Danny?\" \"Ofrncourse Ally,\" he said giving her a small smile and patting her onrnthe back. Allyson stood up and left the room, leaving Danny sittingrnby himself. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allyson reached her room in a few minutes. Going to the bathroom andrnwashing up she sighed as she looked herself in the mirror. Shernlooked like herself as a ten year old again, lost, scared confused,rnwith almost no one to turn too. Shernwalked back into her room, closed the door and turned around slowlyrnlooking at the ground. Just then she felt a small fire ball hit inrnher the arm. Spinning around she saw Max standing just a few feetrnaway from her. Holding her hand over her bruised arm she starred atrnhim, fear in her eyes and her whole body had began trembling. Maxrnsmirked at her as he took a step towards her, \"Well, if it isn'trnthe abounding bitch herself.\" \"What,rnare you talking about Max?\" she asked her voice trembling slightly. \"Dornyou not remember our deal Allyson?\" he asked taking yet anotherrnstep towards her. \"Sara…yournbetter not have hurt her Max,\" Allyson said trying to sound brave,rneven thought inside she was terrified. Hernshook his head giving her an evil grin. Allyson backed up, but shernfound herself cornered. Shernwas about to scream, but Max gripped his hand over her mouth. \"Irndon't think so Allyson, Danny's not going to safe you this time,\"rnMax sneered moving closer to her. \"Danny,rnplease I need you,\" she thought to herself. Max laughed as hernremoved his hand from her mouth and began to chock her. \"Yournthink Danny can save you bitch, he doesn't care about you…justrnlike your father,\" he sneered as he turned around and sent herrnflying onto her bed. Nextrnhe sent fireballs at her. She held up her arms to protect herself,rnbut in vain. He shot them all over her. Her jeans burned up until itrnreached just above her knees, her sleeves were burned off and thernshirt was ripped until it reached to her bra line. She screamed atrnthe top of her lungs, but no one came…she was all alone. Finallyrnhe stopped saying, \"Danny better have that ring on his fingerrntonight, or else you'll be sorry.\" Allysonrnnodded slowly. Max turned t leave muttering under his breath, \"You'rernno better than your father,\" before he disappeared. Allyson starred atrnthe spot where Max had been her whole body was aching and bleeding. Yet, no tears fall, she was too tired and scared to cry any. Shernfall against the bed, darkness taking over her, just as the doorrnopened. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed that chapter, please review. More soon I promise[Chapter 22] Here's the next chapter, I hope you enjoy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- She woke up, her headrnpounding and her body felt like it was on fire. Just then she felt arncool cloth being whipped over her forehead and her felt the coversrnover her. Her eyes felt as if they were pinned shut, slowly shernforced then open. Uponrnopening them, she saw Danny sitting at her side on the bed, with arncloth in his hand. Seeing her awake hernsaid gently, \"Oh, thank god Ally, how do you feel?\" \"Like I'm burningrnup,\" she said her voice just above a whisper. He nodded as hernlaid the cloth over her forehead. \"I can onlyrnimagine, what happened Allyson?\" he asked looking at herrndirectly in the eyes. She tried to sit up, but he laid a hand on herrnshoulder and gentle held her down saying, \"Oh, no you're notrngetting up an time soon missy, now what happened.\" Allyson sighed, butrnthen tears began to flow down her face as she cried, \"it wasrnMax,\" before her groaned in pain. Danny brushed her tears awayrnsaying, \"Oh, Ally, I'm so sorry…I didn't know he had foundrnyou…it'll-you'll be ok, I swear I'll make him pay.\" . Danny was takenrnaback, but said gently, \"cause…you're my friend and I care andrnlove you.\" \"Oh,\" was allrnshe could say as she turned away from him slightly. There was an oxrnward silence for a few seconds between them. Finally Danny said,rn\"Did he say anything to you about Sara or what he wanted?\" \"No…he didn't,rnbut…,\" her voice trailed off as more tears escaped her. Dannyrnbrushed her hair away saying, \"Shh, it'll be alright…now I'llrnbe right back ok,\" as he stood up from beside her. \"Where are yourngoing,\" she cried her voice holding fear and unsure ness in itrnas she reached up and grabbed his hand. Danny turned, looked down atrnher hand and then at her, with confused eyes. Taking his hand awayrnfrom her grasp, he said, \"I'll be right back Ally, I promise Irnjust have to tell my parents you're awake and alight, ok.\" \"Right, becausernI'm perfectly well,\" Allyson said with raised eye brows. Dannyrnlaughed and said, \"You know what I mean, I'll be right back,rnrest and don't go anywhere ok.\" \"Yearnok, I really don't think it's possible for me to move right now,\"rnshe said trying to makerna joke, but fear and sadness was heard in her voice. Danny sighedrnsaying, \"look I just have to tall my parents that your awoke andrnok…ok?\" \"Yearnfine,\" she said looking at him with fearful eyes. Danny nodded, andrnquietly slipped out the door closing it, but mot all the way. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Allysonrntried to get comfortable, but nothing worked. Breathing slowly in andrnout she thought of Max's words about Danny and her father. Atrnthe thought of her father a warm and safely feeling came over her andrnshe felt her body grow warm, but it was the type of warm of hope andrnlove. It lasted for a few seconds, but then vanished. Sighing shernturned onto her side just as Danny came back into the room. \"Heyrnmy parents are busy-wow Ally you're healed,\" Danny exclaimedrnhappily and confused. Allysonrnlooked him asking, \"What are you talking about Danny?\" Hernwalked towards her and handed her the mirror on from her bedsiderntable. She took it and starred into it. He was right. She wasrncompletely healed; they're no burns or scars that say she had beenrnattacked by anything. \"Ok,rnI know I didn't have anything to do with this,\" Danny said stillrnstarring at her in amazement. She turned and looked at him askingrnwith her eyes, \"but how?\" \"Irndon't know, but as long as you're ok that's all that matters,\"rnhe said taking the mirror from her. As Allyson looked at him Max'srnwords popped into her head and she shivered. \"MaybernI spoke to soon,\" he said putting a hand on her shoulder. \"I'mrnfine, but Danny do you still have my dad's ring?\" she askedrnpulling away slightly. Danny nodded slightly pulling the ring out ofrnhis pocket and handing it to her. Shernlooked at it and then took Danny's hand and looking at him in thernyes she slipped the ring on his finger. In her mind she was crying,rn\"please forgive me Danny.\" Outrnloud she said, \"it suits you Danny.\" \"Yournthink so,\" he said looking down at the ring and pulling his handrnaway. \"Yea…nowrncan we get something to eat, I'm starving,\" she said standing uprnfrom bed. Dannyrnsmiled at her saying, \"Of course.\" He held out his hand andrntogether they left the room, hand in hand. Neither of them noticedrnMax smirking from the shadows at them. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter I know it's short, but I delated the thing was orginally going to put in by mistake.

When Mrs. Sinclair releasedrnher, Mr. Sinclair came up and patted her on the back. \"Wellrnit must have been a pretty bad head ache, Danny wouldn't let usrncame in or call the doctor…it was like something was so wrong thatrnnot even doctors could fix it.\" Givingrna nervous laugh she said, \"Oh Danny was over exaggerating weren'trnyou Danny.\" \"A,rnyeah but I do that a lot, but you're ok so no be deal,\" he saidrnquickly. Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair nodded their heads, turning to go, butrnthen Mrs. Sinclair turned back around. \"Oh,rnAllyson Danny said you were looking for some information about thernhistory of this place…I asked my boss and he gave me theserndocuments on the founding of this place and stuff. It's reallyrnquite interesting,\" she said handing over a yellow file full ofrnloose papers to Allyson. Allyson took them nodding her thanks tornMrs. Sinclair. Both teenagers watched as the adults left. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Oncernthey were gone, Allyson turned placing a hand on her hip as shernsaid, \"A head ache and you wouldn't let them call the doctors,rnreally smooth Danny.\" \"Well,rnI don't think doctors or my parents would believe the truth,\" hernsaid looking at in the eye. She rolled her eyes saying, \"yea Irnguess you're right…so why don't we take a look at these.\" Sherntook off towards the library with Danny following behind her saying,rn\"you sure you're ok Ally?\" \"Stoprnworrying Danny I'm fine…now came on,\" she said picking up pacernslightly. They walked the rest of the way in silence and didn'trnspeak again until they were looking through the documents. \"Wow,rnthat's cool,\" Allyson said reading a packet of information.rnTurning to look at her he asked, \"What is it?\" Allysonrncleared her thought and read. \"Antonio Demilo, a world famousrnmagician founded this very mansion at age 35. He and his wife livedrnhere for a few years, before settling down with a family, leaving thernmagic mansion open for tourists.\" \"Cool,rnany news on the family?\" he asked as he went back to his ownrndocuments in front of him. Allyson scanned the information on thernpage before shaking her head and then turning to look at Danny. \"Yournfind anything?\" she asked. He didn't say anything for a fewrnseconds, but then his face went pale and his eyes grew wide withrnconfusion. \"That's impossible...there's no way,\" he muttered to himself. \"What?\" \"ohrnnothing…just a small little thing nothing to worry about,\" hernsaid covering up the documents. Allysonrnturned and looked at him saying, \"Come on Danny it could berninteresting come on tell me.\" She made a puppy dog pout at him, butrnhe wouldn't give in. Finally giving up she said, \"ok you win, butrnplease promise me you'll tell me at some point ok.\" \"Sure,rnbut not now, so where do you want to go for dinner, my parents arerngoing out with my mom's company tonight, so it's just us,\" hernsaid a small smile on his lips. She returned the smile saying, \"Irndon't know…but we could go look around the city.\" \"That'srncool, lets go,\" he said standing up. \"Ok,rnlet me go get ready,\" she said standing up and starting to walk outrnof the library. Danny watched her go. When she was gone, Danny turnedrnback to the table, picked up the document, folded it up and stuck itrnin his pocket. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Allysonrnreached her room; she was reaching for the door, but hesitated. Thernpain Max had put her through flew into her mind. Slowly andrncarefully, she opened the door and slipped inside, but didn't closernthe door all the way. Turning around she let out a sigh of relief.rnYet, just then a noise came from behind her. Spinningrnaround she saw a person, who caused tears to fall down her face withrnjoy in her heart. Opening her arms the figure ran into them andrncried, \"Ally…\" Allysonrnhugged her tightly as she whispered, \"Sara, you're alright.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed that chapter, Please review, more soon I promise. PLEASE REVIEW.[Chapter 24] Here's the next chapter, hope you enjoy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Last time Spinningrnaround she saw a person, who caused tears to fall down her face withrnjoy in her heart. Opening her arms the figure ran into them andrncried, \"Ally…\" Allysonrnhugged her tightly as she whispered, \"Sara, you're alright.\" -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"You ok, Sara?\" Allyson asked through her sobs as she hugged herrnsister tightly. Sara returned both the tears and the hug to her bigrnsister, her protector. After a few moments, Sara's sobs reduced tornwhimpers. \"It…it was horrible…Ally, he was…he…\" her voice trailedrnoff as more tears rolled down her face. \"Shh,rnit's ok Sara, you're safe…he wouldn't harm you again…I'mrnso sorry for getting mad at you…I didn't mean any of it?\"rnAllyson said softly stroking her sister's hair and kissing the toprnof her head. Arnfew more minutes passed before Allyson remembered that Danny wasrnwaiting for her down stairs. \"Sweetie,rnI hate to say this, but Danny's waiting for us…we had planned torngo out to dinner,\" Allyson said moving to stand up. Sara let herrnsister stand, but then almost clung to her all the way down stairs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finallyrnthey reached the grand entrance with Danny waiting there. When he sawrnthe two walking up to him, his eyes grew wide and he ran up to bothrnof them. \"Oh,rnSara you're back, but how?\" he asked picking her up and huggingrnher tightly. \"I'mrnfine Danny…how are you?\" Sara asked looking at him directly inrnthe eyes. He nodded, but glanced at Allyson asking with his eyes,rn\"How the heck did she get here?\" Shernshrugged saying, \"I have no clue, but can we get something to eat?\" Dannyrnlaughed as he placed Sara back down on the ground saying, \"Ofrncourse, but don't you think we should stay here and\" \"ActuallyrnI think getting away from here would be the best,\" Sara saidrnlooking from Allyson to Danny and back again. \"Arernyou sure Sara?\" Allyson asked. Her little sister nodded givingrnAllyson a small smile. \"Ok…sornany place you want to go Sara,\" her sister asked returning thernsmile. Sara thought for a few seconds before saying, \"Apple Bees!\" \"ApplernBees it is than,\" Allyson said laughing slightly. Danny nodded inrnagreement smiling down at Sara. So together the trio went out torndinner. Dinner,rnlike lunch was quiet, but it was also a little oxward with Sararnthere. Neither Allyson or Danny, who what she had gone though, andrnAllyson and Danny had gotten a little closer over the past days. Theyrnmade light conversation, but when the bill came something oddrnhappened to Sara. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dannyrnhad taken the bill from the waiter and was pulling out the money whenrnSara gasped. Turning to look at her Allyson asked, \"What is itrnSara?\" Sararndidn't say anything, but pointed to the ring on Danny's fingerrnher eyes wide with fear. With out saying a word, she got up from therntable and left the restant. \"Sararnget back here,\" Allyson cried after getting up herself andrnfollowing her sister out. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ OutsidernAllyson found Sara on a bench looking down at the ground. Quietly shernwalked up asking, \"Sara, why did you run off like that?\" Sararnsaid nothing, but looked up at Allyson with tears in her eyes.rnSitting down next to her, Allyson pulled her into a hug saying, \"Shh,rnit's alright Honey…you're safe now, but why did you flip outrnlike that back there?\" \"Thernring,\" Sara whimpered, so quietly, that Allyson wasn't sure ifrnshe heard right. \"thernring?\" Allyson asked. Sararnnodded as she pushed herself up straight again. \"Yea, it belongsrnMax and according to him…\" her voice trailed off. \"Accordingrnto him what?\" Allyson asked a little scared now. Sara turned andrnlooked at her sister directly in the eye saying, \"according tornhim…it kills wizard, like Danny.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed that chapter, more soon I promise, please review. THANKS[Chapter 25] Here's the next chapter, hope you enjoy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sara turned andrnlooked at her sister directly in the eye saying, \"according tornhim…it kills wizard, like Danny.\" Allysonrnsat speechless as her sisters' words replayed over and over in herrnears. Sara watched her older sister as tears of augur and sadnessrnfall down her face. Sara placed her hand on Allyson's shaking armrnsaying softly, \"Ally…it's ok…I'm sure you didn't know,rnit's not to late.\" Allysonrndidn't look at her, but shook her head and lowered her head to thernground. When she did speak her voice was filled with tears, \"That'srnjust it Sara…I did know, well kind of. Max came into my room at thernmansion and almost killed me. Saying that if I didn't give Dannyrnthe ring that he would kill you or me…I didn't have any choice.\" \"Didn'trnhave a choice,\" a shocked voice said from a few feet away fromrnthem. Allyson spun around and saw Danny standing there, augur andrnbetrayal in his eyes as he starred at the two sisters. Allysonrnstood up saying softly, \"Danny, it's not what you think?\" \"Ohrnreally so you didn't just say you wanted to see me get hurt,\"rnDanny said crossing his arms. Allysonrncried out in desperation, \"You don't understand-\" \"OhrnI understand Ally…I understand it all, you don't care about me atrnall, you only care about your sister and yourself,\" Danny saidrnturning on his heel and began walking away from them. Allyson ranrnafter him calling after him, but he ignored her and kept walking. \"Dannyrnwait,\" Allyson called after him holding her hand out to stop him.rnJust then a tree branch broke off and landed in front of him,rnstopping Danny's in his tracks for a few seconds. Dannyrnturned around and starred at her in shock. Allyson didn't know whatrnto do, she just starred back in fear and confusion at Danny. Sararncame up to them looking from one to the other. \"What…whatrnhappened?\" Allyson muttered to herself as she quickly pulled herrnarm back down. Danny didn't say anything, but stood there, hisrneyes growing wide. Afterrna few seconds of silence he said, \"Were you always planning onrnkilling me?\" Allysonrnwas still in shock that she didn't even respond to him. Sara triedrnto say something, but Danny just turned and ran down the street. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sararnwatched him go, with out saying anything. \"Whatrnwas that Ally,\" she asked turning around to face her sister.rnAllyson blinked bringing her back to reality and she looked down atrnher sister, shaking her head. \"I really don't know Sara…Irnreally don't,\" she said quietly fear creeping into her words. Sararndidn't know what to say, but went up and hugged her sister tightly. At this, Allyson allowed her fear to consume her and she fall to thernground with tears fall down her face, like a great waterfall. Sararnhugged her sister tightly, but inside she was scared. She had neverrnseen her sister so afraid or variable before and it terrified her. Arnlong time passed with both sisters just sitting there unable to movernor do anything. Finally, Allyson picked herself up from the ground,rnbrushing her tears away saying, \"it's getting late Sara, time forrnyou to go to bed.\" Sararnstood up and looked at her sister saying, \"you're the one whornjust collapsed into tears and might be a witch\" \"Yea,rnright Sara…even Dada said that would be impossible,\" Allyson saidrnlooking at Sara in the eyes. \"Whatever,rnyou just had this odd stuff happen to you and you're worried aboutrnme,\" Sara said. Allyson had to give a small smile at her sister asrnshe replied, \"Yep, now come on it's getting late.\" Sararnrolled her eyes at her sister, but took her hand and the two beganrnwalking back to the mansion.[Chapter 26] Here's the next chapter hope you Enjoy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Laterrnthat night, Allyson tossed and turned in her half-sleep state.rnFinally she couldn't take it anymore. After she and Sara had gottenrnback Danny had been in his room and wouldn't let anyone inside. Sighingrnshe slowly she got up and walked outside of her room, quietly makingrnher way down the hall to Danny's room. Takingrna deep breath she raised her arm and began knocking on the doorrncalling out, \"Danny, Danny please I really didn't mean anythingrnby what happened earlier…I'm sorry if I hurt you, but I…\" Herrnvoice trailed off as she realized that Danny wasn't going to talkrnto her. Letting out air, she turned and was just about to walk backrnto her room, when she heard the door open. \"Well,rnif you didn't mean any of it, then what did you mean exactly,\"rnDanny asked from behind her. Not turning to look at him she said, \"Irnmeant that Max-\" \"Oh,rndon't blame all of this on him Allyson,\" Danny said his voicernrising in volume slightly. At this, she turned around glaring at himrnher voice also rising, \"oh, why not? You know it's true.\" \"So,rnyour lying to me was because of him?\" Danny said his eyebrowsrnrising. \"No,rnbut I did it to safe my sisters' life, did you forget about herrnDanny.\" \"So,rnyour sisters' life is more important to you then mine?\" Dannyrnsaid taking a step towards her. Yet, Allyson stood her ground as shernstarred back at him sternly. \"Ofrncourse not, but Max\" \"Wouldrnyou stop blaming him Allyson, Just shut up, ok,\" Danny screamed atrnher. At this Allyson felt tears prickling the inside of her eyes asrnshe starred at him. \"Danny…pleasernjust listen to me,\" she begged him as the tears began to roll downrnher checks. Dannyrnshook his head saying, \"Why, so I can be lied to more, hm Ally isrnthat what it is?\" \"No…pleasernlisten to me,\" she cried taking a step closer towards him, but hernbacked away. Sighing she lowered her eyes to the floor whispering,rn\"Please…Danny, just trust me…please.\" Whenrnhe didn't respond she turned to go not looking up at him. Just asrnshe was about to go he asked softly, \"What's that on you'rernhand?\" Glancingrnover her shoulder she asked softly, \"What did you say?\" \"Yourrnhand, is it a birth mark or something?\" he asked pointing to herrnright hand. Allyson raised her eyebrows, but looked down at her palm.rn\"You mean my star birth mark?\" she asked turning around lookingrnfrom her palm to Danny and back again. \"Yeah…didrnyour parents ever say if it meant anything?\" he asked starring atrnher intently. Allyson shook her head, but looked at Danny with herrneyes questioning him. Danny took a step forward saying, \"could yourncome into my room?\" \"Yournjust yelled at me and now you're inviting me into your room,\"rnAllyson said sarcastically looking at him. Danny gave a small laughrnand nodded gesturing for her to follow him inside. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Oncerninside Allyson asked, \"So what is it that you wanted to show mernDanny?\" Dannyrnsat down across from her by the desk, not saying anything for a fewrnmoments. After a few seconds he cleared his throat saying, \"I havernsomething to show you Ally…I found them that day in the library.\" Shernnodded, but looked around the room, it seemed familiar to her, butrnshe couldn't place it. Looking at Danny she said, \"Well what isrnit?\" \"Okrnfrom what I gather some wizards pass down their powers to therernoffspring if they're killed. And the magic forms a mark on thosernwho resave those powers.\" \"Ok,rnyou've lost me,\" Allyson said. Takingrna deep breath he went on, \"Alright remember when you talked aboutrnAntino Demilo founding the mansion and his family.\" Shernnodded, but couldn't understand where he was going with this. Dannyrnturned to the documents on the table. He picked one up and handed itrnto her, \"I found out the maidin name of his wife…\" his voicerntrailed off of his eyes fell down on the paper. Following his leadrnAllyson glanced down and she read the page. Herrneyes grew wide with shock as she read. Antino Demilo wasrnmarried on June 20 1980 to the beautiful Genevieve Miller. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, now you know who the father is if you hadn't already gussed it.

Finally she put the document back on the desk beforernlooking at Danny. Quietly she said, \"So…it wasn't a dreamrnthan.\" \"Whatrnwasn't a dream?\" Danny asked taking her hand in his and robbingrnhis thumb in small circles on the back of her hand. She didn'trnspeak for a few moments her mind racing with questions and her dreamsrnat the same time. Finallyrnshe said, \"I've been having these weird dreams ever since we gotrnhere and I think it was about Antino…um I mean …my Dad.\" \"Really,\"rnDanny said looking at her. She nodded as she glanced around the room. \"Yearnand I think this used to be his room actually,\" she said turning tornlook at him. \"Howrndo you know?\" \"Irndon't know I just do,\" Allyson said quietly a small amount ofrnfear in her voice. \"Yournok?\" Danny asked gently. She nodded, but he could see tearsrnrimming her eyes. \"I'mrnfine, Danny really,\" she said, but she lowered her eyes to thernfloor. \"Hey,rndon't worry about it…it'll be fine,\" Danny said moving overrnto site beside her. \"It'srnjust…every things happening so fast,\" she said her tears nowrnrolling down her face. Gently turning her to face him, he used hisrnindex finger to whip away the tears saying, \"I know, but it'll bernfine…Sara's back, you have me and anything you could want here.\" \"Irnknow, but…\" her voice trailed off as her tears began to flowrnfaster down her face. Danny pulled her into a side hug and strokedrnher hair softly. After a few minutes her sobs had turned to whimpersrnand she pulled away from Danny's embrace. \"What'srnwrong?\" he asked gently looking at her concerned. \"I'mrnfine Danny, really…look I'm tired, I think I'm going to go tornbed…night,\" she said standing up and going over the door. \"Alright…nightrnAlly, sweet dreams,\" he called after her. She glanced over arnshoulder a smile on her lips as she said, \"Night Danny, sweetrndreams.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Withrnthat she left the room and went to bed. Finally able to get some restrnafter all the events that had happened over the past few days. Earlyrnthe next morning she awoke with someone shaking her gently. Groaningrnand still half a sleep, she asked, \"What is it?\" \"Ally,rnit's me Sara.

Get up, Danny's GONE!\" Sara cried out. Atrnthat Allyson bolted up in bed her eyes wide with fear as she lookedrnat Sara. \"Whatrndo you mean he's gone?\" she asked her voice filled with fear andrnslight anger. Atrnthat Allyson bolted up in bed her eyes wide with fear as she lookedrnat Sara. \"Whatrndo you mean he's gone?\" she asked her voice filled with fear andrnslight anger. \"Irndon't know, what's wrong?\" \"Irnknow, but what if Max has him Sara?\" Allyson asked turning aroundrnto star at her. Sara pushed some of her blonde hair behind her rightrnear and then realization of what Allyson had said sank in. Herrneyes grew fear she glanced at her sister, and then both of themrndarted out of her bedroom and went looking for him. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Theyrnsearched for what seemed like forever, but there was no sign of himrnanywhere. \"AnythingrnSara?\" Allyson asked walking into the library. Sara looked up andrnsilently shook her head. Allyson lowered her eyes, but slammed herrnfist on the table cursing under her breath. \"Whererncould he be?\" she asked herself looking down at the table. Sararnglanced up saying, \"Do you think Max really \"Irndon't know, but if so I'm going to kill Max with my own twornhands,\" Allyson said pounding her fist in her palm. Sara starredrnat her sister, a little afraid. She had never seen Allyson this crazyrnor had ever heard her talking about murder. Just before Sara couldrnsay anything, she heard a noise coming from behind one pf the otherrnales of books. TappingrnAllyson on the shoulder Sara pointed to the source of the noise andrnholding each others hands the two sisters walked over and peekedrnaround the corner to find. \"Danny,\"rnthe two sisters cried as they ran up to him and hugged him. Confusedrnhe hugged them back, but asked, \"What's going on?\" \"Sararncouldn't find you and we went looking all over for you, but stillrncouldn't find you, we thought Max might have come,\" Allyson saidrnbarely taking a breath as a spoke looking into his eyes. \"I'mrnsorry I made you worry, but I wanted to do some research on therninformation we found earlier,\" he said pulling away from the hug tornreveal a computer behind him. Allysonrnnodded, but mouthed, \"Find anything?\" He nodded simply, butrnglanced at Sara, who was looking at some books and shook his head. Allyson nodded her understanding and called out, \"Sara, why don'trnyou go along and get some breakfast. You must be starving.\" \"ButrnAlly,\" Sara began, but Danny interopted. \"Please Sara, I need torntalk to Allyson a lone, but we'll tell you all about it laterrnpromise.\" \"Ok…fine,\"rnSara said as she headed back down the ale and out of site. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When shernwas gone Allyson asked, \"So, what did you want to talk aboutrnDanny?\" \"Well,rnlook what I found Ally,\" he said gesturing to the screen and forrnAllyson to take a seat. Takingrnit, she looked over the page on the scene. It was on her father andrnwhat had happened to him with a picture of him in his coffin. He wasrnwhite and on his finger was a red ring…that she knew well. \"Dannyrnhold up your ring finger to the picture please,\" Allyson asked fearrnin her voice. Danny did as he was told and soon Allyson gasped. Thernrings were exactly the same. Just then her dreams came flooding backrnto her in a rush. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \" Mr.rnDemilo, I have a peasant for you,\" the 40 year old student saidrnhanding out a box. Her father took it and slipped the box in his coatrnand facing his student. Next She saw her father on stage. He wasrndoing on his tricks that he had done many times before. Just as hernwas taking a bow the weight began to fall. Allyson screamed, \"Dadrnlook out,\" but it didn't work. She watched in horror as herrnfather was killed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Comingrnout of the vision, she gasped and turned to Danny, \"It was MaxrnDanny.\" \"Whatrnare you talking about?\" he asked looking at her confused. \"Max,rngave my dad that ring and then killed him. MAX KILLED MY FATHER,\"rnAllyson screamed looked at Danny with augur in her eyes. \"Yes,rnmy dear and soon you will join your father and at least I'll getrnthe powers that are rightfully mine,\" a cold evil voice said fromrnbehind them.[Chapter 29] Here's the next chapter, I hope you enjoy it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Max,rngave my dad that ring and then killed him. MAX KILLED MY FATHER,\"rnAllyson screamed looked at Danny with augur in her eyes. \"Yes,rnmy dear and soon you will join your father and at least I'll getrnthe powers that are rightfully mine,\" a cold evil voice said fromrnbehind them. Allysonrnjumped out of her seat and spun around to face Max. \"Whatrnare you doing here Max?\" Danny said taking a step towards him andrnholding onto Allyson's arm as she glared daggers at Max, but notrnsaying anything. Max smirked at her not saying anything. Finallyrnshe spoke her voice icy and filled with all the anger she held forrnhim, \"Why, you bustard?\" \"Manners…mannersrnAllyson, your father didn't teach you very well,\" Max said. Atrnthis Allyson nearly lodged at him, but Danny held her back saying,rn\"Allyson stop.\" Yet,rnshe didn't seem to hear him, but thought to herself, \"I'm goingrnto kill Max I swear I will.\" \"Coolrnit Ally, not yet,\" she heard another voice say in her mind. She wasrnso startled by the other voice that for a few moments and thenrnrealized it was Danny, she had heard. Finally she calmed down enoughrnfor Danny to release her, but she was still glaring at Max with purernhatred. \"Well…itrnseems Demilo had a few tricks up his sleeves that I wasn't countingrnon,\" Max said. Danny moved next to Allyson, but said nothing. Herncould feel Allyson's tension as she starred at Max grow. \"Whatrndo you mean?\" Allyson asked though clenched teeth like a lion. Maxrntook a step forward as a fire ball appeared in his hand; he hurled itrnat them smirking. Yet at that same instate Allyson held up her handsrnpalms face out and a force field appeared in front of them, stoppingrnthe ball from even touching them. Loweringrnher arms, the force field disappeared Max gave her an evil smilernsaying, \"Now that is impressive, you already seem to have control.\" \"Yournmean like this,\" Allyson said waving her hand at him and sendingrnhim flying ton a book case. Speechless Allyson just stood therernunable to move. Finally Danny touched her shoulder causing her torncome back to reality. Max was just getting up and she glanced atrnDanny. \"RUNrnNOW!\" Allyson cried as she began to run down the hall, Dannyrnfollowing close behind her. Yet Max raised his hand and the libraryrndoor closed and locked before them. Spinningrnback around Danny asked, \"Now what?\" Withrnout saying a word Allyson grabbed his arm and the two ran behindrnanother book case, with Max walking towards them. Both Danny andrnAllyson looked around, but there was no where to go they wererncornered. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter more soon please review.[Chapter 30] Here's the next chapter, Hope you enjoy it. ------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------- Allysonrnheld her breath, but her mind was racing with ideas. Danny wasrnclutching her hand tightly his hand now sweating. She could almostrnfeel his heart pounding along side hers. She could hear Max walkingrntowards them and she felt as if she was that ten year old childrnagain, alone and scared to death. \"It'llrnbe ok Ally,\" Danny told her soothingly in her mind. She stopped andrnstared at him for a few seconds. She realized as she starred into hisrnintent blue eyes, that she would never be alone and wasn't alone inrnthis. He would always be there with her. Maxrnwas moving in closer and every footstep brought chills of fear andrnhatred running down Allyson's spine. \"You think you can hidernforever Allyson,\" Max called out firmly. Allyson tensed, butrnmanaged to get out, \"Why Max, why kill my Dad?\" \"Ohrnfor power, my dear…imagine my surprise when his powers didn'trncome to me,\" Max said a low growl in his throat. Allyson's eyernbrows narrowed in confusion as she looked at Danny. UnderstandingrnDanny called back, \"What do you mean Max?\" Maxrnsmirked as he turned and began walking towards the book case, whichrnthe voices had come from. As he walked up he said, \"Well…Irndidn't understand it then, but if a wizard is killed then hisrnpowers will go to the offspring…if any, and imagine my surprisernwhen I learned Demilo had them.\" \"Yournmean… you planned on adopting Sara and me, but how did you know?\"rnAllyson asked not being able to keep the fear out of her voice. Dannyrncould see the fear in her eyes and brought her into a hug, but hisrnown heart was pounding, that he almost missed Max's reply. \"Well,rnI remembered him talking about his wife once, that stupid mortalrnGenevieve Miller…and all I had to do was be a concerned friend andrnboth you and your brat sister were MINE…and you still are.\" \"Yournleave Sara alone Max,\" Allyson cried as loud as she could muster.rnShe could hear Max getting closer, but then she heard a voice thatrncaused her to go pale in one second. \"Ally,rnyou there,\" Sara called out. Danny could see Allyson and he feltrnher body grow tense and he could feel her hand almost crash his own,rnbut he made no sound. Both of them heard Max turn and beginning tornwalk in the direction of Sara. \"Yournleave her alone,\" Allyson cried suddenly running out from behindrnthe book case facing Max. Yet Max didn't bother to turn around, butrnlifted his hand and Sara flew over to him. \"Now,rnyou wouldn't want anything to happen to Sara, would you Allyson,\"rnMax sneered turning around to face her with his arms wrapped aroundrnSara tightly. Allyson's blood began to boil, but her heart wantedrnto break into a million pieces. Sara's blue eyes were wide withrnterror as she tried to get away from Max, but he held her tightly. \"Nowrnbe a good little girl and give me your powers, and I'll let herrngo,\" Max said taking a step towards Allyson. Allyson bold herrnhands into fists, her knuckles going white as she clenched herrnfingers into her palms, unsure of what to do. Seeing her frustration andrnpain caused Max to laugh softly Maxrnwas so caught up in getting Allyson that he didn't even noticernDanny coming up behind him. Angling his hands like Allyson had done,rnDanny pushed them out, palms out and a guest of wind flew all aroundrnhim and into Max's back, causing him to fall to the ground. Sararnreached forwards and bite Max's hand, hard enough to draw blood. Hernreleased her shoving her away and jumping up to face Danny muttering,rn\"Bitch,\" under his breath. Danny stared at Max hard, but calledrnover to Allyson, \"Allyson, you and Sara get out of here NOW!\" \"WhatrnNO WAY,\" Allyson almost yelled back holding Sara in her arms. Maxrnshot a fire ball at Danny, but he dodged it. \"GOrnNOPW!\" he commended as he threw his own fire ball at Max. Sararnpulled away from her sister and headed towards the door. When she sawrnAllyson still standing there, she ran up to her and tugged at her armrnsaying, \"Ally, we have go NOW!\" Allysonrnwatched as Danny was thrown to the ground, but rolled out of the wayrnas an energy ball was thrown at him. He glanced up at her and glancedrntowards the door once before going back to fight Max. Allyson didn'trnmove her mind racing and her heart aching all at once. With a firmrntug on her arm from Sara, Allyson snapped back to reality and shernreluctantly, followed her little sister out of the room. SincernSara hadn't shut the door behind her, it was open already. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The twornsisters ran out of the room and ran up fleets of stairs and throughrndeserted hallways, until they came to the dinning room. Mr. and Mrs.rnSinclair were sitting at the table going through same documents withrna few other people. \"Allyson,rnwhere have to guys been and who is this?\" Mr. Sinclair askedrnlooking at Sara. Allyson explained in a rush and the added, \"Couldrnwe stay here for a little bit?\" \"Ohrncourse Allyson, make yourself comfortable,\" Mrs. Sinclair saidrnturning back the other people at the table. Just as Allyson down, shernheard a deifying scream ring thought her mind. She knew at once whornit was, Danny. Turning to Sara she whispered, \"Sara, I have to gornDanny needs me, stay here.\" \"NornAlly,\" Sara whispered back fear in her voice. Allyson placed herrnhands on her sister's hands and said gently, \"Sara, I really needrnyou to stay here, promise me you'll stay here and be safe.\" Sararndidn't say anything for a few moments, but then slowly nodded herrnhead. Allyson brought her sister into a tight hug and kissed the toprnof her hair and whispered, \"I'll be back, with Danny I love yournSara never forget that.\" Withrnone finally embrace, the sisters parted. Allyson quietly stood up andrnleft the room. No one took any notice of her and she was glad. Oncernoutside of the room she heard Danny's scream again and she ran asrnfast as she could back to the library. She wouldn't let Danny getrnhurt again. So she raced on towards the fight hoping to save Danny,rnbut also to right a wrong that had caused her great suffering for thernpast four years. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hope you enjoyed this chapter, More soon promise please review.[Chapter 31] Here's the last chapter, I know it's been a while, but I was had writers block. I own nothing, but the plot and Sara. I hope you enjoy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Danny gasped as a fire ball hit him the side, but he wouldn't give in. Max smirked as he said, \"You really think you're saving them from me…it's only a matter of time before those bitches are mine.\" \"No way,\" Danny yelled as he sent a blast of wind towards Max, but Max didn't even step back an inch. \"Is that the best you have Danny,\" Max asked mockingly. Danny gritted his teeth in frustration but said nothing. \"Leave him alone Max!\" a voice called from behind them. Before Max could even turn his head around, a blast of air and a fire ball hit him the shoulder and sent him flying away from Danny. \"Now that was pay back,\" Allyson said placing her hands on her hips looking at Danny triumph. Danny didn't say anything, but ran up to her. And grabbed her hand and ran. \"What are you doing here Allyson, you have to go NOW!\" he cried in desperation. \"No way Danny, I'm not leaving you again,\" Allyson cried taking a step back away from him. Danny took a step forward and placed both hands on her shoulders, \"Listen to me I can deal with Max go.\" \"No and you won't be able to defeat with that ring on your finger,\" Allyson said moving out of Danny's reach and taking his hand in hers about to take the ring off, when a fireball flew at them, causing both of them to separate. Allyson's head snapped around her eyes seemed to be on fire as she glared at Max. \"Leave him alone Max, I mean it,\" she shouted as she sent an energy ball at him, but he was prepared this time and brushed it off with a wave of his hand. \"Is that the best you've got,\" Max asked with a small smirk on his face. Allyson gave low growl from the bottom of her throat. A fireball formed in his palm and Allyson ready herself for an attack, but at the last moment Max spun to the right and sent the fire ball at Danny. He was flung back and collapsed on the ground. Allyson cried out and ran over to him. Kneeling down next to him she pulled off the ring and threw it to the other side of the room. \"Ow, that hurt,\" Danny mumbled as he rubbed his head. \"Are we fighting here?\" Max asked annoyed slightly. Danny sat up and turned around and sent his hands up to send a gust of wind at Max, but Max only took a few steps back. Allyson held onto his hand saying, \"We have to do this together.\" Danny nodded slightly and turned to face Max. Soon the fighting resumed at the top of its height. Fire and energy balls flying all around the room. Danny fall down on his side with a cry of pain. Allyson held her own side tenderly, but glared at Max. Just then a voice called out from the entrance. \"Ally, you in here?\" \"Sara get away from here,\" Allyson cried trying to get Max's attention off over her little sister. Max smirked as he said, \"Well, Ally why not let your sister play with the big kids.\" \"You leave her alone Max,\" Allyson cried sending a fireball at him, but he dodged out of the way. Max stood up again and shot two energy balls, one at each of Allyson's most treasured life. \"NO!\" she screamed at the top of her lungs as both Danny and Sara fall to the floor almost lifeless. Tears rolled down her face, but in her heart she felt a burst of loathing. \"STOP IT\" she yelled at Max. Just then a blinding light formed around her and blasted out towards Max and son the room was covered the whole room. When it finally faded, Max was gone and she collapsed into darkness. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"Allyson, Ally, wake up,\" a voice called though the darkness. Her eyes fluttered open and she found herself starring into Danny's dark blue eyes. \"Danny, you're all right,\" Allyson whispered smiling. Danny nodded smiling back. \"Ally, you're alive,\" another voice called from her right. She turned her head and saw her sister's smiling face. Allyson sat up with Danny's support and hugged her sister tightly. \"How are you feeling?\" Danny asked brushing her bangs out of her face. \"I'm fine, how are you?\" Allyson asked. He nodded smiling. He leaned in for a kiss, but she held her hand up. He looked confused, but then remembered Sara. Sara giggled as she pulled away from her sister saying, \"Go for it Ally.\" All of them laughed and then Danny and Allyson looked at each other directly in their eyes. They leaned in closer and closer until their lips met in a passionate kiss. Breaking a part she whispered, \"I thought I'd lost you Danny.\" \"Me too, but I'm here with you forever,\" he replied tenderly. They leaned in again and didn't pull away. Finally Sara cleared her throat and asked, \"What about me?\" Both teenagers glanced at each other and opened their arms and Sara ran into them and hugged them both tightly. Allyson smiled at her sister and Danny. She loved them both and she was loved in return after all these years and nothing and no one could take that away from her ever. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope you've enjoyed the last chapter.

Note: If it sounds like a 14yr old wrote it it's because a 14 yr old DID write it. Yes, I was 14 when I wrote this so I understand there's a lot of illogical things and many flaws. I posted it anyway, and won't be taking it down, because at the time of completion I was extremely proud of it. He sat on his bunk in the mid-day Vietnamese heat where it was a cool 100 degrees in the shade. The only thing he could stand to wear were his shorts. Everything else just made it more unbearably hot. Besides his shorts he wore his dog tags. He would never take them off. In his tent there were two cots. He was the only one who slept there though. He wanted to be left alone. He didn't want to have too many connections with people. He had severed all his ties with people before arriving here. Why? Because this is where he intended to die. To die in the field with honor, just as his fathers before him had. He was Lt. Dan Taylor. A soldier with a destiny.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. He walked alongside his sister, a small reporter, who had been assigned to stay here for a few days and make a report about the soldiers in Vietnam. He had to watch out for her now since she was not paying attention to where she was going. He was certain she was going to trip over something. He had been here for a week, he knew how easy it was to trip over something. He was also worried about her. Not because his only sister, and only living relative, was going to be alone soon. Either temporarily or permanently. All his other family members had died in battle. He believed it was a curse. He wanted to break that curse. It was his chosen destiny. He was Paul Gracings. A soldier with a curse to break.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. She walked alongside her brother, a strong soldier, who had only been stationed here in Vietnam for a week. Like everyone else he was going off to fight in 6 days. She jotted down notes of her surroundings to keep from thinking about what could happen to him. He was all she had left. Her mother had been killed, her father was killed during World War II, she had no one else. All the others in the family had been killed in one war or another. She saw it as a curse. She couldn't lose her brother to some stupid curse. She just couldn't. She believed she had a destiny too. To live a normal, boring life. She was Rabecca Gracings. A reporter with a boring destiny.[Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Rabecca and Paul walked down the wooden walkway to Lt. Dan's tent. He was about to have a new roommate. Rabecca was a little scared for herself since she was the only female around, however, her fear for her brothers life overpowered the fear for her own self. \"You know, if you don't watch out where your walking, your going to trip over something.\" Paul told her. \"Uh huh.\" Rabecca answered, still not looking up from her notebook. \"I'm serious.\" Paul said. \"There is so much shit laying around that its hard NOT to trip.\" he walked around an abandoned grill fork. \"Why don't you --\" was all Rabecca had time to say before she did trip over something. However, instead of her colliding with the ground, someone caught her. Once she had been let go of and she fixed herself up she looked up at the man who had just caught her. He was handsome and she couldn't help but blush. The man smiled at her. \"Told you so.\" Paul said as he picked up Rabecca's pen and notebook. \"Rabecca, this is Lt. Dan. Lieutenant, this is my sister Rabecca.\" Paul reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper and handed it to Lt. Dan. \"So,\" he said. \"You'll be staying with me for a few days.\" \"Yes sir.\" Rabecca said. \"Alright then. There is an empty bunk inside. You can go in and put your things down then you can either go get something to eat over there or you can play a game of baseball. There are a few soldiers playing over there who would let you play. Or you can just stay inside. It doesn't really matter. I have to go and remind someone that they are NOT supposed to throw things at my tent.\" he looked to his right and spotted the soldier who, by the look on the lieutenants face, was in a huge amount of trouble. \"You better get inside.\" Paul said as Lt. Dan walked off. \"He's a pretty loud yeller. At least in the tent it might not be as loud. I'll see you later okay, I have a few things I need to do.\" \"Alright.\" Rabecca said. They hugged and said goodbye . Rabecca went inside and put her stuff down on the cot she would be staying in for the next few days.[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the characters you know She sat down next to her backpack, took out her notebook and started to make notes on some of the things she saw in the tent. It was small but if fit two cots comfortably with enough room left over for a crate to keep things in, a small table, and still have enough walking room. At the end of Lt. Dan's bed there was a trunk. Rabecca assumed it was full of clothes. On top of it there was his backpack, all ready for combat. Next to the backpack his helmet and two guns. One was the standard gun used for combat, and the other was a small black handgun. Rabecca put her notebook down and walked over to the gun. She'd never held one before despite her entire family being in the military. She held the handgun in both hands being careful to not touch the trigger. She didn't want to end up shooting herself. She could be quite clumsy at times. \"My father bought me that.\" came a voice from behind her. She jumped at the sound of it and if Lt. Dan had not been standing close behind her, the handgun would have fallen to the floor. \"Careful.\" he said. \"We wouldn't want you or anyone else to get hurt.\" He backed away from Rabecca in order to give her some room. Rabecca went over to the bed and sat down. \"Sorry.\" she said, shaking. The lieutenant put down the gun and sat down next to Rabecca. He wrapped his arm around her and asked, \"are you okay?\" \"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.\" she said. She started to cry a little. \"What's wrong?\" he asked. \"It's just. What if…Paul…What if something happens to him? He's the only family I have left! Everyone else is dead!\" she cried. \"Same here. Except I don't have anyone.\" he said. \"Aren't you afraid?\" Rabecca asked. \"No. Not for myself anyway.\" he took a deep breath. \"Its my destiny to die in the field just like my family. Its my job to keep everyone else safe. To the best of my capability.\" \"My brother thinks differently.\" she said. \"Oh yeah.\" he said. \"what does he say?\" \"He says that it's a curse on our family that everyone keeps dying. He's determined to break it. That's what he says his destiny is.\" she explained. \"Well, I hope he does then.\" he said. \"So, do you think you have a destiny?\" \"I don't know. I guess. Its probably to get married, have kids, live a normal boring life, and die. At least I hope the marriage part. I cant hold down a relationship at all.\" she explained. \"Why not?\" he asked. \"I'm a bit of a…workaholic.\" she laughed a little. \"I'm trying to write the perfect article.\" \"How is that going so far?\" he asked. \"I haven't gotten there yet. But hey, the job puts bread on the table.\" she sighed. \"Why do you ask so many questions?\" She asked as she took off her glasses and put them in their case. \"Because you are interesting.\" he said. \"Oh well would you look at that. You're funny too! That was a good one.\" she said. \" No, I'm serious.\" he said. \"You really are interesting.\" \"Well thank you. I bet your pretty interesting too.\" Rabecca said. \"I doubt that.\" he said. Both of them sat in silence lost in their thoughts for a little while. Once Rabecca came back to the real world she realized that Lt. Dan was still holding her from when she was crying. Normally she would have said something but right now she felt lonely, scared and tired. She wanted to be held. So she just closed her eyes, rested her head on the lieutenants shoulder and fell asleep.[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the characters you know. Rabecca woke up suddenly. From the way she was sleeping she would have fallen out of the small cot had there not been strong arms wrapped around her. The tent was dark but there were fires going outside so it was probably between the hours of 9pm and 12am. Rabecca felt herself start to cry again. \"You okay Rabecca?\" she heard Lt. Dan ask. \"Sure.\" she said. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" he asked. \"No. Not really.\" she told him. \"Is there anything I can do?\" he asked. \"Just…just stay here.\" Rabecca said clutching onto his arms. \"Alright.\" he said. \"I will.\"[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the characters you know. 'What the hell are you doing?' he thought. 'You are supposed to be severing all ties with people! Not making them! You have no future with her. Your days are numbered! You will be dead soon, and she will be going home. In three days you will never see her again.' he sighed. 'Why did she have to come here? Why does she have to be so beautiful? Why do I have to have all these feelings for her?' Even with all these thoughts he was still tempted to kiss the top of Rabecca's head in hopes to comfort her. He wanted to so badly that it hurt. Instead he just held onto her tightly. 'This is not going to end well.' he thought. 'Not going to end well at all.'[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I don't own any of the characters you know. Over the next few days Rabecca stayed with Lt. Dan and the two of them got to know each other a lot more. At night they would stay up talking until everyone else had gone to sleep. Unfortunately the closer the two of them got the more nightmares Rabecca would have. When she first arrived here her nightmares were mostly of just her brother dying, but now they were about Lt. Dan dying as well. Even though Rabecca felt as if she could tell Dan about it she wasn't going to. He would ask, but she wouldn't tell. But now she was going to be leaving in 24 hours. This was her last night with her brother and Dan. And her nightmares were getting to be worse than ever.[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I don't own the peoples you know (Ha! Changed it up a bit). 3AM. The entire place was as silent as the grave. Every person and every animal had gone to sleep a while ago. Even Rabecca, who now feared sleep as if it were the plague, had fallen asleep. Suddenly the silence was broken by a loud scream. \"Dan!\" Rabecca screamed as she woke up violently from yet another nightmare. Her worst so far. The once sleeping lieutenant woke up startled but alert and on guard. His hand instinctively clutched around the knife he kept by his bed. When his brain woke up enough to process what had happened he dropped the knife and walked over to Rabecca who was sobbing into her pillow. He sat down next to her on the bed and picked her up and held her in his arms while she cried on his shoulder. \"Shhh.\" he said. \"It was just another nightmare.\" Then, gun in hand, Paul burst into the tent. \"What happened?\" he demanded as he looked around. \"Relax soldier. She just had a nightmare.\" Dan informed him. Paul put his gun down and sat on the other side of Rabecca. \"Hey, you okay Becky?\" he asked as he put his hand on her shoulder. She didn't answer. She instead held on tighter to Lt. Dan. Right now she only wanted him. She didn't him to go out and fight. She didn't want him to die. She wanted to be with him. \"Becky?\" Paul said again. \"Are you okay?\" Rabecca for some reason got angry and screamed \"No! No I'm not okay! And I never will be!\" Rabecca pried herself away from Lt. Dan and ran out of the tent. She ran past all the stares of the other soldiers she had woken up and down to the beach. The moon was full and bright and gave the shore a sort of glow. Rabecca sat on a large rock enjoying the view and how the wind cooled her down. Back in the tent Lt. Dan sat, confused, next to Paul who was just as confused as to why Rabecca freaked out. Paul sighed and said \"I never should have let her come here. I should have told her agency to send someone else. But she insisted on coming along.\" he looked at Lt. Dan. \"This isn't the first time she's had these nightmares. They were this bad 23 years ago when our father was in World War II. She was only 4. I thought she'd have grown out of it. I guess she hasn't.\" Dan didn't know what to say to that. He knew how Rabecca must have felt back then because he had felt the same way. \"I think you should go find her.\" he said. \"Who knows what's out there.\" \"yeah.\" Paul agreed as he looked at the ground. He got up, picked up his gun and left the tent to find his sister.[Chapter 10] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Lt. Dan laid down in Rabecca's cot and sighed. He wished he could make her feel better and to make her not be so afraid. However, he realized that he didn't even know what was making her so upset. That was the one thing she just wouldn't tell him. He rolled over and upon doing so he felt something hard inside the pillow. He pulled the object out and saw that it was Rabecca's notebook. Ever since Rabecca got here she had been scribbling things inside of it. He felt it wasn't any of his business so he never tried to read it before. But now, he was very curious. He opened the notebook and skimmed through all the pages until he saw his name. Next to it he saw some notes. Words such as 'tough', 'strong', 'good leader', and 'witty'. As he read he couldn't help but smile. He took the pen out of the binding and wrote down Rabecca's name. Next to it he wrote 'beautiful', 'smart', 'I wont for get you. You'll never be alone.' Underneath that he signed his name. He then closed the notebook and put it back into the pillow just like he had found it. He then got up and went to find Rabecca.[Chapter 11] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Lt. Dan walked towards the moonlit beach. When he got there he found Paul and Rabecca talking, facing the rising tide. He didn't want to interrupt or scare them so he just stood there listening. \"Why wont you tell me?\" Paul asked. \"I know you've been having nightmares about me dying but what else has been bothering you?\" \"I don't want to talk about it okay.\" Rabecca stated. \"I'm your brother! Why cant you tell me! Why are you trying to push me away? Why cant you just tell me!?\" he said angrily. Rabecca stood up and turned so she was looking down at him. Her back was to the tide and the water was hitting her bare ankles. \"Fine!\" she yelled. \"You want to know what's wrong? I'm in love with Dan! Every night I now not only have to watch you die, but him too!\" I love both of you and now I'm going to lose you and be alone! That's what's bothering me!\" \"You're in love with Lt. Dan?\" Paul asked. \"Did I stutter? Yes Paul. I love him. A lot.\" Rabecca looked up and wiped off her face on her arm. When she looked straight ahead her eyes met Dan's. \"Oh god.\" she whispered when she saw him. She turned around to face the ocean and stared at the sand on her feet. Dan walked over to her and turned her around to face him. He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head so she was looking at him. Her eyes were red and puffy from all the crying but he still thought she was beautiful. He leaned down and kissed her. \"Don't cry over me.\" he said. \"I'm not worth it.\" \"Don't say that.\" Rabecca said. \"You are worth it.\" \"Look Becca. I do love you but…\" he started. \"But come tomorrow we will never see each other again.\" she finished. \"Unfortunately.\" he whispered. He pulled her close to him and rested his head on her shoulder. Rabecca noticed the increase in his breathing and his tight hold on her. He was trying not to cry. Rabecca held onto him tightly and tried her best to comfort him. She felt just as he did but right now she had to be strong for him. Lt. Dan was trying the best he could not to cry. His throat was on fire and his eyes watered but he didn't want to cry. He couldn't. He had to be strong for her.[Chapter 12] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Rabecca stood on the beach waiting for the helicopter that would take her to the airport to arrive. Her brother was practically hugging her to death while her new friends, Dallas, Cleveland, Tex, Bubba, Forrest, and of course Lt. Dan stood and watched. When Paul finally let go she turned to face the soldiers that had come to see her off. She worked her way down the line hugging everyone and telling them to be careful. Finally she got to Dan. She immediately hugged him and said \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" he said. \"Be careful.\" she said. \"I will be.\" he said. \"I'll miss you.\" she said. \"I'll miss you too.\" he said. \"here. I want you to have this.\" he reached down to his dog tags, pulled the lower one off the chain and handed it to Rabecca. \"I cant take that.\" she said. \"You can. I want you to have it.\" he tucked it into her hand as the helicopter showed up. He kissed her and said \"goodbye.\" \"Bye.\" Rabecca cried. Rabecca hugged her brother goodbye again and then he helped her into the helicopter. Once her brother backed away the helicopter rose into the air and turned to take Rabecca home.[Chapter 13] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Six months. It felt like a thousand years to Rabecca. What was happening to Paul? And to Dan? She hated not knowing. She headed into work late again on Monday morning. It was another late night last night. Her nightmares were worse. She went into her cubicle and pulled out a notepad and a pen. She was about to start writing when her boss walked up to her. \"Mrs. Gracings.\" he said. Rabecca turned her chair around to face him. \"Your article on the soldiers was so well received that we want you to go to an army hospital in Vietnam and write another article about that.\" he said. \"Sir, I don't think -\" she started. \"Your plane leaves In 72 hours from the airport downtown.\" he smiled. \"Don't miss it.\" He left and Rabecca put her head down on her desk. How was she going to deal with this?[Chapter 14] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. She arrived at the army hospital in Vietnam late at night 4 days later. Despite the long plane and helicopter ride she wasn't tired. She was scared. Here in this small hospital she has already seen 20 soldiers and 15 that were DOA. And she had only been here for no longer than 25 minutes. The injuries that the living had were too horrible for her to think about. Just when she thought it could get no worse, it did. Coming through the doors on a gurney was Paul. A gaping wound was in the middle of his chest. Doctors were wheeling him into a room. \"Paul!\" Rabecca screamed. She ran up to the doctor who was shutting the door to the room. \"Tell me he's going to be okay.\" she cried. \"It doesn't look good. He probably wont make it.\" he said. No sooner did the doctor finish speaking did the other doctors come out of the room. \"what happened!\" Rabecca demanded. \"Who are you?\" a second doctor asked. \"His sister and only living relative.\" she said. \"Now what happened?\" \"Ma'am.\" said the doctor. Obviously looking for the right words. \"Don't say it.\" she cried. \"we are sorry for your loss.\" the doctor said. \"No.\" she whispered. \"NO!\" Rabecca pushed past the doctors and ran into the room where her brother now lay lifeless. Just seeing him up close was enough to make Rabecca sick. There was so much blood. Rabecca looked at her brother. Only 6 months ago she had hugged him and talked to him. Now she wouldn't. Not anymore. She suddenly felt light headed and sick. She reached over to her brother and took the dog tag from around his neck. The doctors didn't need it they had the other one. Rabecca put the tag in her pocket and said goodbye to her brother for the last time. She turned to walk out of the room when she suddenly passed out from the shock.[Chapter 15] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Rabecca woke up sometime later, due to someone screaming in pain, with a headache and in a hospital bed. When she looked for the person who was in pain she saw that it was Lt. Dan. He was being lifted onto the bed next to hers. His face was covered in dirt and blood, like the rest of his body. His pants had been cut away so that they now resembled short shorts. Gaping holes were where his knees used to be. Judging by the way he was laying, he couldn't move his legs. \"Your surgery is in 20 minutes lieutenant. This should help relieve the pain.\" said a male nurse as he injected some morphine into him. The he closed the curtains around the bed and walked away. Rabecca heard Dan start to cry. Rabecca got out of the bed and collapsed onto the floor. She was still dizzy from before. Remembering what happened she pulled the dog tag out of her pocket and attached it to the chain around her neck that also carried Dan's dog tag. She stood up. She couldn't cry about it now. She had to see Dan. She pulled the curtain around Dan's bed aside. \"Dan.\" she said. He turned his head over to look at her. She gasped when she saw how deep the cut above his eye was. Dan heard her gasp and said, \"That's nothing. My legs are worse. I'm going in for surgery in 20 minutes. They said they're going to clean them out to prevent infection.\" Rabecca grabbed his hand and started to cry. \"Don't cry Becca.\" he said. \"They're going to clean me off and then I'll heal and be out of here.\" He stopped and noticed the dog tags around Rabecca's neck. \"I see you kept it.\" \"yeah.\" she said, holding it in her free hand. \"Who's the other one from?\" he asked. \"It was Paul's but…\" she couldn't finish her sentence. She couldn't bring herself to say that her only brother was dead. It was then Dan noticed the dried blood on it. \"I'm so sorry.\" he said. \"When?\" Rabecca looked around for a clock. When she found one she read the time and said, \"About 2 hours ago.\" \"I really am sorry.\" he said again. \"come here and sit down.\" he patted a spot on the bed next to him. Rabecca sat down carefully and said \"I missed you.\" \"I missed you too.\" he answered. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" she answered. The nurse from before came back and said, \"Time for your surgery lieutenant.\" \"Hold on a minute.\" Dan told him. He turned to Rabecca. \"Be here when I get back?\" he asked. \"I will be.\" she said. Then the nurse put Dan on another gurney and brought him into the operating room.[Chapter 16] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Rabecca had laid down in her hospital bed once Dan was taken away. She figured she had to be extremely tired because as soon as her head hit the pillow she feel asleep. When she woke up again it was no longer dark outside. It now had to be mid-afternoon. Rabecca looked to the bed next to her. The curtains were closed around the bed so that had to mean that Dan was back. Rabecca got out of the bed and walked over to Dan's. \"Dan?\" she asked. \"Go away!\" he said angrily. \"What?\" she asked, taken back. \"DON'T LOOK AT ME!\" he yelled. \"Why Dan?\" she asked. \"You just cant okay!\" he said. \"Dan.\" she said. Lt. Dan pulled the curtain back so that Rabecca could only see his face. It was now clean but tear stained. There were stitches above his left eye. \"I think you should just go home. You don't want anything to do with me.\" he pulled the curtain back so Rabecca couldn't see him. \"Why Dan?\" she asked. \"Why should I leave you?\" \"Why?\" he said bitterly. He violently pulled the curtains back to reveal his whole body. Rabecca looked at him. His thighs were swollen and a blotchy purple color. The rest of his legs were gone. They had to amputate them. \"Go on! Leave!\" he said, now crying. \"I don't want to.\" she said. \"I love you Dan.\" Rabecca turned his face so that he was looking at her again. \"I do love you.\" Dan smiled and grabbed Rabecca's hand. \"I love you too.\" he said. He pulled Rabecca closer to him and hugged her so tight she could barely breathe. \"Don't ever leave me.\" he said. \"I don't ever want to. I didn't want to leave you since that day 6 months ago when you caught me.\" she said.[Chapter 17] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. She may not have wanted to leave him, but she had to. Her time back in Vietnam was over. She gave Dan her address and phone number and told him that if he wanted to, he could stay with her. After Rabecca left, Lt. Dan kept to himself and didn't like anyone much. Now he was moved into the same ward as Forrest Gump. Forrest was the one who had saved his life. Dan never told Rabecca, but he was angry that Forrest had saved him. He feels that Forrest cheated him out of his destiny. Once Rabecca got home she knew she had to start on her article. However, whenever she tried she thought of Paul and found that she couldn't continue writing. She decided to ask her boss for a different assignment. She walked into work early on the following Monday so that her boss would be happy with her. 'I'll just explain what happened. He'll understand.' she thought. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. As soon as she walked into her bosses office he said, \"Rabecca. Just the girl I wanted to see.\" And before she knew it , something hard collided with her head and she was no longer conscious.[Chapter 18] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. Rabecca woke up sometime later with her hands and feet bound. She was no longer in her bosses office; she had no idea where she was. Her head was throbbing with pain as well as her feet and hands. \"Have a nice nap?\" came the familiar voice of her boss, Mr. Dirshwin. Rabecca didn't answer, she was too afraid too. \"Answer me!\" he yelled at her. \"Does it matter?\" she asked. \"No. But you should learn how to answer someone when they ask you a question. Your dear brother didn't know how to do that.\" he said like he was talking about the most insignificant of things. \"What are you talking about?\" she asked, now angry. \"That's not important right now. What is important is that you cooperate.\" he said sitting down in the one chair in the room that was about 5 feet away from Rabecca. \"You see, you have information that is valuable to us.\" \"Us?\" Rabecca asked. \"The North Vietnamese and I.\" he said like he was talking about your average next door neighbors. That's when Rabecca understood. The reason why her boss sent her to do those articles in Vietnam was because she has connections with the soldiers. Her boss was a spy, and had used her as a pawn in his little game, and now it was time for him to get his information. \"What did you do to my brother!\" she demanded. \"Tell me or I wont say a word!\" \"Alright. Fine. I'll tell you, but only because I love telling this story. It has such a nice ending.\" he said. \"I love seeing the looks on peoples faces when loved ones die.\" he smiled. \"What are you talking about? You weren't there.\" Rabecca said. \"Oh, but I was. I was one of the doctors in the face masks. I know, I look so different when I cover my face almost entirely.\" he said. Rabecca thought back to that day, even though the memory was still painful. She tried to remember the face of the third doctor but couldn't. \"What were you doing with my brother!?\" she demanded. \"If you stop asking questions then I will tell you the story.\" he said. \"Now, you see, only 12 hours before his death we captured him to try to get some information out of him. Only, like you, he didn't know how to answer people when spoken to. So therefore we had to kill him. It's such a waste. We wouldn't have killed him if he had answered our questions. We attempted to kill him by locking him in a room with a grenade. But that didn't work. So we decided to come up with a more creative way to kill him.\" he leaned back in the chair and continued with a smile on his face. \"We took him into the hospital; we posed as doctors and everyone thought we were. So once we got him into the room we took the defibrillation paddles and basically shocked him to death. I have to admit, the hospital was a great new location. Plenty of high-ranking soldiers there to pick from and interrogate.\" \"You're a horrible person.\" Rabecca said, too angry at him to be upset about her brother right now. \"Thank you. So, you're with Lt. Dan Taylor now.\" he laughed. \"Do you still love him with no legs?\" \"Of course!\" Rabecca yelled. \"That's sweet.\" he said. \"You want to hear another funny story?\" \"I doubt it will be funny.\" Rabecca said through clenched teeth. \"Maybe not to you, but I find it a rather amusing story.\" he said. \"But anyway, your precious Lt. Dan Taylor didn't have to be the legless freak he currently is.\" \"What the hell did you do!\" Rabecca interrupted. \"Let me finish.\" he answered calmly as if he was talking about the weather. \"You see, he only needed to lose one leg, but, I don't like odd numbers. So I told the surgeons to amputate both.\" \"Why!?\" Rabecca yelled. \"For my amusement of course.\" he looked at his watch. \"Oh look at the time. I have to go now, but I will be back later. And when I come back you have some questions to answer.\" he said as he got up and left the room. Rabecca heard the door locks click after the door was shut.[Chapter 19] Disclaimer: I don't own the characters you know. The room was very dimly lit. There was only one bulb hanging from the ceiling of the 20 by 20 foot room. The bulb was barely emitting enough light and looked like it could burn out at any second. While Rabecca was sitting there trying to think of how to get out, the door opened. Mr. Dirshwin literally threw an unconscious, bound and blindfolded man into the room. \"Enjoy the company.\" he spat. Since Rabecca's hands were bound in front of her it was easy to crawl over to the man and pull off the blindfold. \"Tex!\" she exclaimed when she recognized the man. It took a while for her to wake him up, he was out pretty good. Once he was awake he was just as confused as Rabecca had been. \"Where am I?\" he asked. \"Hell.\" Rabecca answered. \"Rabecca?\" he asked. \"Hello private Griffith.\" she replied. She told him all that she knew about why they were trapped here. \"Damn it.\" he said angrily. \"Where'd he get you from?\" she asked. \"The hospital. I was in the middle of physical therapy for my leg.\" he sighed. \"I'm gonna walk with a limp now, I just know it!\" \"What happened to Dallas? And Cleveland? I didn't see them at the hospital.\" she said, \"Dallas is deaf in his left ear and lost his right arm. And Cleveland…he never made it out.\" he told her. \"No.\" she gasped. \"It's true.\" he said. \"What were you doing at the hospital?\" \"I was supposed to be doing another article. I saw my brother die and I found Dan and Forrest.\" she told him. \"You were on the far side then. I was on the opposite side of the hospital. And downstairs. You wouldn't have seen me unless you were looking. And Dallas was off in the burn ward which was on the upper floor.\" he said. Suddenly the flickering light above them grew brighter and burned out completely. \"Of course.\" Rabecca muttered. \"Hey Tex, think you could untie the rope on my hands?\" \"I might be able to, if I could find your hands.\" he said. \"Good. Very good.\" she smiled.[Chapter 20] Disclaimer: I dont own any of the characters you know. \"Okay. We need a plan of action.\" Rabecca said. \"No shit.\" Tex said. \"Hey! You need to work with me here if we wanna get out.\" Rabecca snapped. \"You've been hanging around Lt. Dan too much.\" Tex yawned. \"Not as much as I would like…. How is he?\" Rabecca asked now in a very upset mood. \"He wont talk to anyone. He just lays there in his bed. He's like a giant rag doll. Forrest keeps trying to talk to him and give him ice cream to make him feel better but its not working. He doesn't even make eye contact with people. I think you're the only one he could stand to be around. Once you left though…well, he just doesn't want to live now.\" he explained. \"I wish I was with him.\" Rabecca said as a tear fell from her eye. \"I bet he wishes that too.\" Tex said. \"But anyway, how about that 'Plan of Action'?\" Rabecca snapped out of her depression. \"Alright, here's what I was thinking. You loosen the ties on my hands and feet and I'll do the same for you. Then when Mr. Dirshwin comes in, we jump him, kock him out, and run like hell.\" Rabecca said. \"That's it? Seems like running is the only fucking thing I do in this damn war.\" Tex said. \"Well we're gonna take any weapons he might have on him too.\" Rabecca said. \"Can we kill him?\" Tex asked. Rabecca thought for a moment. \"If you want to you can. I would, but I don't have the balls.\" \"Then I will. That fucking scum bag deserves it.\" Tex spat. \"That he does.\" Rabecca said. \"That he does indeed.\"[Chapter 21] Disclaimer: I dont own any of the characters you know. Even though they were both getting pretty tired neither of them could fall asleep. There was not time. Tex loosened Rabecca's ties and in turn she did the same for him. Now they had to wait for the opportune moment. The two of them sat there, exhausted, for a couple of hours before Mr. Dirshwin came in to interrogate them. \"So, now for business.\" he said. He sat down on the floor across from Rabecca and Tex. \"Hold on. I gotta piss.\" Tex said. \"Well then go and get it over with. I have important shit to do today.\" Mr. Dirshwin said in an irritated voice. \"I can't go with you watching me.\" Tex said. \"That's just fucking weird.\" \"Jesus Christ stop your bitchin' and go!\" Mr. Dirshwin said and turned around. There it was. The opportune moment. Tex and Rabecca quickly ripped off the ties, and gagged Mr. Dirshwin so he couldn't scream. Tex was strong enough to hold Mr. Dirshwin down while Rabecca took his gun away from him. \"Shoot him!\" Tex said. Rabecca stood in front of them. The way Tex had the man pinned gave her the perfect shot at his head. \"I cant.\" Rabecca whispered. \"Rabecca!\" Tex yelled. \"Tex I cant kill someone!\" she yelled back. \"He killed your brother! Are you gonna let this asshole get away with that?\" Tex argued. A gun shot sounded throughout the small room. Tex collapsed, dead, on top of Mr. Dirshwin who looked up to see who had fired the shot. Rabecca spun around and too fired the gun at the person who had appeared in the room behind her. It hit the man in the gut and he hunched over in pain. Rabecca fired again this time successfully killing him. She spun back around and without a second thought fired the gun and killed Mr. Dirshwin. Now three men lay dead on the ground around Rabecca. Rabecca walked up to Tex. A single bullet lay logged in his head and the blood ran down his face. She leaned over him to check and see if he had anything useful on him. The only thing she found was his dog tags. She took one of them off him and added it to the other two around her neck. \"Sorry Tex.\" she said crying. \"I'm so fucking sorry.\" She kissed a spot on his cheek that was untouched by his blood and then lay him down away from Mr. Dirshwin. On her way out of the room she kicked Mr. Dirshwin and spat in his face. \"Good Riddance.\" she said as she walked out of the room.[Chapter 22] Disclaimer: I dont own the ones you recognize. Rabecca walked out of the vicinity easily and quietly. She was in a state of complete shock and didn't notice much of what was going on around her. She had stopped crying when she realized that no amount of tears could erase any of the bad things that had past. Besides, this wasn't over yet. It wouldn't be over until she was home and with Lt. Dan. She knew that. Suddenly she was surrounded. One moment she was standing alone in the quiet jungle outside of the doors of the damned place she had been trapped in, feeling the cool night air and trying to keep her mind on her task, and then the next moment there were 40 or more men around her with guns pointed at her head. \"Shoot and be shot.\" One of them warned. But she had no intention of even picking up the gun at her side and trying to fight back. She knew she had no chance of winning here. She lowered the gun to the ground and stood back up. She looked around silently and tears leaked down her face again. Three men walked over to her and bound her hands and feet. She went limp as they did so. She didn't have the energy, courage, or strength to fight back. Besides what good would that do? It would just get her shot. So instead she faced the facts. She back where she started; their prisoner. Only this time, there was not going to be anyone there to help her out.[Chapter 23] Disclaimer: I don't own the people you know. It's been a long year. Lt. Dan had tried multiple times to reach Rabecca since he was released from the hospital. No one had seen or heard of her since she left. It bothered him to no end. Of course at first he was angry, and even felt betrayed. He felt that maybe she lead him on; lied to him. Maybe she never meant those things she had said to him. But then he wouldn't let that be the reason. He figured something had to be wrong. If he had friends, which he didn't, they would have said he was only kidding himself. Would have told him he's in denial. But this wasn't denial. It was a feeling; A strong feeling. He spent a good part of his year home wondering about her. Where was she? Was she hurt? Was she even alive? The plane could have crashed, she could have been in a car accident on the way home from the airport. The possibilities were endless. He could name hundreds off the top of his head. This constant feeling that something bad had happened to the only one who would probably ever love him drove him into a horrible state. He became a bitter, depressed alcoholic. Something was wrong, and he was too powerless to make it right again. Rabecca for the last year had been enslaved by her captives. There were 40 of them in total. Only three of them spoke English so she rarely knew what was going on even when they discussed their plans right in front of her face. It was hell. She would have willingly given up her soul to get out of this mess that she had been caught in. She didn't need to be there anymore. They knew she didn't have any information to give them. But they wouldn't let her go. They knew that the moment she was released it would mean their death. So there she stayed becoming their personal slave. She was forced to do anything that no one else was going to do. Clean up the rooms they kept their other prisoners in, dispose of corpses, and perform whatever sick fantasies they had in their heads. At first she had refused, but every time she did she was beaten and threatened with death. One time she told them to kill her. Of course they didn't. They were still having their fun with her. She contemplated killing herself, but her attempt only got her in more trouble and then they started tying her hands together again when they left her alone. Now however, she was free. She had been free for a whole three hours and these were some of the happiest hours of her life. The place had been discovered by American troops. They came rushing in one day and searched the place for prisoners. She was the only one, all the others had been killed and their bodies destroyed. She knew she would never be able to forget the site of those monsters destroying the body of her friend. The thought almost made her as sick as when she had to clean up the mess afterward. After they rescued her they shot as many men that got in their way. Once they were far enough away they set off explosives. Rabecca remembered laughing as she watched the explosion and the remains of the building go up in flames. When the fire was out and the troops were sure there were no survivors they called in a helicopter and sent Rabecca off to a hospital back in the states that was not currently flooded by wounded soldiers coming back from the war. Except for some new cuts and bruises all they needed to do was check her for internal damage, give her food, water, and some vitamins. She was there for three days. The worst news came on the second day. Apparently she was two months pregnant. They asked her what she wanted to do with it. Without thinking twice she knew the answer. There was no way in hell she was going to give birth to some bastards child. After the termination of the pregnancy she relaxed in the hospital for another day or two so they could monitor her and then she was released. \"I just have one question.\" Rabecca said to the nurse behind the desk. \"Yes ma'am?\" the nurse asked. \"Where am I?\" Rabecca asked. \"Phoenix, Arizona.\" the lady replied. \"Thank you.\" Rabecca said as she walked out. She walked out of the hospital muttering under her breath: 'Nearest hospital that wasn't overcrowded. ARIZONA! Of course. That's so close. Now how the hell am I going to get home?' She decided to walk around the city for a while in order to clear her head and figure out how she was getting home.[Chapter 24] Disclaimer: I dont own the people you know. And BTW, Dallas did lose his arm. Pay close attention to the soldier who tells Forrest to turn off the TV. Thats Dallas. =] She walked around Phoenix for two hours before sitting down on a bench. It was high noon and hot as hell. She was getting tired and hungry but had no money and no place to stay. She decided to just sit and rest for a while before finding a bank and praying she remembered her PIN number. As she was sitting she closed her eyes to protect them from the blinding sun for a while. She woke up sometime later by someone shaking her awake. When she opened her eyes and realized she had fallen asleep on a city bench she felt embarrassed. She thought the person who had woken her thought she was a homeless person. \"You shouldn't be sleeping on benches like that Becky.\" said the man who had woken her up. \"She rubbed her eyes and looked up to his face. \"Dallas?\" \"Hello Rabecca.\" he smiled. Rabecca stared at him for a moment. The right side of his body was marked with burn scars from the top of his ear down the side of his face and neck. She noticed that his right arm was prosthetic and she remembered everything Tex had told her before he died. \"Well you going to say anything to me or what?\" Dallas asked. \"Oh my god Dallas.\" she said, \"What happened? Tex told me you lost your arm, but he didn't say why. Nor did he tell me about all this.\" she realized her questions might not be the appropriate start to this conversation and she stopped asking questions. \"Shit. Sorry Dallas.\" \"It's okay. And hello to you too.\" he sat down next to her. \"I get it your curious. And did you say Tex? I thought you were off on the other coast with Lt. Dan.\" \"Now who's asking the questions? I'll tell you if you tell me.\" she said. \"deal.\" he answered. \"Tex and I, we were held captive in Vietnam for a while. Turns out my boss wasn't your typical jerk. He was a super jerk. Anyway, I don't really want to get into details about it, but Tex was shot, so was my boss, and I had been stuck there, and I was just released from the hospital after being there for about a week.\" she explained quickly trying not to think about it and trying to force back the negative images. \"Shit! Your boss was a fucking spy?\" he asked. \"Yeah, he worked out of the hospital in order to get information from the soldiers. He killed my brother.\" she said now tearing up a little. \"What did this asshole look like?\" he asked. After Rabecca described him Dallas jumped up and shouted, \"That guy!\" People passing by stared and he sat back down. \"That asshole hung around the burn ward a lot. I didn't like the vibes I got from him so every time he walked into the room I pretended to be asleep or completely deaf so I wouldn't have to talk to him.\" \"Good thing you didn't.\" Rabecca said. \"Who knows what that sick fuck would have done with you. God knows I don't want to think about it.\" \"You shouldn't. I'm here so it's okay.\" he hugged her. \"Dallas, you know I would have came to see you if I knew you were in the burn ward the whole time.\" she said. \"I know, but don't worry about it. That's a horrible fucking place to be. You should never have to see that shit. It's horrible and disgusting. Besides, you were with Lt. Dan.\" he said. Rabecca sighed. \"I miss him.\" Dallas felt a little pang of jealousy. He liked Rabecca. A lot. Rabecca's stomach growled and she laughed a little. \"Sorry, guess Im hungry.\" \"Well then lets go get something to eat.\" he said and stood up. \"You look like you could use a nice filling meal. You're deathly skinny.\" \"Thanks. That makes me feel loads better.\" she said. He laughed a little and held out his left hand to help her up. \"Your welcome. Now lets go. I can't carry you if you pass out.\" Rabecca grabbed his hand and stood up. \"You're an ass.\" \"Yes I am.\" he smiled and led her towards a place for the two of them to get dinner.[Chapter 25] Disclaimer: I dont own any of the people you recognize. That night Rabecca stayed at Dallas's apartment. Where else was she going to go? She had no money, no where else to go, and the only clothes she currently owned were the ones the hospital had given her. \"Here, let me see if I can find anything for you to wear.\" he said as he walked into his room. \"No, it's okay. You Don't have to give me anything.\" she said as she followed him. He looked at her and said \"Those clothes don't work for you. Besides, you need them more than I do right now.\" Rabecca realized that he was right so she went and sat his bed while he looked through his dresser for clothes for her. Eventually he pulled out a pair of dark gray sweatpants and a large army T-Shirt. \"Here, these are too small for me, wash shrunk them.\" \"Thanks Dallas.\" Rabecca said and started to change. Dallas turned around while she changed. When she was done she walked over to him and hugged him. He turned around and hugged her the best he could. As he hugged her he argued within his head. \"She's only a friend. She can't love you the way you love her.\" argued one side. \"Besides, she has Lt. Dan.\" Then the other side spoke up. \"But she doesn't know where he is. No one does.\" \"I should help her find him.\" said the other side. \"Or you could have her.\" argued the aggressive side. \"Dallas?\" Rabecca said. \"Are you okay?\" \"Huh? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.\" he lied and forced a smile. Rabecca gave back a half smile, then stood up on her tip toes and kissed him. He closed his eyes and kissed her back. After a short moment Rabecca broke the kiss and walked out of the room and into the living room. She sat down on the couch and sighed. Dallas followed her and sat next to her. \"Are you okay?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" she answered. \"Why'd all this happen to me!? My brothers gone, my parents! Danny's gone! I was being ordered around to do fucked up shit by the same fuckers who killed my brother! I saw Tex be killed and then had to clean up after! Dallas I killed two people!\" she cried when everything that had happened to her finally caught up with her. \"Shh.\" Dallas whispered as he put his arm around her. \"You had to. At least you didn't have to kill them in groups.\" He blocked the imaged of the war from surfacing with a shudder. \"If anyone here's the murderer it's not you.\" \"Dallas.\" Rabecca said softly. \"Becca.\" he answered back. They kissed again. Neither of them really wanted to break the kiss, but eventually Dallas did. \"Becca,\" he said. \"I care about you. A lot.\" \"I care about you too. I always have.\" she said. \"I know. But I also know you love Lt. Dan. You should be back with him.\" \"I know. I just don't know where he is.\" she answered. \"I'll give you money to get back home. You can get started there I guess.\" he offered. \"Dallas I couldn't take that kind of money.\" she said. \"You will though. Because I said so.\" he said. \"But Dallas….\" she protested. \"No, your taking it and that's final.\" he said.[Chapter 26] Disclaimer: I dont own any of the people you know. Rabecca stayed with Dallas for a few days. He bought her a plane ticket, clothes and gave her a thousand dollars from his savings account to help her get a new place to live. She argued with him over the money for hours but he wouldn't budge. He even threatened to hide it in her stuff if she didn't willingly take it. It was a sunny afternoon when they got to the airport. She had 5 minutes to kill so her and Dallas began their goodbyes. \"So, what are you going to do once you get to New York?\" Dallas asked her. \"I'm gonna see if I can get my old place back, then Im going to look for Dan and a job.\" she said. \"Maybe if I can save enough money I could get a private investigator to look for him.\" \"You're really desperate aren't you?\" he asked. \"You have no idea.\" she said. \"Well good luck. Let me know how it goes.\" he said. \"I will.\" she answered. \"You want me to go with you for a while?\" he asked. \"I'm good.\" she said. \"You sure?\" he asked. \"I'll be okay Dallas.\" she answered. She kissed him. \"Goodbye Dallas. Maybe I'll get to see you again.\" \"I hope so.\" he kissed her cheek. \"Goodbye Rabecca. Good luck.\" \"Thanks.\" she smiled and walked onto her plane. When she got to the airport in NY she took a cab into the city. She went up to the landlord of her old apartment building. She didn't recognize this guy though. Her old landlord was gone. A lot of things change in a year. \"Is apartment room 113 still occupied?\" she asked the new landlord. \"Yeah, but the ownership changed a year ago.\" he said. \"Do you know to who?\" she asked. \"Is it important?\" he asked. \"Yeah, I used to live there.\" she answered. \"I don't know his name, but he's in a wheelchair. Looks to me like he was in the war.\" the landlord said. \"We have other rooms open for you.\" \"No, that's okay. Thanks.\" she smiled. She left the room and walked down the hallway and knocked on the door that led to where she had lived for years. She felt a little weird knocking on her own door and almost laughed out loud. \"What?\" yelled a voice from in the apartment before the door opened. \"Hello Dan.\" she smiled. He looked up at Rabecca and a huge smile spread upon his face. \"Hello Becca.\"[Chapter 27] Disclaimer: I dont own the people you know. God I am so happy I dont have to keep typing these.
